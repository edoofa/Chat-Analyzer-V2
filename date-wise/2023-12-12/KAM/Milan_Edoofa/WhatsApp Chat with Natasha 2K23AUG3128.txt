Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.

The Business Process Management (BPM) life cycle is a systematic approach to managing and improving business processes within an organization. It consists of six stages: process identification, process analysis, process redesign, process implementation, process monitoring, and process optimization.

In the process identification stage, organizations identify the processes that need improvement or automation. In the process analysis stage, the current state of the processes is evaluated to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and areas for improvement. Once the analysis is complete, the process redesign stage involves creating a new and improved process design.

The process implementation stage involves deploying the redesigned process, which may include training employees and implementing new technology. In the process monitoring stage, organizations continuously monitor the implemented processes to ensure they are running efficiently and effectively. Finally, the process optimization stage involves making ongoing improvements and adjustments to the processes based on feedback and data analysis.

Overall, the BPM life cycle provides a structured approach to managing and improving business processes, leading to increased efficiency, productivity, and customer satisfaction

Business plays a crucial role in economic development as it drives growth, creates employment opportunities, fosters innovation, and contributes to overall prosperity. By investing in new ventures, businesses stimulate economic activity and generate income for individuals and governments through taxes. Additionally, businesses contribute to economic development in the following ways.

To commence with, Businesses are the primary source of employment in an economy. When businesses expand or new ventures are established, they create job opportunities, reducing unemployment rates and improving living standards. For instance, a manufacturing company setting up a new factory will not only employ workers but also generate indirect employment through supply chains and support services.

2. Moreso, Businesses contribute to economic growth by increasing production and productivity. Through investments in technology, infrastructure, and human capital, businesses enhance efficiency and output, leading to increased GDP. For example, the growth of the tech industry has significantly contributed to the economic development of countries like the United States and China.
Additionally, Businesses drive innovation, leading to the development of new products, services, and processes. This innovation not only improves the quality of life but also creates new industries and opportunities. For instance, the emergence of companies like Apple and Google revolutionized the technology sector, leading to economic growth and job creation.

Furthermore, Successful businesses generate profits and wealth, which can be reinvested in the economy. This reinvestment can take the form of research and development, capital expenditure, or expansion into new markets. By reinvesting profits, businesses contribute to economic development, stimulating further growth and job creation.

Moreso, Businesses often invest in infrastructure development, such as building roads, ports, and communication networks. These investments not only benefit the business itself but also improve the overall business environment and attract further investments. For example, a logistics company investing in building a new port facility can enhance trade and transportation, benefiting the entire region's economic development.

In conclusion, businesses play a vital role in economic development by creating jobs, driving innovation, contributing to GDP growth, and investing in infrastructure. Through their activities, businesses generate income, create wealth, and contribute to the overall prosperity of a nation.

20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/09/23, 8:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes
20/09/23, 8:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Correct Natasha. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. 

Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 8:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes he discussed with me
20/09/23, 8:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.
20/09/23, 8:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/09/23, 8:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes ma'am
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 8:36 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Noted
20/09/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/09/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/09/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/09/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 724 8051: I'm following
20/09/23, 8:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes,what is the cost of the admission process
20/09/23, 8:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Natasha, the registration fee, also referred to as the admission fee, falls within the range of $500 to $750. The precise amount of the fee depends on the university that accepts your application and issues a scholarship offer letter to you. This determination is made based on specific metrics, including the university's fee structure and the chosen course.

I hope you have taken a note that this fee is not an additional cost but rather a component of the first-year fee, which is paid in advance.
20/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok ,thank you
20/09/23, 8:54 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Natasha. I noticed that one of your family members left your admisison group. May I know what happened? Did they face any challenges or did they leave the group by mistake?
20/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 724 8051: I will ask her maybe she left by mistake,she didn't tell me
20/09/23, 8:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, and that will be absolutely fine Natasha, please connect with her once and let us know. On this note, we will also conclude our conversation for today and we look forward to reconnecting with you tomorrow evening. I hope that by then, you will be able to share your documents with us, and we can proceed with our discussion?

Wishing you a blessed night, and please extend our regards to your family as well.

I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
27/09/23, 4:11 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening
27/09/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok , thank you ma'am
27/09/23, 6:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Natasha,

Your input and participation are greatly crucial for your university admisison journey, and I am eager to continue our conversation.
27/09/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening ma'am,yes l'm available
27/09/23, 6:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing Natasha. Now in continuation of our discussion, let me tell you that the hard work and dedication of our student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.
27/09/23, 6:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
27/09/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 724 8051: That's great
27/09/23, 6:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed Natasha. We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.
27/09/23, 6:45 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
27/09/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 724 8051: I'm following ma'am
27/09/23, 6:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Natasha. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/09/23, 6:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/09/23, 6:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plan brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Sounding good,l'm really grateful
27/09/23, 6:51 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Noted
27/09/23, 7:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Natasha. Have you gone through the seven benefits of the Endowment Plan that I have shared with you above?
27/09/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes ma'am
27/09/23, 7:48 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/09/23, 7:49 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, you will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
27/09/23, 7:50 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, Natasha, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning you as a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
28/09/23, 5:01 am - +263 71 994 1766: Good morning everyone.lm with you and following
28/09/23, 6:50 am - +263 71 234 2437: I have been closely following. Good morning.
28/09/23, 7:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natasha,

I hope you are doing well and we find you in the best of spirits. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan. Let me help you introduce the second benefit as well.
28/09/23, 7:47 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I am also delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/09/23, 7:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain your fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/09/23, 7:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of admission, you will remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/09/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening
29/09/23, 4:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and great spirits. I want to extend my apologies for not being able to check your message yesterday evening, I was tied up with a series of meetings and, as a result, was unavailable to connect with the students. 

Also, in reference to our previous discussion, I wanted to reach out and inquire if you had the opportunity to review the second benefit of the Endowment Plan I shared with you?
29/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening,yes l reviewed the message
29/09/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you've grasped the same concept as well. Let us move to the third benefit of the endowment plan -
29/09/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

When you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
29/09/23, 8:25 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate as well with you?
30/09/23, 5:17 am - +263 78 724 8051: Ok ma'am
30/09/23, 5:20 am - +263 78 724 8051: This message was deleted
30/09/23, 5:23 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes ma'am,l wasn't able to be in touch with you yesterday  because of network, Good morning
30/09/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Natasha,

I hope you are doing well this morning and we find you in high spirits. I completely understand that you were not able to connect with us due to the network challenges, and that's perfectly fine. 

Since we were in the midst of our discussion regarding your university admission process yesterday and you have gained clarity on the first three benefits of the Endowment Plan, let us now proceed to introduce and dig deeper into the fourth benefit to ensure you have a comprehensive understanding of it.
30/09/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I am delighted to know that you are following through. Moving forward, in situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
30/09/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
30/09/23, 11:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far?
30/09/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes.l'm following
30/09/23, 12:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Glad to hear that Natasha. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I would like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
30/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Can you please provide with more information
30/09/23, 3:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 3:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
30/09/23, 3:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
30/09/23, 3:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
30/09/23, 11:35 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Natasha,

I trust this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Firstly, I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to connect with you earlier.
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: It was a long weekend here in India, which was followed by a national holiday on Monday, for Gandhi Jayanti. Gandhi Jayanti is celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. I hope you must have had the opportunity to learn about him and the principles he abided by.
04/10/23, 6:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Gandhi Ji was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a staunch advocate of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change. Because of all his contributions, Gandhi Jayanti holds significant importance to us as an annual national holiday in India.
04/10/23, 6:28 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Now that we're back to our regular operations today, I am delighted to let you know that I am available for our daily sessions. Hence, could you please confirm your availability at this moment so that we can proceed further with our discussion and move forward with your university admisison journey?
04/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening, l'm available ,we can proceed
04/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing Natasha. In that case, let's redirect our focus on the last conversation we had and in order to move further from here, I would like to get a confirmation from your end if you were able to go through my last messages?

If yes, shall I move on and help you understand the remaining three benefits of the endowment plan by helping you understand how the scholarship quantum of a student is evaluated?
04/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes we may move on with the discussion
04/10/23, 9:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Right Natasha. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
04/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes,l understand
04/10/23, 9:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: So Natasha, in such a.case, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
04/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes, l agree with the same
04/10/23, 9:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Right Natasha, so let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
04/10/23, 9:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. Reappear in A Level [Benefit Number 5]*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
04/10/23, 9:20 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
04/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes
05/10/23, 5:27 am - +263 78 724 8051: Good morning
05/10/23, 10:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well Natasha, 

I am glad to hear that you were able to take note of the benefit number 5. Let us now move forward to the second option, which is benefit number 6 of the endowment plan.
05/10/23, 10:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree [Benefit Number 6]*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 10:40 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes it's clear
05/10/23, 11:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
05/10/23, 11:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career [Benefit Number 7]*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
05/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Noted,good afternoon
05/10/23, 1:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good afternoon to you as well Natasha. Before we proceed further with our conversation, I want to create an open space for you to express any questions or concerns that may be on your mind.

 If you have any queries or if there are specific aspects of our discussion or your university admission journey that you'd like to discuss, please feel free to share them with me.
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Your input and questions are important, and I am here to assist you to the best of my ability before we move forward and commence your university admisison journey.
05/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 78 724 8051: As for me l have nothing to ask,maybe my family members
06/10/23, 12:16 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Natasha,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I would like to extend my apologies for not being able to continue our conversation yesterday. Unfortunately, I was unavailable when you replied to my messages.
06/10/23, 12:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Given that you mentioned you have no further queries and we were able to complete our discussion regarding your university admission, I wanted to inquire if you are excited to kickstart the process. 

Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's embark on this journey together to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also enjoy the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving your offer letter?
06/10/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Goodmorning, yes we can commence the process
06/10/23, 12:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Amazing Natasha, thank you for sharing the confirmation, and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
06/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Okay ma'am .Thank you
06/10/23, 12:33 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Natasha!
09/10/23, 9:19 am - ~ Tasha added +267 78 427 538
10/10/23, 11:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha,

I hope you all are doing well, and I find you in the best of spirits. I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application at the universities in India under the Endowment plan.
10/10/23, 11:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With all the efforts we have invested, I am thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, Galgotias University in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
10/10/23, 11:04 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, as we received it early, we wanted to share it with you early and get a head start on our discussions. Please take your time to thoroughly review the letter, and then we will discuss its contents in detail.
10/10/23, 11:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In the meantime, I would encourage you to note down any queries or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. When we reconnect to discuss this letter, having your questions prepared will help ensure a productive discussion. Once you have taken note of this letter, please let me know so that we can schedule our next discussion accordingly. Congratulations to you and your family! ⭐
10/10/23, 11:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 5:04 am - +263 78 724 8051: Good morning,l wasn't able to be connected with you yesterday and l am very happy to be accepted
11/10/23, 7:45 am - Vilsha Edoofa: No worries at all, Natasha. I completely understand that life can get hectic and you might have a few prior commitments, and that is perfectly okay. I am delighted to hear your positive response regarding the offer letter, and I am sure your family will be equally thrilled when they hear this news.
11/10/23, 7:46 am - Vilsha Edoofa: To ensure we can discuss the offer letter and address any questions or concerns you may have, could you kindly let me know if you'll be available to connect today before 05:00 pm? This would provide us with ample time to have a detailed conversation.
11/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes l will be available
11/10/23, 10:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for making yourself available for our scheduled discussion, I am pleased to see that you are available for our discussion. Without any more delay, I would like to commence our conversation regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University and ensure you have a clear understanding of the offer letter and its specifics.
11/10/23, 10:40 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: To ensure we are on the same page and can address any questions or concerns effectively, I kindly request you to take another look at the offer letter and provide me with the following details:

1. What is the per-semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What is the standard duration of your course?
3. What is the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable) mentioned in the offer letter?
4. Could you please confirm the Registration fee amount mentioned in the offer letter?

This information will help us proceed with a clear understanding of the offer letter and help us discuss the next steps accordingly.
12/10/23, 4:38 am - +263 78 724 8051: 1.900

12/10/23, 7:49 am - +263 78 724 8051: Good morning,l thought you were referring to CAT
12/10/23, 7:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the misunderstanding Natasha, however, I am glad to see that we are together now and we can continue with our discussion.
12/10/23, 7:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Having said that, I was also able to go through the responses you shared early in the morning, thank you for sharing the same. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
12/10/23, 7:58 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes
12/10/23, 8:01 am - +263 78 724 8051: I'm following
12/10/23, 8:03 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
12/10/23, 8:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
12/10/23, 8:04 am - Vilsha Edoofa: 2. Off-Campus Accommodation

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- Students can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist them in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If students wish to save more on accommodation expenses, they can also look for accommodation on their own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
12/10/23, 8:06 am - +263 78 724 8051: Okay ,l prefer to save more on accommodation
12/10/23, 8:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Indeed, Natasha, that would be a wise decision. With this, I am certain you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and doesn't rush when it comes to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the importance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make an informed decision about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this aligns with your understanding of the university's approach?
12/10/23, 8:20 am - +263 78 724 8051: Very well
12/10/23, 8:21 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am glad to hear that Natasha. As you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
12/10/23, 8:22 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes we may move forward
12/10/23, 8:23 am - Vilsha Edoofa: It is reassuring to see you following through Natasha. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
12/10/23, 8:24 am - Vilsha Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, your deadline for securing her scholarship seat falls on *October 25th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
12/10/23, 8:25 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yeah
12/10/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 724 8051: What about the Endowment method
12/10/23, 8:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Natasha, that is there. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
12/10/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 724 8051: Yes can you please explained further
12/10/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 724 8051: So the Admission and processing fee of 300 is not  removed from the registration fee or?
12/10/23, 8:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely Natasha. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, and as a student/parent, you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $300 before the first deadline date of *October 25th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $300 before the second deadline date of *November 25th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
12/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 724 8051: Alright
12/10/23, 8:55 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, Natash. This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the *full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before October 25th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
12/10/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 724 8051: .
12/10/23, 9:01 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for getting back to me, Natasha, and I apologize for the miss. The admission processing fee of $300 and the registration fee of $750 are distinct components of Galgotias University. Typically, international students are required to pay both the admission fee of $300 and the registration fee of $750 to secure their scholarship seat.

However, being an Edoofian comes with certain privileges under the Endowment Plan, one of which is an exemption from the admission processing fee. This means that you don't need to pay the $300 admission processing fee and only need to pay the $750 registration fee. I hope this clarifies the query you had?
12/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good Afternoon,LS Galgotias University internationally recognized
12/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 78 724 8051: ,Does*
12/10/23, 4:44 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I appreciate your perspective, Natasha, and thank you for sharing your thoughts with me about joining Lovely Professional University. I can certainly understand why you might have these thoughts, and if I were in your shoes, I might have similar questions. 

However, let me ask you this: Do you want to make an informed decision for your higher education, ensuring you choose the best university for your academic journey, or would you prefer to dismiss potential opportunities without thoroughly exploring them? What approach do you believe would be more prudent in this situation, Natasha?
12/10/23, 4:58 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Of course, Natasha. I understand your concerns, and it's essential to consider the recognition and reputation of the universities associated with Edoofa. All these universities, including Galgotias University, hold global rankings, and the degree you will earn upon completing your education will have international recognition as well. This recognition will open doors to global opportunities in your career.

As we continue our discussion on your offer letter, I will provide you with more insights into Galgotias University and explain the process of university recommendation and finalization. This will help address your query about how this part of the process works. I hope you are clear about this?
12/10/23, 5:46 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Okay
12/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Okay ,l have to explore those potential opportunities
15/10/23, 9:47 am - +267 78 427 538 started a call
15/10/23, 10:24 am - +267 78 427 538: A very good morning to you, if I remember very well u said u are offering Natasha Njini 100% scholarship now we hear that they are funds needed.please tell us how much all in all till they go so that we see if we are able to complete the process and again u are giving us short notice to pay. Wy I am saying this it's because we don't want to fail on the way thank u
17/10/23, 8:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Stephen,

I hope this message finds you well and in good spirits. I want to extend my apologies for not being able to reconnect with you over the past couple of days. We had some crucial meetings with two of our affiliated universities, MVN University and Lovely Professional University.
17/10/23, 8:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: These meetings were focused on discussing the endowment benefits for the 2024 academic year, and hence, they were unavoidable. Due to these unexpected commitments, we couldn't check your messages earlier, and we appreciate your patience during this time.
17/10/23, 8:31 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That being said, I am relieved and glad to inform you that we are now available to continue our discussion, and our focus can shift back to your admission process. If you and your family are available, I would like to inquire if we can reconnect and resume our conversation from where we left off?
18/10/23, 1:42 am - +263 71 994 1766: We can resume the discussions.
What is however everyone's worry in the family is whether we are finally going to meet the costs required for Natasha to study in India.
We have struggled to pay what we have paid so far.
May we know the outstanding costs for Natasha to successfully study in India.
18/10/23, 8:37 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for resuming our discussions. I completely understand the concerns about meeting the costs for Natasha's education in India. I want to assure you that we are here to help and provide all the necessary information.

To address your query about outstanding costs, we were in the process of discussing Natasha's offer letter from Galgotias University, and once we close the same conversation, the question you have on your mind will be addressed. Rest assured, we will do our best to provide a clear breakdown of the remaining expenses required for Natasha's successful studies in India.

On that note, before we continue with our discussion regarding your offer letter from Galgotias University, I have an update to share with you. May I know if you are available for the same?
18/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 71 994 1766: Let us wait for Natasha to be online
18/10/23, 10:48 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Certainly, Mr. Stephen, that would be perfectly fine. As you are aware, we recently held a meeting with MVN University, Gulzar Group of Institutes and Lovely Professional University. In light of this, I am pleased to share that we seized this opportunity to expedite Natasha's scholarship application with both universities, based on the recommendations from her counselor. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 10:49 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I am thrilled to inform you that our efforts have been successful. Both universities have accepted Natasha's application, and, notably, MVN University has offered her a 100% scholarship as promised to you early on during the counseling sessions. Below, you will find the offer letters for your review.
18/10/23, 10:49 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Once Natasha is online, please let me know so that we can reconnect to share further updates on this, discuss the offer letter in more detail, and provide guidance on selecting the best university for her higher education. Congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement!

18/10/23, 10:53 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. I hope Natasha is as excited as we are about these developments. I would like to inquire whether you were able to get an update from her and determine whether she had the opportunity to review the offer letters. It is essential to ensure she is informed and involved in this process as well.
19/10/23, 1:22 am - +263 71 994 1766: She could be load shedded.Her phone was not recheable
19/10/23, 12:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand and appreciate your understanding, @263719941766. If you could let me know a suitable time to connect with Natasha and your family, it would be greatly helpful in resuming our discussion?

Given the unexpected meetings and network challenges we've faced recently, our conversation has already been delayed and hence, I want to ensure that we stay on track and progress swiftly with the next steps in your admission process.
19/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 994 1766: It looks like Natasha is up to now not online because of load shedding
19/10/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 879 5693: There was a hailstorm which destroyed power lines
19/10/23, 10:37 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the information. We understand that sometimes unforeseen events like load shedding and hailstorms can affect access to electricity and the internet. Please convey our understanding to Natasha, and when the situation improves, we will be here to continue our discussion.
19/10/23, 10:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, it is important for you and your family to understand the next steps well, particularly the information about the offer letter and the associated due dates. it is crucial to adhere to these timelines, given that they affect the completion of Natasha's admission formalities.

Our goal is to initiate a detailed discussion on the offer letter as soon as possible so you can fully comprehend the admission process and make well-informed decisions regarding her education.
19/10/23, 10:43 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: In such a case, since the offer letter also holds a priority and Natasha is unavailable, what we can do is, if you as parents are available, we can connect with you in the evening to discuss the offer letter right here in the admission group. 

Then, whenever Natasha finds a better network and some time in her schedule, you can go through the discussion we had, understand the letter better, and catch up with us. This way, she won't be left behind, and she will be in a position to share er thoughts and ask any questions she might have. We can then reconnect with her on Tuesday to ensure we are all on the same page. What are your thoughts on this solution?
20/10/23, 6:36 am - +263 78 724 8051: Good morning, can we please get in touch at 2 o'clock  my phone was off
20/10/23, 8:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning to you as well Natasha,

I hope you're doing well. I am pleased to reconnect with you today; it has been a few days since our last conversation, and we were concerned as time has been passing, moving us closer to the due dates provided by the university.

I have taken note of the message you shared, Natasha. However, I am afraid that I will not be available at the same time, as I have prior commitments from 11:00 am to 7:00 pm. Therefore, I will be available to connect with you after 7:00 pm. Could you please confirm if you'll be available to connect with us at 7:30 pm so that I can adjust my schedule and connect with you accordingly?
20/10/23, 8:05 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Given the time difference between India and Zimbabwe, our operational hours are typically scheduled from 08:00 am to 04:00 pm CAT. However, we recognize that parents sometimes have work commitments or they are unavailable to connect due to network challenges during the day.

Therefore, we occasionally extend our availability and schedule operational hours in the evening to assist parents promptly. With that said, I am sure you understand that this might not be feasible every day.
20/10/23, 8:07 am - Vilsha Edoofa: For today, I can certainly accommodate and connect with your family in the evening at 7:30 PM. However, considering the time difference, it gets quite late, around 11:00 PM here in India. Therefore, we can only stretch our conversation for an hour or two. Since we are scheduling this discussion specifically for you and your family, and we had difficulty connecting in the last couple of days, could you please confirm if the network is stable and if you are actively available?
20/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 724 8051: Alright we will commence the discussion at 7:30
20/10/23, 11:17 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for confirming, @263787248051. We will proceed with the discussion at 7:30 PM India time. Please ensure that you and your family have a stable network connection and are actively available at that time. 

Looking forward to our discussion in the evening!
20/10/23, 8:41 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha,

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. In reference to our earlier conversation, I was awaiting a message from your end so that we can proceed with our evening discussion. Since we have not heard from you, I wanted to reach out and check if you are online and available for our conversation?
21/10/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening
22/10/23, 4:46 am - +263 78 724 8051: You may send the messages and once the network is stable ,l will go through those messages
26/10/23, 9:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening to the Parents and Natasha,

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I have gone through the message you shared and I would like to express my sincere apologies for the recent delay in our communications. Over the past few days, India has been celebrating a festive season, including significant cultural events such as Durga Puja and Dussehra. These occasions are marked by vibrant processions, traditional rituals, and joyful gatherings.
26/10/23, 9:03 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Due to these festivities, our communications were briefly interrupted. Now that we are back in regular operation, I would like to re-establish our discussions. I understand that our time zone differences have presented challenges in coordinating our conversations and making progress.
26/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Considering your request for sharing the messages you're requesting, I understand your desire for clarification. However, as our communication requires a more in-depth discussion, it might not be the right solution to provide the complete context solely through messages.
26/10/23, 9:05 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that in mind, I believe it would be more productive to *schedule a discussion for tomorrow morning at 08:00 am*. By specifying a particular time, you can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us. 

This discussion will offer an opportunity for me to provide a comprehensive understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, address any questions you may have, and offer guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.
26/10/23, 9:06 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Hence, for me to schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the scheduled time. Alternatively, if the proposed time is not suitable for you, kindly share your availability within the window from 08:00 am to 11:00 am, so we can arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.
26/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Good evening
26/10/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Alright,l will make myself available at 8:00
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Thank you for your response Natasha. I am glad to hear that you will be available tomorrow at 8 am. We look forward to our discussion and will be ready to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have. If you have any specific topics or questions you would like to address during our discussion tomorrow, feel free to share them here in your admission group overnight, and we will make sure to cover them tomorrow.
26/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Alright
28/10/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 724 8051: Greetings
02/11/23, 2:38 pm - +267 78 427 538: Greetings
03/11/23, 1:31 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Natasha,

I would like to extend my appreciation for your patience. I was occupied in a series of meetings with the university officials as we were concluding the admissions for the month of October. Unfortunately, this kept me from being available to connect with you.
03/11/23, 1:32 am - Vilsha Edoofa: I trust that you and your family are in good health. I have reviewed your previous message and I have also attended to the message you shared in our personal window. To move forward with our discussions, could you please let me know when would be a convenient time for us to reconnect today? This way, we can address any questions or concerns you may have and work towards the best way forward.
05/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Greetings,l will be available today at any given time
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - +267 78 427 538: Greetings

17/11/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Natasha, I was going through the conversation that you had with Ms. Vilsha where she shared a couple of offer letters with you here. However, you were not able to discuss that, can you please let me know what is the reason to that please, is there any concern or issue that you wish to share?
17/11/23, 10:33 pm - +263 78 724 8051: My network was poor so l didn't have enough information concerning the offer letters
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?
23/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 71 994 1766: Let us hear from Natasha.
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Sure, I would be happy to have her as part of the discussion. May I know by when can I expect her to connect with us here?

23/11/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please. On that note, may you please let me know how are you prepared for completing the registration process?
23/11/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 724 8051: We are  still trying to raise the funds <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 10:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: And by when do you think you would be able to raise hte required amount?
23/11/23, 10:40 pm - +263 78 724 8051: We will update you sir
23/11/23, 10:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know by when shall I expect your response on that Natasha, since it has been already around 2 months that we have received the offer letter and causing any much delay may lead you to lose the scholarship seat. I am sure that you don't want that to happen, right?
23/11/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Yes sir ,l think by next week we will be able to  pay the fee
23/11/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, may I know if you are certain about that please?

It's time for us to resume our discussion about the admission process and plan the next steps for your higher education journey. I trust you've been doing well since our last interaction.

May I know if we can continue with our conversation from where we left?
24/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Greetings,we can continue
24/11/23, 7:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, since you are certain about making the payment of the registration fee by next week, I want you to write a mail to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*" stating that you are planning to make the payment of $300 by 30th November and clear the whole fee and asking that if you plan to do that, would you still be able to secure the scholarship seat along with the Endowment Plan Benefits. I hope this is understood?
24/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok sir thank you
24/11/23, 7:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Once you are done writing the mail, please let me know.

24/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok sir,l really appreciate that
29/11/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Natasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
29/11/23, 10:35 am - Milan Edoofa: Following our last conversation, I had informed the academic board that you would be sharing the mail with them shortly, and they were waiting for your email regarding the confirmation of the payment plan as well as the date of making the payment. However, as it wasn't sent in a timely manner and considering the imminent closure for the current round of applications that will be taking place by tomorrow, I personally took the initiative to have a conversation with the team and university officials on your behalf.

After presenting strong cases and emphasizing the challenges you've encountered, they empathized with your situation. Understanding the circumstances, they have kindly granted an extension for the payment deadline up till 30th November. Hence, it's imperative to proceed with making the payment before the stipulated date. <This message was edited>
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Milan Edoofa: This extension was secured by showcasing our dedication and efforts on your behalf. It's essential to exhibit our goodwill and ensure that the commitment made on your behalf is upheld.

Please proceed with the payment as agreed upon before the extended deadline. Should you encounter any difficulties or need further assistance, feel free to connect with me at your earliest convenience.
30/11/23, 5:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Natasha!

06/12/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, you had mentioned about withdrawing from the program, may I know why is that?
06/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Because the deadlines are passing and l can see that my parents are having a financial burden
06/12/23, 4:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please help me in understanding more about the burden that you have mentioned here?
06/12/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 724 8051: I mean they have failed to raise the amount which is needed
06/12/23, 4:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask what is the reason to that, what were the challenges that they had faced? <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 724 8051: They had to pay my siblings' school fees ,making it difficult to pay my fee
06/12/23, 4:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Natasha, if they are facing that issue, then instead of withdrawing from the program, we can work on a solution to make sure that your higher education is well planned, right?
06/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok sir , l really appreciate that
06/12/23, 5:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, how do you think your parents would be comfortable in moving ahead with your admission process?
06/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Which solution have you come up with sir
06/12/23, 5:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Natasha, before we come to the solution, I wish to know more about how do your parents wish to move ahead?
06/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 724 8051: Ok sir,l will speak with them
