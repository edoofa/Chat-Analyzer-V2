I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024.

04/10/23, 2:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon. I hope you are doing well and blessed.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you earlier as it was the weekend, followed by a national holiday on Monday, which was Gandhi Jayanti. Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

Now that being said, I am happy to inform you that I am now available for the session. May I inquire if you are currently available to proceed further with the session?

With pride and anticipation, they embark on their higher education journey for the year of intake 2023. Their path is more than just academic; it's a profound journey of personal growth and the relentless pursuit of knowledge. This journey underscores our steadfast commitment to fostering a community where every Edoofian is not only educated but also honored with unwavering respect and care.

05/10/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your understanding. I completely comprehend the need to manage your workload and find the right time to commence the admission process. Starting on Monday works perfectly fine.

09/10/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending exams might pose challenges for your participation. I would like both you and your parents to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only your parents at times.
09/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 804 6308: So it is possible for me to start despite the coming examinations
09/10/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, it is possible and I will be getting you all the details soon. So, shall we proceed with the session.

09/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I am ready my only concern was that l did not want it to clash with my examinations causing some inconveniences
09/10/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright in the meantime we can proceed with your parents as well.  Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Microbiology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
09/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes it is correct

09/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I do remember
09/10/23, 4:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
09/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I get offer letters from different universities and after l have selected the university l want from the offer letters l would have received l  have to pay $750 which is paid in installments to reserve my seat at the university
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
09/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes we are
09/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
09/10/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
09/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Thank you, it is so good
09/10/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I am
09/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I'm very excited
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 5:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
09/10/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I have
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete her registration formalities, you will be presented with her Official Admission Letter with the help of which she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioningas a frontiersperson in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 804 6308: This is amazing very good
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes very much
09/10/23, 5:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
09/10/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Explain more
09/10/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Letter of Intent (Offer Letter):

When a university offers you a spot in their program, they send you a Letter of Intent, which is like an official offer letter.
Registration Fee:

This is a fee you have to pay to secure your spot at the university.
$150 Grant:

You're given a $150 discount or assistance to help reduce the registration fee.
Reducing Payable Registration Fee:

If the registration fee is $750 and you have a $150 grant, you only need to pay $600 yourself.
Adjustment Against University Fee:

After you pay the reduced fee of $600, the $750 total fee is still accounted for in your first-year university fee. The $150 grant is paid by Edoofa directly to the university on your behalf.
Seamless Adjustment:

Edoofa handles the $150 portion, making sure it reaches the university, so in the end, the total amount credited to your first-year university fee is still $750.
Final Explanation:

The explanation is saying that instead of paying the full $750 registration fee, you only need to pay $600 thanks to a $150 grant. Edoofa helps by paying the $150 directly to the university, making the total amount received by the university still $750 for your first-year fees.
Is there anything specific you'd like to ask or clarify further?
09/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I want to understand the difference between the $150 and let's say l have been given 90% for the scholarship
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing. You will still be granted the $150 that case as well.
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Okay now I understand
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
09/10/23, 5:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/10/23, 5:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I'm following
09/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Please provide
09/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/10/23, 5:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
09/10/23, 5:38 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I understand
09/10/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I am sorry if this causes any inconveniences but my study time is approaching
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear we can indeed proceed tomorrow.
09/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Thank you
10/10/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes we may
10/10/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes l am
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I am
10/10/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Okay, that is great
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Currently no

15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Isheanesu!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 10:06 am - +263 77 502 1778: Good morning . I am fine
15/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 502 1778: Isheanesu is not reachable maybe it's due to electricity at school
15/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Afternoon l would like to apologize for missing the session but I am now available.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, before we move ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
15/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes l went through it
15/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
15/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 78 804 6308: 1.900USD
2.3 years (6 semesters)
3.300USD
4.750USD
15/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
15/10/23, 10:22 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes
15/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
15/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/10/23, 10:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/10/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I'm following
15/10/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
15/10/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes we are
15/10/23, 10:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
15/10/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes I am aware
15/10/23, 10:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
15/10/23, 10:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
15/10/23, 10:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
15/10/23, 10:39 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/10/23, 10:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I am in Masvingo but my mother is in Kadoma
15/10/23, 10:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/10/23, 10:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/10/23, 10:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/10/23, 10:49 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Okay l will surely let my mother know
15/10/23, 10:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
15/10/23, 10:52 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes
15/10/23, 10:55 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I just would like to ask can my scholarship percentage change in case l have achieved something great in my extracurricular activities for example being recognized by the Environment Management Agency Of Zimbabwe and then I have the certificate
15/10/23, 10:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly! If you achieve something significant, such as recognition by the Environment Management Agency of Zimbabwe, the university may consider about reevaluating your scholarship. I hope this is clear?
15/10/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes
15/10/23, 11:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/10/23, 11:02 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Thank you
15/10/23, 11:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
15/10/23, 11:03 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Thank you
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes l am
16/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 804 6308: For now no but I will surely ask if I get any along the way
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

16/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 804 6308: My mother has a query because of the time frame that has been given to raise the registration fee because since I enrolled early with the program she would get enough time  to raise the money but the dates that have been given she says it might be impossible to raise such an amount
16/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Also is there way to use let's say my current earnings in the EWYL program to help with the registration fee

17/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 804 6308: She says the amount is too much given the time period due to her source of income currently not stable so is there a mechanism in the program that can help in these situations
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, I will surely help you with the same. For me to be able to do that, can you please let me know how much amount was your mother able to save till now for your registration please?

17/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Her phone is still off maybe it's still the electricity problem
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. On that note, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here regarding that.

20/10/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: What I meant to ask is, given that the admission process, including the Early Decision Benefits, is happening this month, have you made any preparations or plans to ensure that Isheanesu can take advantage of these benefits and complete the admission process on time?
20/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 804 6308: She said she knows about the Benefits but she might need some help since some unforseen circumstances have come up that is what she wanted to ask

26/10/23, 1:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
26/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. In that case, if you wish to wait till the coming year, to complete your admission process, then being the Senior Admission Officer here, I would advise you to not do that, since there are several reasons for that. 

1. You would firstly lose on the Endowment Program Benefits that you are getting here. 

2. By the coming year most of the students would have completed their admission processes already and in that case you might not get the same scholarship offers that you are getting now. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 1:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: 3. Moreover, over the past 5-6 years that I have been helping the students in completing their admissions, I have seen that untimely actions in securing the scholarship often leads the students into getting to a position where they lose out on the scholarship seats entirely as by the time they become ready, the seats are already filled in. 

I hope you would understand the same right?
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I understand mam but these are the circumstances l cannot control. I also wanted to ask if there was a you as a program would pay for the registration fee and then for the period my mother said she was going to pay she makes the payment to the program but I would still have the seat at the university
26/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I hope you understand what I am trying to say
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I completely understand your situation. Regarding your suggestion, it won't be possible for us to make the payment on your behalf, since we don't directly handle individual payments and it is against our policies, I hope you would understand that, right?
30/10/23, 10:30 pm - +263 78 804 6308: I understand mam
31/10/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Isheanesu!

02/11/23, 2:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263788046308  I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
02/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Sorry I did not really understand the question
02/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if you were able to go through this message of mine please?
02/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Due to the current financial status of my mother, l just have to wait for the results to come out
02/11/23, 8:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand the situation. Just to confirm, are you planning to wait for the results before making any further decisions about your university admission process?
02/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Yes mam
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for your response, Isheanesu. I understand that you plan to wait for your results before making further decisions. Please keep in mind that waiting for your results could potentially impact your scholarship offers and the availability of seats. Now, on that note, are you willing to let go of the benefits that you can have now?
02/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Let me try to discuss it further with my mother
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:29 am - +263 78 804 6308: Morning from 6  to 8  l usually have study sessions or a lesson with my teachers

07/11/23, 8:01 pm - +263 78 804 6308: 8 pm
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, shall we move ahead with our discussion now?
08/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 804 6308: Afternoon l apologize for not responding earlier my battery died and there was no electricity because of a thunderstorm
08/11/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Isheanesu!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 8:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. On that note, may I know if we can proceed with the discussion now?

I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Isheanesu!
