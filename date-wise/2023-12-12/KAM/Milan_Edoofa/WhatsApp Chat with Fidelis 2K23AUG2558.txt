*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.

07/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
12/09/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

15/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening sir how are you
15/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we are
15/09/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Geography) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
16/09/23, 1:19 am - +263 78 252 8840: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 7:39 am - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is
18/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening everyone
18/09/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Fidelis,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 252 8840: The weekend was good
18/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
19/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Fidelis!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
19/09/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 252 8840: No there are no challenges we may continue
19/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Sorry for not responding I was a bit tied so I slept early
19/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
20/09/23, 12:50 am - +263 78 252 8840: please my change the time, any time before 9pm can do it think that is the challenge
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening sir
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 252 8840: May we proceed
20/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/09/23, 8:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes continue
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we are
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
20/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes and then
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/09/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
21/09/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Fidelis.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening
21/09/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 252 8840: It is going well and you
21/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes sir we may
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 252 8840: No queries
21/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in November 2023. Considering the reasons you've provided and the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in November as agreed upon.
21/09/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
21/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
21/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok I will let you if there are changes and challenges
22/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Hallow everyone
22/09/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Noted
25/09/23, 2:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon sir
25/09/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I am ready
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
25/09/23, 3:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok you may continue
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
26/09/23, 2:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Fidelis!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Iam alright and how are you
26/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am well too. May I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Yes sir
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I have read and understood
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thank u
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Nice explanation
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Yaa I do understand
26/09/23, 3:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok ok I get it
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok iam the parent of fidelis
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have noted that as well, Mr. Shelton
26/09/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 3:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand
26/09/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 781 4433: This message was deleted
26/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do not agree with number 3
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Same as me as well. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Good one
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand
26/09/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I do understand  I always encourage the student to work extra hard and get it once and for all .
26/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 781 4433: I don't have any
26/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Fidelis's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Fidelis is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
26/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Iam sir 100 percent
26/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Fidelis's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
26/09/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thanks
26/09/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
26/09/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Ok sir
02/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon
14/10/23, 8:43 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Fidelis.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by PDM University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:44 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:44 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from PDM University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good afternoon sir I was just busy
14/10/23, 3:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, dear, may I know if we can move ahead with our discussion here now?
14/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we can
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
16/10/23, 4:35 am - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I have gone through it
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from PDM University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 252 8840: 1,. $1165
2. $1250
3. $750
16/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 252 8840: I'm sorry for late reply I was busy
17/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and FIdelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear. Now, Yes, as you can see, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1165 and your per annum accommodation fee is $1250 which makes your per annum educational fee $1165 +$1250 = $2415. I hope you are clear about this?
17/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes I understand
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now when we talk about accommodation at PDM University, for the first year, it is recommended that the students opt for the on-campus hostel as they are new to the place and the university is in a better position to assist them with their FRRO.

From the second year, when they are familiar with the place and have made a few friends if they wish, they can move out of the on-campus accommodation and look for accommodation options outside the university campus.
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: If you plan to stay outside the campus, your accommodation fee would be $1000 per annum and will have to be paid to the landlord of the place you stay. The average monthly rent would be $50 to $70 and the cost of food would be $20 to $30. 

This means, with the off-campus accommodation, your per annum cost would reduce to ($1165 + $1000) = $2165. Are you clear with this as well?
17/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is clear
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, now as you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure-

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Food Cost
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
6. Gymnasium Fee
7. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
17/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Ok thanks for that may we continue
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes
18/10/23, 2:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2165 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2165 - $1000 = $1165 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Understood it
18/10/23, 2:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself. Now, let us move forward to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter as well -

As informed, for the first year, the registration fee of $750 will be adjusted against your first year fee itself, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be as below -
18/10/23, 2:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. If you go with the *Off-campus accommodation*, only your tuition fee is to be paid to the university which means, your fee balance becomes $1165 - $750 = $415 and this will have to be paid in one part on your arrival. 

2. If you go with the *On-campus accommodation*, you will have to pay the tuition fee of $1165 and your accommodation fee of $1250, which means the total fee to be paid to the university is $2415 and after your registration fee has been adjusted, the balance will be $2415 - $750 = $1665 which can be paid in two installments of $832 & $833. (August 2024/January 2025)

I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page here as well?
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: Fidelis, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
18/10/23, 11:41 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes it is clear sir
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Excuse me for the same please. Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
19/10/23, 9:40 pm - +263 77 781 4433: Thanks
19/10/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now, before we move forward and conclude our conversation regarding your offer letter from PDM University, may I ask if you have any queries you would like to ask?
19/10/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 781 4433: So far I do not have
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: PDM University stands for Prabhu Dayal Memorial University and is located in Delhi, India. It is a relative university that got the status of a University after a very successful period as an Institution. 

The University status was allocated by the Government in the year 2016 and before that, it was an Institution. This university is located in the Metropolitan City in India with Access to metro connectivity. The University in a short span of 5 years has climbed many ladders and with its success, the Government has built a Metro station that connected the entire city through Metro Rail.

I hope you are doing well.

06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 07:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 07.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Good evening
07/11/23, 7:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion?
07/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 78 252 8840: Yes we can move on
07/11/23, 8:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Fidelis, earlier when we were connected with each other here, you had mentioned that the finances for the same are not balancing, moving ahead, can you please help me in understanding about what happened that caused these challenges for you?
07/11/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 252 8840: I don't know what happened exactly but that what father told me so I will ask him to answer you
07/11/23, 9:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you well here dear, were you able to discuss that with your father about the challenges that he is facing?

07/11/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: And by when do you think you would be able to share the same update with me here?

08/11/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Fidelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: On the basis of the discussion that we had here earlier yesterday, may I know if you were able to have a discussion with your parents about moving ahead with your admission process dear?

08/11/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Fidelis, can you please let me know of this as well?
08/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 252 8840: He just say he had a lot of expenses to pay for and he just said my son things are difficult this time around I don't know if will be able to pay for your admission fee
09/11/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and FIdelis!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/11/23, 1:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me here. On that note, can you please let me know if you were able to discuss with him more about how is it that he is going to proceed with your admission journey?
13/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 252 8840: This year I doubt maybe next year

I hope you are doing well today.
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, pleas Fidelis, I get that, however, in order for us to work towards the same, we would have to be on the same page, now, if you wish to do that in the coming year, I would like to mention that in that case, you would not be able to get any financial support in the form of the Endowment Benefits and Grant, now, don't you think that it will make the process even more burdenous for you?

May I know if everything is fine at your end and if you would be able to connect with me here today in order to continue with our discussions regarding your admission process as well as the next steps?
