Now that we are done with the forms, may I know if you are available so that we can continue with our discussion and I can help you understand the university admission process you will be undertaking?
07/09/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Yes we are available
07/09/23, 8:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
07/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Yes
07/09/23, 8:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 886 1991: You can explain further
07/09/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
07/09/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
07/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes they are clear
You may go on
07/09/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
07/09/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
07/09/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are following through
07/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
07/09/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - +263 77 886 1991: For far so good
07/09/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
07/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 886 1991: You may proceed
07/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
07/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
07/09/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
07/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 886 1991: You can go ahead
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
07/09/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
07/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 886 1991: I'll go through the videos tomorrow and thoroughly go through them
07/09/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
07/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Thank you
07/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ok thats fine!
07/09/23, 8:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Have a great night.
07/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Same to you!
08/09/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, With regard to our conversation, may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
08/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Goodevening maam
08/09/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess we managed to go through the four videos
08/09/23, 8:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great, so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
08/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Well all 4 focus on different areas 
The 1st focuses on what is generally expected from students which is to mainly follow instructions and to be open minded
The 2nd covers the key elements of Edoofa and the vision at large that consists of basically expanding one's capacity to hold success
The 3rd video is on the qualities or attributes of the schools that Edoofa works hand in hand with taking into consideration factors such as the accreditation, quality of staff, infrastructure, culture just to mention a few and lastly the 4th video covers statement of purpose that dwells on encompassing attitude, skills and knowledge whereby one has to relay their strengths, achievements, goals , vision in order to be considered amongst the respective universities
08/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
08/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
08/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
08/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess it was all clearly outlined
08/09/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
08/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ok, following
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Monday at 09.00 pm.
08/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

08/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect on Monday at 09.00 pm.

08/09/23, 9:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
10/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 886 1991: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, Thank you for submitting your SOP, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
11/09/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
11/09/23, 3:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a degree in the course Masters of Science in Biochemistry for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Goodafternoon
11/09/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 886 1991: yes that is correct
11/09/23, 3:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
11/09/23, 3:39 pm - +263 77 886 1991: yess we may proceed to that
11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
11/09/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
11/09/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 886 1991: it surely is not possible
11/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
11/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
11/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
11/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 886 1991: ok understood
11/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 886 1991: it was mentioned during the counseling sessions
11/09/23, 3:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
11/09/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 886 1991: yess we are
11/09/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
11/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 886 1991: i have taken note, you may proceed
11/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Noted
11/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Following
11/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example
11/09/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
11/09/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 886 1991: that sounds flexible
11/09/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Noted
11/09/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
11/09/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
11/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
11/09/23, 9:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
11/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 886 1991: No I don't but I'll have to comfirm from my parents
11/09/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the process now we start with the next step which I am sure you will be very excited to begin I was going through your EWYL Program Pledge form and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in September 2023, considering the reasons you've provided. With this in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL Program in September as agreed upon.

Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction and we shall reconnect tomorrow at 02.00 pm. I hope your parents will be available too.
11/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Noted
11/09/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ok we will
11/09/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night.
11/09/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Same to you!!
12/09/23, 8:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth.

12/09/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Is it possible to have the discussion tomorrow when network is better to help with the flow of the discussion
12/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I completely understand in that case, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
12/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ok thats fine

Thank you for understanding
13/09/23, 12:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
13/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Good afternoon
13/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
13/09/23, 12:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, Now I believe you have had a discussion with your family regarding your admission process, so I would like to know if you have any queries or concerns to share?
13/09/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Would you happen to have a rough idea of how much is incurred when covering visa fee, flight expenses and the other fee components that may be faced??
13/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Following
13/09/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, Let me help you understand. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself and for the Visa the cost would be $83, I hope you are clear now?
13/09/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Noted
13/09/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Go ahead
13/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
13/09/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Understood
13/09/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Proceed
13/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 292 5864: No we are not aware
13/09/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 292 5864: This won’t affect us cz my daughter is pursuing a higher degree (Masters) she has all her results sent to you
13/09/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed which gives us more benefit. So may I know if you are available to discuss to the Early decision benefits?
13/09/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Available
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Ok
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them. Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
13/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Clear
13/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Each year the universities revise their fee structure and it is highly possible that the fee would be increased for the academic year 2024. Over the past few years, we have seen a hike of 20%-30% in the tuition fee and to help our students from the same, students have been given the opportunity to keep their fee structure as per the current academic year of 2023.
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here, if you make the early decision to start with your university admission process and decide to reserve your seat with the university earlier, you will be able to get the above-mentioned early decision benefit and this would help you keep your fee structure the same for the complete course of your Master's education in India.
13/09/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even if the fee increases for your admission intake which is 2024, you would be protected against that and your fee will be in accordance with 2023. Are we on the same page here?
13/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Noted
13/09/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. Here, when you receive the Letter of Intent (Offer Letter) from the university, the registration fee would be mentioned, so by the grant of $150 means, if your registration fee is $750, then the actual registration fee that you have to pay will be only $600. 

Once the payment of $600 is made by you, the complete amount of $750 will be adjusted against your first-year university fee since we will be paying the $150 to the university on your behalf. Have you understood?
13/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Understood
13/09/23, 2:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. If your finances aren't prepared, and you need some time, in such cases, *Edoofa* is giving an option to make the payment of the Registration fee in 2 parts, the first part i.e. 50% of the registration fee after the grant of $150, has to be paid within the time period mentioned by the university and the second part i.e. the remaining 50% of the registration fee has to be paid within 30 days from the first deadline date. 

For example, if your deadline is 30th August 2023, and your registration fee after the grant is $600, then you have to pay $300 on or before 30th August 2023, and the remaining $300 has to be paid by 30th September 2023. Any queries so far?
13/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 886 1991: None as yet
13/09/23, 2:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 4 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 4 points clear?
13/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes they are clear
13/09/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like your parents to be active as well, for our discussion ahead so may I know by when will they be available to connect with us?
13/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Following sorry I’m at work
13/09/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if you have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
13/09/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Goodevening
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
My father was held up, im sure he'll respond when he can
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Connected
13/09/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Good evening
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
13/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 292 5864: All clear with us
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
13/09/23, 9:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess we do
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
13/09/23, 9:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
13/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes
13/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Since admission is only for next year is there an option of maybe doing the admission at a later stage or everything has to be finalised earlier??
13/09/23, 9:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, everything will be explained in detail as we move ahead step by step.
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ohh ok
13/09/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
13/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Please go ahead
13/09/23, 9:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 13th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 28th of September 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
14/09/23, 5:35 am - +263 77 886 1991: Yess its clear
14/09/23, 9:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, may I know if you are available to connect with us now since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
15/09/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ruth

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if you are facing any challenges?
15/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Evening out network is bad
15/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Can we do tomorrow at 9am CAt if possible
15/09/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand in that case, let us reconnect tomorrow at 10.00 am.
15/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 292 5864: Thank you
16/09/23, 9:46 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 886 1991: Goodmorning
16/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
16/09/23, 9:55 am - +263 77 886 1991: How are you?
16/09/23, 9:56 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if we shall start with our discussion now?
16/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we may
16/09/23, 10:07 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear here?
16/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 886 1991: Yes you made it clear
16/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 292 5864: Good morning
16/09/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 886 1991: 15 days to pay for the registration fee
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $600.
16/09/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

1. The first part ~ $300 is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, the deadline becomes the 01st of October, 2023)

2. The second part ~ $300 is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 16th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 01st of October 2023, making the second deadline the 01st of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
16/09/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are, you may proceed
16/09/23, 10:19 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
16/09/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 886 1991: Well from my understanding there is the early decision grants whereby one is eligible to a $150 of of the registration fee that is paid off after being offered an offer letter then there is the standard registration which also has to be paid within 15 days but unfortunately has no $150 grant
16/09/23, 10:27 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

Please let me know if you are clear on this?
16/09/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 886 1991: And also if you take the early decision benefit one is protected from increases in fees in the following academic years
16/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 886 1991: It is clear
16/09/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 292 5864: Bt early on the 150 was non conditional how come now this has changed
16/09/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, that is correct @263778861991
16/09/23, 10:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not understand your question well here, could you kindly elaborate your query?
16/09/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 292 5864: Point 3 does not hve conditions of early registration or late registration so how come now you hve changed
16/09/23, 10:45 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand if you read carefully this message, the 4 points are just brief this message for you to get an idea as to what the admission process holds, and certainly, we have explained in detail the two different admission processes the standard as well as the early decision process, please.
16/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 292 5864: It’s confusing now
16/09/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 292 5864: Our network is bad hence delays in response
16/09/23, 11:08 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that the network can be a challenge. However, could you please let me know what exactly is confusing so that I can help you understand better?
21/09/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 292 5864: Hie morning
21/09/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 292 5864: Our network has slightly improved can we resume our discussions

05/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
05/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the *tentative deadlines of *15th October* and *15th November*.
05/10/23, 3:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, If your parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned *tentative deadlines ( *15th of October and 15th of November*), they can give us the *go-ahead* so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
06/10/23, 5:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
18/10/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Its 2 years not 4

18/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different.

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/10/23, 9:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ruth!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 3:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with the discussion that we were having yesterday so that we can complete the same as soon as possible and make sure that the admission is completed in a timely manner.

19/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we may
19/10/23, 9:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 25th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 25th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 9:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *25th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 886 1991: This is 15 working days from when?
19/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: The 15 working days are counted from the day the offer letter is shared please. In your case it being the 25th of October. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 77 886 1991: But you had said there would be an official offer letter from the university
19/10/23, 10:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, on that, I am sure that you must have received it on your mail, right?
19/10/23, 10:24 pm - +263 77 886 1991: No I haven't
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Oh, that is alright please, I will ask the university officials to get it mailed again. For now, shall we proceed from here?
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 77 886 1991: You may proceed
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 10:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 886 1991: In Bulawayo
19/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 10:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/10/23, 11:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ruth!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:43 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion here. Now, may I know if you have taken a note of Mr. Rajan's details here so that we can proceed with our discussion?
20/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Goodmorning!!
20/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we can proceed
20/10/23, 12:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know. Now, Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
20/10/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess please
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Thank you!!
20/10/23, 8:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
20/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 886 1991: And opting for oncampus accommodation
20/10/23, 8:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the total costs would be:
20/10/23, 8:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800
Accommodation: $2000
Exam Fee: $200

Total: $4000

I hope you are clear?
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess I am
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
20/10/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yess it makes it better
20/10/23, 9:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/10/23, 9:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263778861991 Are we connected with each other here please?
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Yes we are
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 77 886 1991: No for now I have no queries
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
20/10/23, 9:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I would encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on the same tomorrow and also discuss the way forward for your admission process.
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 886 1991: Ok I'll discuss it with them
21/10/23, 8:32 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Ruth!

30/10/23, 7:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: I apologize for not responding to your message earlier. When you replied, it was outside of my working hours, and it happened to be the weekend, so our team was unavailable. Thank you for your patience.
30/10/23, 7:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you are absolutely, right. The deadline is calculated 15 days from the agreement of admission, and that agreement is the offer letter that is received from the side of the offer letter. This means that from the day you receive the offer letter, the deadline date is calculated. I hope this is clear?

06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ruth!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances.

07/11/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 886 1991: My parents currently have other pressing financial commitments so im not sure when they might be able to do so
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: And if I may ask, what are those financial commitments due to which your parents are not able to cater for your admission process?
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ruth!
I hope you're doing well.
