*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready for the session of your admission process. Shall we begin?
11/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Good evening
11/10/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Hope you are well

11/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Oky thank you
11/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 78 561 9278: We are done with it
11/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes they are
11/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Following
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/10/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Noted sure
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes they are clear ,, can you explain further the payment of registration fee
11/10/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
11/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 78 561 9278: It's ok I am available
11/10/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
11/10/23, 10:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

12/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
13/10/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Good evening
13/10/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Thank you
13/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Ok ias much as I understood it , students should be reachable and follow the given instructions they must be open minded also .In addition to that the vision of Edoofa is to get the students affordable and quality education and above all making them employable through the SEELS and increasing c capacity for success hence making students more responsible and independent. All the more Edoofa is well known by the colleges and universities for it's well instructed students and that's what they expect me to be also for me to be prepared and qualified. Also the Statement of purpose and the diligence in filling out the form is crucial and of paramount importance . By this the students will maximise scholarship percentage
13/10/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes we can i am now available
13/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
13/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
13/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
13/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
13/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes i am ,we can continue
13/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
13/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 11:00 AM.
13/10/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

14/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 561 9278: Question number 3

Business contribute much in economic growth . This is through employment creation , wide race base increasing GDP of a country etc as will be explained below 
First and foremost most , employment creation is one of the most important measure of economic growth. Once the economy's status is characterised by a large number of employment opportunities and a smaller of unemployment it means it is on its full potential and is growing futher. For example the economy of South Africa is believe to be more advanced than that of Zimbabwe due to its employment opportunities . Hence we can see the people of Zimbabwe running after it seeking for greener pastures
Also , business implementation is more like investing and inventi hence when a business is operating at a certain economy it ensures the wide variety of goods and services for the consumers hence leading to economic growth this ensures that if there is wide variety customers have room for making sound choices when maximising their utilities which also is important  in ensuring a high quality lifestyle which contrasts the economy characterised by few goods and services ,hence ensuring economic growth .
Moreso , the operation of a business in an economy is in favor of the country's Gross domestic product . this is because it increases exportation and also lead to favourable balance of trade , foreign currency is also earned through the same hence economic growth.
 Moreover , poverty is eliminated through the operation of a business in a certain economy this  hence will ensure economic growth as people will be earning income through bot permanent and part time jobs and even supplying the business with raw materials and other stuff needed.
Last but not least , the operation of the business increase the government tax base which can be used for govement intervention in the economy that ensures economic growth as  it will promote the production of public and merit good that have positive externalities to the economy hence economic growth 
For example through taxation to organisations ,the govement can raise funds needed to construct a dam or drill boreholes for the public and even setting traffic lights . 
In conclusion , the operation of the business in an economy must not be underestimated as it promotes economic growth through things like employment creation.
14/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 78 561 9278: Question number 4

In my life I used to wonder why I was being choose most to lead people of my age both in school work , church programs and even at general works . I come to pass when I learned of the qualities of a good   manager that I noticed why they consider me worth to be in charge in many cases .
Management is all about good planning , organising , staffing , coordinating , controlling and leading  . Once you are capable of holding and possess those functions we term you the best manager who ever lived.
   firstly, Starting by planning , a manager should be able to define goals for future performance and deciding the tasks and resources that are needed to attain the targets this will also serve as a function to give purpose to the organisation at large .
Secondly , organising which ensures the manager to assigning tasks grouping them and allocating resources to those subsections and even gaining the advantage of specialisation inorder to achieve organization's goals .
In addition to that controlling  which ensures monitoring activities keeping the organisation in track so that it keeps moving towards it's goals and taking corrective and appropriate actions as when it is required.
Further more leading which I believe that I possess  and am talented with judging from my life experiences and basing on my personal studies according to the way people treat me . Leading is more like commanding or getting people to do the things you or l as the manager want them to do . It can be in form of instructions or guiding but I enjoy it when I influence people so that they perform tasks inorder to fulfill the organization's goals. I still remember when I was working on Diamond Golden Age and on that time we were given a difficult task and people were now resisting to perform it due to its difficulty and the complicates in payment , but I understood better that performing the task and complain after duty was better than striking itself . So I just explained to my co-workers the benefits I understood of performing that such as the rights we will have to claim our wages after duty and even the experience of tackling that difficulty task that we will use in our lives when faced again with the same task , I explained  to the extend that they finally enjoyed performing the task that they were resisting to perform . This shows and explains my capabilities of my level of positive  influence to the staff inorder to fulfill the organization's goals which is is also a managerial tallent I was inherited by God.
14/10/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 561 9278: Question number 5

Human resource terminology is more about recognising human or work force as the most valuable resource among other organisational resources , people are believed to be a vital machines of an organisation. 
 Since this is important there is needy for the organisation to ensure that the Human resource department is effectively managed.
Human resource is important because no organization can function without it , even if we assume a modern day organization and say that it's characterised by machines computures and robotics that are made to make work easier , their functioning depends most on human resource for they need control . This will hence lead us to the fact that no organisation must underestimate the relevance of human resources . Also since human resource  is important there must be an effective human resource management to ensure that the former department will perform well . This will include both  management of stay and management of entry. 
If the organisation have got a weakness in it's  human resource department or let's say the staff is not well trained ,  not well developed,  not well compensated ,or not well motivated at large , the organization will suffer wholly  from the underperformance of it's staff this will even lead to business failure in many cases , so this insights us with the knowledge that human resource is important to an organization of any kind and should be taken as of Paramount importance inorder for the organisation to perform on its full potential. As we noticed that the Human resource is crucial to each and every firm or organization , it leads us to the conclusion that organisations must ensure suitability of potential workers  before recruiting ,them this is through interviewing  them , they must also train and develop them before assign  asks to them to increase productivity , and during the cause of operation they must make sure that the staff is well motivated to reduce high labour turnover which is not healthy for the organisation.

I hope you are having a fine weekend. May I know if you were able to fill out the form?
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Nice to know more about Dussehra
25/10/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I am available now
25/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
25/10/23, 9:36 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes i am available for that
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes its impossible
25/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 9:56 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes he made it clear also
25/10/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes and it sounds great
25/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
25/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
25/10/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I have
25/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
25/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Ok I cee
25/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we got to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon.

I will be concluding our session for the day and look forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow, starting from 3:00 PM. Additionally, I will also be available in the evening from 7:30 PM onward. In the meantime, I hope you have a wonderful evening, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Ok thanks for your counseling session
26/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope your day is off to a great start. I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it.
27/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Good evening
27/10/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Tanaka!

27/10/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the update with us; we shall work on that as well.
27/10/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 561 9278: It's ok no problem
30/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I am surely ready for it
30/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
30/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
30/10/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
30/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I have reviewed them
30/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/10/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 561 9278: That sounds great indeed
30/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
30/10/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
30/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I understood
30/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
30/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
30/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes , so it means if the fee is  500 it will be reduced to 350, I understood correctly
30/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct.
30/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Ok noted
30/10/23, 8:38 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Maybe we will continue tomorrowy battery is low
30/10/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. In that case, shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 2:00 PM?
30/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 561 9278: It will surely work
30/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Let us connect at the said time.
31/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I am ready now
31/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
31/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
31/10/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
31/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I am glad to know more about this endowment plan
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
31/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I already have my A level results already
31/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ah, yes, indeed you did. Please excuse me for the error here.
31/10/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I don't have any queries
31/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
31/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I am looking forward wholeheartedly
31/10/23, 4:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
31/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 561 9278: It's ok thanks you
31/10/23, 4:50 pm - +263 78 561 9278: So is this the end of today's session?
31/10/23, 5:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, Indeedd. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.

10/11/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Good afternoon we are currently facing some network challenges
14/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tanaka,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *MVN University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 6:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

14/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Good evening
14/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 977 6086: Thank you for sharing woth us such important news
14/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 977 6086: We are happy . We thank God for this
14/11/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 561 9278: There is no queries regarding the proposed time
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tanaka,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in discussing the offer letter. This delay might have led to missing out on this opportunity. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
17/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
17/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1250 - $1000 = $250, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
17/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
17/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 561 9278: This explains everything sure
17/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 561 9278: The program is beneficial indeed
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees.
17/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
17/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Which means $1000 is subtracted from the $ 1500 ?
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. Now,  hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1250, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
17/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
17/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes it's making sense
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Tanaka is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
17/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
17/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 561 9278: I agree with you on that
17/11/23, 3:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,500. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,500 - $1,000 = $500 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes I am aware of that
17/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Will there be any costs after the payment of 500, the last
17/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There will not be any other cost on the cost of education after that, please. Now, with that said and Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
17/11/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes You can explain it
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 561 9278: For clarity
17/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
17/11/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
17/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Yes we are in agreement
17/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
17/11/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
17/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 561 9278: In Chivhu in rural area
17/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 499 9965: Not in Harare, i stay in the Rural areas of chikomba district of Mashonaland east one of Zimbabwe's provinces
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 561 9278: Oky oky
17/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 561 9278: So can the student   manage to reduce the registration fee through the Earn While You Learn scholarship credits?
17/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is spot on and absolutely correct!
17/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now coming to the payment part. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
17/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi Mukuru for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 499 9965: Since we are in The remote area i think it's better to use the previous method through Mr Shorwi. I will inform you in time our plans
17/11/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Branch: Mutare

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week.

The payment for this registration is crucial for you to secure your seat at this university and the others to come are also secured by this payment. As your admission officer, I do not want you to lose out on this opportunity.  With that in mind, could you please update me on your current preparations regarding the payment for the first part of the registration fees?

This information will be helpful for me to update the university officials. Once provided, they'll anticipate the arrival of your next payment accordingly.

27/11/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for keeping me informed. I understand the circumstances you're navigating, and I appreciate your efforts to arrange the necessary funds for the registration fees. Given the situation, I'll ensure to communicate the specifics to the university officials. However, the date seems to be unfeasible as the university's application deadline closes on the 30th of this month. Could you let me know if you might be able to gather an amount of $100 by the 30th of November, before the month's end?

Hence, I will be able to convey that you were able to pay that amount and the remaining, and you will be able to retain this offer letter. <This message was edited>

We are in rural areas and most of our finance comes from farming but we are desperately in need of educated children. I need your advice so we can proceed. I am afraid that we might fail to get the needed money in time thereby failing to qualify after we have used the little that we get due to lack of knowledge and advice
