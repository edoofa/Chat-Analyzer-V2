21/11/23, 9:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents and Catney!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:20 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.

22/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student!.

I hope you're having a fine evening today. I am Mr. Shivjeet, your admission officer starting today. I would like to inform you that I will be taking over your session for the admission process, as Mr. Milan has been assigned to a new role as informed to you. I am pleased to let you know that he will be there upon your arrival in India to guide you through the university and you will be meeting him in person.

With that said our team has dedicated considerable time to refine and enhance your upcoming educational journey for 2025. We've honed in on an improved approach and I'm excited to share these insights with you. Let's delve into the details together tomorrow at 6:00 PM. In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

Financial Preparedness: The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

Reduced Financial Stress: Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

Avoiding Debt: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

Compound Interest: By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

Flexibility and Control: The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

Encouraging Responsibility: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

Adapting to Unexpected Changes: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

Peace of Mind: Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
22/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 027 1859: Thank you so much sir😊😊
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Thank u u are welcome
22/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Thank you
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Catney !

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With regard to my above message, I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Evening we are ready
23/11/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, could you please let me know if you were able to go through the above points that I shared with you the previous day?
23/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes l was able
23/11/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 027 1859: Good evening
23/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Good evening yes we were able
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Let me share with you how the Edoofa Secure Plan would work. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you are asked to pay is $350, right?
23/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Okay, so from the $350, you have already paid $200 and the balance $150 is due, right?
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes
23/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on our experience of over 14 years and after helping over 5000 students from different countries, what we have realized is financial planning is the most important factor when we think about higher education abroad. And to help the students and parents with that, the Edoofa Management has come up with a financially secure plan that will help you plan for your child’s higher education without stress and last-minute rush. Over the last 7 years, we have seen that 20-30% of students who take admission are unable to come to India because of lack of financial planning. The money required to book flights, and pay for accommodation and food after arrival is something that takes a toll and they are unable to send the child in that year and decide to defer the admission which creates a gap in education for the child. So, the Edoofa Secure Plan will reduce the financial pressure and smoothen the journey of sending your child to India.
23/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the month of November 2023 now and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for the finances. As you have been informed during the counseling session that we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees, the cost of education including the food, accommodation would be between $1200-$1800 and can even be less as well but not more, which means if you are able to save $150 per month for the next 20 months you will be able to save $3000 which is more than enough for the first year university fee which includes tuition fees (if any), food and accommodation. <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That means by the time your child will be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first year fee. Now, in these 20 months, I am sure the child will also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if the child secures to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years is already secured. Now, for a 3 year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 year, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent is easy and smooth. Do you agree to this?
23/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes we agree
23/11/23, 6:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, also, there is another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, mugging everyday. And in that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank requires a Nostro Account which means you have to pay to the bank to keep your money safe, right?
23/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes sir
23/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Yes
23/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Noted
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, the Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save the money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:
23/11/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
23/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Yes you can explain further
23/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Go ahead
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The reason is on the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will start to work on the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities so as to secure the scholarship and seat in the university. The earlier the seats are reserved, the higher the chances of securing a maximum quantum of scholarship, the higher the scholarship is the lesser the fee is and not only that, by securing the seat we are also entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university and not the new structure which will be implemented in January 2025. To continue, when we apply to the university, you will be given the letter of intent where the fee, scholarship and registration fee will be mentioned. As explained by the counselor during the enrollment, the registration fee is a part of the first-year university fee which is paid to reserve the seat in the university. It varies from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. Now, from the $1500 which is saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university to reserve the seat. For example, if the registration fee is $700, that means, Edoofa will pay $700 from the $1500 which you paid in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $800 which will again be paid to the university when you come to India. This becomes a great relief to the parent as they don’t have to pay anything immediately after the student comes to India. The $800 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year as it will be mentioned in the admission letter.
23/11/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: What do you think about it?
23/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 236 0162: Good idea
23/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 236 0276: I support that
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right?
23/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Ok ok that sounds good
23/11/23, 9:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose.  Have you understood?
23/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 236 0276: Yes yes
23/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session.
