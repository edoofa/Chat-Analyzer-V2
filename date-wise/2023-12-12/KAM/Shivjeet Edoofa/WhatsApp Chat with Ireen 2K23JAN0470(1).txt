He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

20/10/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Ireen.

I was not able to connect with you the previous day as there was unforeseen work that came up unexpectedly.  I understand that financial situations can be challenging, and it's important to make decisions that are in the best interest of your well-being and financial stability. If Imay what exactly happened in the past few days?
21/10/23, 6:32 am - +263 77 676 4848: In terms of our financial instability or

21/10/23, 8:00 am - +263 77 676 4848: We had many family functions which required money and now we have some children who are starting form 1 and the other one needs to register for form 4 next year so the money is nolonger balancing,like l said the ones who could have provided for the money are into buying and selling business and as are well aware about the Zimbabwean economy,we are nolonger able to sustain ourselves
21/10/23, 8:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this information. I appreciate your openness in discussing your family's current situation. I understand that you have immediate priorities, especially with your children starting school and other financial commitments.

21/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 676 4848: At the moment l cannot help but the least l can do is not to worsen the burden so as soon as l finish my A levelzl might apply in the police officer department so as to help with the finances

It's important to make decisions that are in the best interest of your family's well-being and financial stability. If I may ask, do you think it might be possible for you to secure a better position in the department shortly after completing your A-levels?
21/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 676 4848: The possibility is very low as many people here in Zimbabwe apply soon after completing A level so l don't even know what l will be doing till then
21/10/23, 11:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that quite well. In that case, may I suggest that, in order for you to secure a better position, you consider completing your graduation first and then go for the choice you have in mind?

21/10/23, 12:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I apologize if my previous message was unclear. What I meant to suggest is that you might consider completing your Graduation first and then applying for the police department position you have in mind. By completing your education first, you may have a stronger chance of securing a better position or advancing in your career in the future. <This message was edited>

21/10/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Are you referring to the graduation of attaining a degree
21/10/23, 1:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct.
21/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 676 4848: There is no money for me to continue with the graduation,l would have been so glad to pursue my degree
21/10/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that's where your EWYL program comes into play. May I know if you have been in touch with your EWYL mentor?
21/10/23, 1:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon as it is the weekend. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Okay
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Ireen !

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
25/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 676 4848: I'm free
25/10/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
25/10/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
25/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes clear
25/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
25/10/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
25/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes clear
25/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Can l attend the University even after 5 years
25/10/23, 5:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
25/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 676 4848: The money is still unaffordable by my family
25/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I can understand that we will be discussing this situation as well. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session?
25/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 676 4848: No I'm busy
25/10/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know when you might be available so that I can share the benefits awaiting you for Irene's higher education, which will be very helpful in terms of finances?
25/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 676 4848: I will be available tomorrow,any time of the day
25/10/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In that case, shall we connect tomorrow at 3:00 PM?
25/10/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes sure
25/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, we shall connect at the said time.
26/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Noted
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/10/23, 4:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 676 4848: No it doesn't
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/10/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/10/23, 4:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Nothing to inquire,l understood
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 676 4848: I would like you to provide me with more information
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Noted now
26/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 676 4848: I will only answer to this after discussion with my guardians
26/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed, you can do that. Let me share the understanding of the three points so that you can explain to your guardian with more information about them.
26/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/10/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 676 4848: It's clear
26/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Clear
26/10/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Don't understand
26/10/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, let me help you get this clear.


If you decide to stop your education by not taking exams or pursuing a diploma, there's a program called EWYL that will give you cash. The cash will be the same amount as the registration and enrollment fees you've already paid. Additionally, after one year in the program, you'll receive certificates for completing job-related projects. They will transfer the cash you earn to your bank account. So, if you choose to quit your education, this program will provide you with money and job-related certificates.

26/10/23, 6:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/10/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Yes please,help me

26/10/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that, dear. Now, all I would like you to kindly discuss this with your guardian and get back to me. So, may I know when you might be able to give me a solid reply?
26/10/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 676 4848: Next week
26/10/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well, in that case, shall we connect on this Monday at 3:00 PM?

If you have any questions or need further information during your discussion, don't hesitate to ask. Have a great conversation with your guardian, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
