Just a brief background of your student Mem.
20/10/23, 10:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772636611, Absolutely understandable and I can appreciate that some schools restrict students from using their phones or other electronic gadgets to help them focus on their academics. ZRP High School strongly believes in this approach, and therefore, we are patiently waiting for her and are indeed looking forward to connecting with Wilma once she is back home after her exams. Until then, we wish her all the best of luck.

At the same time, I am also glad to see that you are able to connect with us on your daughter's behalf. This ensures that she stays on track in her academic journey. <This message was edited>

21/10/23, 12:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 451 2698: We can proceed
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
21/10/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
21/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 451 2698: Following
21/10/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
21/10/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 451 2698: Yes very clear
21/10/23, 12:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
21/10/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
21/10/23, 12:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?

Thank you
21/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome. Now continuing with the last two steps-
21/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
21/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
21/10/23, 12:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
21/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 451 2698: Very clear
Thank you
21/10/23, 12:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
21/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 451 2698: Yes
21/10/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
21/10/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually.

23/10/23, 8:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Wilma, I hope you all had a great weekend. 

I am glad to know that you have completed all the videos and share some amazing insight with us. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
23/10/23, 8:57 am - +263 77 263 6611: Good morning wonderful team.
23/10/23, 8:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/10/23, 8:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones. <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 8:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/10/23, 8:57 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/10/23, 8:58 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 77 451 2698: Sure we agree

So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 10:00 AM.
23/10/23, 9:02 am - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.
