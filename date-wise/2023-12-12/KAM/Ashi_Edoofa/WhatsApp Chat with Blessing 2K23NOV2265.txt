07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Along with these forms, I believe Ms. Vilsha must have asked you to share your academic documents with us, and I wanted to acknowledge that you need to share them as well. 

Moving forward, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. Visit Your School: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. Provide Necessary Information: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. Printing and Signing: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. Include Authority Details: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
07/12/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
07/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 087 8756: as for now am not yet sure whether my school administrators are there since schools closed last week,so I will have to check with them first
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 087 8756: so ma'am does it mean that the statement of entry (A level) will no longer be required?
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 087 8756: which was said to be an alternative for the recommendation letter
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the above information with us Blessing, I can understand the situation however I would like to encourage you to contact with your school authorities regarding the letter of recommendation.

07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 087 8756: okay ma'am

Hence, can you let me know at what time will you like us to schedule our sessions on a daily basis (from 12:30 Pm to 08:30 PM)?

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
09/12/23, 6:02 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I am ready ma'am, let's start
09/12/23, 6:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 087 8756: I am done ma'am
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
09/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
09/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 78 087 8756: they are clear ma'am
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
09/12/23, 6:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
09/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 087 8756: am following ma'am
09/12/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
09/12/23, 6:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
09/12/23, 6:10 pm - +263 78 087 8756: yes ma'am
09/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
09/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: let's start ma'am
09/12/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
09/12/23, 6:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?

My first learning that l understood is that a student should be teachable and open minded.Secondly, a student should follow Edoofa 's instructions.
Moreover, Edoofa is also focused on increasing a student 's capacity for success, which means making us as students more responsible and independent and not only to us"students" affordable quality education
Furthermore, statement of Purpose is an important document,and students should be very careful in taking action and diligent in filling it out
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Blessing, that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
11/12/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

11/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *3. Please share your understanding about GAAP and it's importance.
*
GAAP is a set of guidelines that govern the preparation of financial statements.It is important for businesses to adhere to GAAP because it ensures that their financial statements are accurate and transparent.This allows investors, creditors and other stakeholders to make informed decisions about a company 's financial health.Stakeholders are individuals or companies that have an interest and are affected by a business ' actions.Furthermore, GAAP ensures that companies are operating ethically and in compliance with the law.Without GAAP,it would be difficult to compare the financial statements of different companies, making it difficult to assess their performance.
Beyond transparency and ethical behavior,GAAP also has a number of benefits or importances.It helps to promote consistency and comparability in financial reporting.GAAP promotes efficiency by allowing companies to use standardized financial statements, making it easier to share information with others.GAAP helps to protect the public by ensuring that companies are held accountable for their financial statements.GAAP plays a role in the tax code ,as some provisions of tax code are based on GAAP.Finally , GAAP is used in a variety of other settings such as when negotiating contracts
11/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *2 What is the relationship between entraprenuership and economic development?
*
Entrepreneurship is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a viable business.Risk taking, resourcefulness, creativity and willingness are required to put in hard work.Whereas economic development is the process of improving the quality of life for the community members by creating more jobs , increasing incomes and expanding the range of opportunities available to it's residents.It also focus on creating a more equitable and sustainable society.
There is a strong correlation between the two with entrepreneurship often viewed as a key driver of economic development.Entrepreneurship creates jobs,drives innovation,and generates income, all of which contribute to a country's economic growth.In turn, economic development creates an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurship, providing the necessary resources and infrastructure for business to thrive.
Another important factor is the role of government policy.Governments can create policies that support or hinder entrepreneurship and in turn , impact economic development.Policies that support entrepreneurs ,such as tax incentives or access to capital,can help to spur innovation and growth.
Therefore,l can say that entrepreneurship and economic development have a symbiotic relationship,they need each other to be successful

11/12/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *4.What are accounting standards and why are they mandatory?* 
 
 Accounting standards are the rules and regulations that govern the preparation of financial statements. These standards are developed by various standard-setting bodies, such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the United States.Accounting standards are mandatory is because they help to protect the public interest. Without standards, companies could potentially manipulate their financial information to make their performance look better than it really is. This could lead to investors and creditors making decisions based on false or misleading information. Additionally, if a company's financial statements are not prepared in accordance with standards, it could lead to unfair practices such as tax evasion. So, in a way, standards help to protect the public by ensuring that companies are following the rules and disclosing accurate information.  They ensure consistency and comparability in financial reporting. Without these standards, businesses could use different methods of reporting their financial information, making it difficult to compare and analyze the financial health of different companies. By requiring businesses to follow the same standards, accounting standards help to create a level playing field and promote transparency in the market.
11/12/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 087 8756: *5.Differentiate between Accounting and Auditing* 
 Although the two terms are often used interchangeably, they actually have distinct meanings. Accounting refers to the process of recording and reporting financial transactions, whereas auditing is the independent examination of those transactions and reports. In other words, accountants are responsible for preparing financial statements, while auditors are responsible for reviewing those statements and ensuring that they are accurate and in compliance with relevant standards. So, accounting is more of a bookkeeping function, while auditing is more of a quality control function.  So, the main purpose of accounting is to provide information that is useful in making economic decisions, while the main purpose of auditing is to provide assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatements. Accounting is also more forward-looking, as it focuses on future transactions and events, while auditing is more backward-looking, as it focuses on past transactions and events.Auditing uses a reasonable assurance standard, meaning that there is a high degree of confidence that the financial statements are accurate and complete. Auditing also goes a step further by looking for fraud and irregularities in the financial statements. <This message was edited>
