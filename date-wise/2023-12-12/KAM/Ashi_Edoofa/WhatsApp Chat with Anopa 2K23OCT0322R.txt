10/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Hie Ms Ashi..I'm Beatrice Anopa's sister. Thank you for enrolling my brother in the Edoofa scholarship.
10/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings All, You are welcome @263777702892.

I would like to inquire if you all are ready to proceed with our discussion. Your input and engagement are vital to the progress of our conversation.
10/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes we can proceed
10/10/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear from you. Before we proceed with our session, I would like to inquire whether Anopa is available to join us. It would be great to have him participate in our discussion.
10/10/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 770 2892: He is at school now and they are not allowed cellphones
10/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 770 2892: He will be in touch here and there so if possible we will give him the updates as we discuss.
10/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting us know, We appreciate that some schools restrict students from using their phones or other electronic gadgets to help them focus on their academics. Vuti High School strongly believes in this approach, and therefore, we are patiently waiting for him and are indeed looking forward to connecting with Anopa.

At the same time, I am also glad to see that you are able to connect with us on his behalf. This ensures that he stays on track in his academic journey.
10/10/23, 2:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To continue with our discussion, First I would like to know if you have gone through the above messages regarding the two Whatsapp Group?
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes I did and we are participating in both groups
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 770 2892: The most aspect which impressed me in Edoofa is the reduction in fees and it's affordability. You know here in Africa Zim to be specific it's not that easy to have a scholarship. And also to go and study abroad own your own is very expensive. So with Edoofa I think we can try and help Anopa.
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Also India is one of the countries that is good esp after completing the course, it can be easy to have a job globally.
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Another thing is we as Africans we are afraid of racism especially from other religions, but from my understanding and research I did. India is one of the safest countries to study.
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Just to mention a few.
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I appreciate your thoughts on Edoofa and the aspect that impressed you the most - the reduction in fees and its affordability. It's true that scholarships and affordable education options can be a game-changer, especially in regions like Africa where pursuing higher education abroad can be financially challenging.

India does indeed offer a diverse range of educational programs, and after completing a course there, the opportunities for global employment can be significant. India is known for its diverse and inclusive culture, and many international students find it a welcoming and safe place to study.
10/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you.

16/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 770 2892: I'm ready
16/10/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Firstly, Thank you for sharing the EWYL Document with us, we have duly noted the same. But as you must be aware that it has been six days since our initial discussion, and I am somewhat concerned because the admission session is scheduled to conclude in just four days, and we have already consumed more days than required. 

With respect to the same, you won't be able to start your EWYL Journey from 17th of October. Hence, it's advisable to write the new date as the next EWYL batch is starting from 20th of October. I hope you have taken a note of this information.

17/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
17/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
17/10/23, 2:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
17/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 448 2658: S.O.P.refers ....
17/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Ok l got it .go on Ms
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-

This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Ok  go on.

17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

17/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Ok Ms  Is it possible for us knowing the due dates for payment of the$500_$750 inorder to be prepared
17/10/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand your concern regarding the payment dates, However, I'd like to reassure you that there's no need for you to make any payments at this moment. Your next step will be to receive the offer letter, and only after you've selected the university where you'd like Anopa to attend will payment be necessary.  Kindly don't worry, we'll inform you about the same at the right time so that you have enough time to prepare your finances.
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Thank u Ms for a good  explanation

20/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 619 8691: (2) Soil fertility,how is it checked and how it can be improved?

Soil fertility refers to the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth.It can also be described as the ability of the soil to supply plant/crop nutrients in the right quantities and qualities over a sustained period of time.

A fertile soil contains the essential nutrients for example Nitrogen, Potassium and phosphorus which are required in Large quantities.

A fertile soil has got many characteristics for example a good soil depth for good root growth, good soil drainage for easy airation and penetration. It must have sufficient organic matter. It can be improved by adding organic matter, fertilizer, growing legumes crop like groundnuts which fixes nitrogen.No I farmer you must also grow cover crops that add organic matter to the soil and improves soil structure.

Soil fertility is checked by plant tissue analysis,soil testing and also visual symptoms of nutrients deficiency for example, shortage of Nitrogen leads to yellowing of the leaves. Stages for soil testing are Soil sampling, Soil analysis,soil interpretation and recommendations.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 619 8691: 3) What are the different farming system, where are they used and what are their uses ?

Farming system is the organization of the farm and all the enterprise in relation to each other. They are several types of farming system for example Extensive farming, Intensive farming,Small scale farming and Large scale farming.
Firstly,by small scale farming,this is the growing of crops and keeping of livestock on a small piece of land. It is done to meet the demands of the family food stuff. It is done in less developed areas or in  reserved areas. It can be called subsistence farming with little or no surplus for sale. 
Secondly,there is large scale farming. This can also be called commercial farming because there is growing of crops and rearing of animals on a large piece of land. The main reason is for sale. High quality products are produced and there is employment creation. It is done in more developed areas with the use of modern technology machines. 
Thirdly,there is extensive farming,which involves farming using very little input to produce the disired products. It is cheap on large scale. 
Lastly,there is also intensive farming,which involves the growing of crops and rearing of animals in a more supervised area for example plantation and paddocks or cattle ranching. It is expensive on large piece of land. There is also employment creation on large. 
In a nut shell ,there are also farming methods like mixed farming, inter croping, nomadic and shifting cultivation.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 619 8691: 4 )  
What are pesticide, explain the various types, their uses and their risks ? 
 _Answer_
A pesticide is a chemical control technique that is used to reduce spread of pest, disease and weeds. It can also be called agro-chemicals which are used to seek or restrict the spread of pests, disease and weeds or reduce their population in a given area. 
Types of pesticide are as follows,there are insecticide, herbicide, fungicide, rodenticide and to mention but a few. 
 Insecticide are those chemicals used to suppress the spread of pests and effects of pests on plants. Examples of pests that attack plants are locust, weevil and grass hopper. Examples of insecticide are
Herbicides are chemicals used to destroy weeds. This is called chemical weed control. Examples of herbicide are glyphosate , paraquat and diquate but they differ in methods of application. Types of weeds are pig-weed, black jack and couch grass. 
Advantages of using pesticide are,they improve crop yield by reducing competition with weed for physiological needs (water and sunlight),They enable farmers to get high quality products due to the absence of pests like maize stalk borra in maize, they also increase the shelf life of agriculture products,l and it is more effective than any other method of controlling weeds.
The risks incared with pesticide are,some are poisonous if consumed mistakenly. Some can cause skin disease and need good protective clothes like masks They are also expensive to buy hence reduce the capital which was supposed to be used for buying additional fertilizer and seeds. They need proper handling, storing and need understanding of the precautions and methods of application. They also make weeds and pests resistant due to prolonged and constant application of the same type.
20/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 619 8691: 5) How can technology assist farmers ?
 _Answer_
Technology is a collective term used to refer tools used to store , analyse data electronically. These machinery or gadgets include computers, cellphones,tv and internet. 
To farmers, technology assist them in different ways. It enable farmers to market their farm products through internet and whatsapp groups. It also enable them to increase productivity thus output per given input. This use of internet will help farmers to do effective market research on products on demand,new seeds and comparing prices. It is used to access customer and sellers through WhatsApp or tv. 
The use of conveyor belt during loading and offloading fertilizer will reduce labour force required which is called E- bay. Agric products like seeds and others are bought online through the website of the company (E-purchusing).It reduces transport cost and servers time. That is online billing. 
Workers in a farm can do online meetings and others can work while at home. They are also paid electronically using ecocash. 
Technology also servers time and paperwork since large volume of data is stored in computer for example number of fertilizer and seeds in warehouse. 
However,it requires large sums of money to fund the project. All electronic equipment require electricity for them to work while load shedding is at pick. Replacing labour by machinery can increase unemployment.

20/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 78 619 8691: Due to network problem the audio is taking long to send
20/10/23, 10:12 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. I can understand that the audio is taking a bit long, no issues let's the audio come in the meanwhile let's start our today's session.
20/10/23, 10:13 am - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on *Friday (20th of October).*
20/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 619 8691: proceed
20/10/23, 10:14 am - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Tuesday/Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents/guardian/sponsor need to do:

20/10/23, 10:16 am - +263 78 619 8691: l have joined the group
20/10/23, 10:16 am - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
20/10/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 619 8691: ok l will
20/10/23, 10:20 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are on the same page. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Sc (Agriculture)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
20/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 619 8691: yes it is accurate
20/10/23, 10:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
20/10/23, 10:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
20/10/23, 10:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
20/10/23, 10:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
20/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 619 8691: yes
20/10/23, 10:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/10/23, 10:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/10/23, 10:34 am - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 770 2892: Good morning everyone. I'm following thanks
20/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 448 2658: You are welcome
20/10/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Yes Ms we can go on
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
20/10/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
20/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Well understood Ms
20/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
20/10/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
20/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 448 2658: We thank you as a family
20/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263774482658. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
20/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
20/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
20/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Ok I will eargerly supporting the program
20/10/23, 2:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
20/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 448 2658: Sorry may u help ua on how the visa is obtained
20/10/23, 2:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly don't worry @263774482658, You will be assisted with the officer who will assist you in obtaining the visa, and the process will start before your arrival in India. May I know if there's any other concern?
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 448 2658: May be as we go on
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263774482658.
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/10/23, 2:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/10/23, 2:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 3:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263774482658 May I know if you have gone through the above messages?
20/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 448 2658: In meeting

23/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Hie Ms. Just a question when is the passport needed Anopa doesn't have a passport right now.
23/10/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anopa, Wishing you all a great day!

Regarding your concern about passport, we'll assist you and guide you when the passport is needed, kindly be assured. Moving forward, May I know if you are ready for today's session?
23/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes I'm there
23/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @~Bea..Mai Acky😘, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
23/10/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
23/10/23, 4:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Anopa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his seat before the competition even begins. He will be the trailblazer among peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
25/10/23, 8:52 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Anopa, I hope you are doing well. 

With regards to our last conversation, I noticed that our session was not completed, May I kindly know if you are available for the session now?
27/10/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 619 8691: hy

14/11/23, 8:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Anopa,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 8:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 12:00 PM.

14/11/23, 8:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 770 2892: This is wonderful news indeed. Thank you very much.
15/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 770 2892: I'm available now
15/11/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anopa,

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
15/11/23, 11:56 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes I have gone through but there is need of clarity and explanation esp on fees...tuition wat wat
15/11/23, 12:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Understood. Thank you
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263777702892. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 770 2892: 1. $1800usd
2.4 years...8 semesters
3. $300usd
4. $750usd
15/11/23, 1:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me correct you dear that your per semester tuition fees after scholarshipis $900, rest all the details are correct. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Oooh okay I get it. So this means every semester we have to pay $900
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct,  I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 770 2892: As of our we are opting for the cheapest since we dont have a sponsor and you know the salaries here in Zim
15/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 770 2892: So is there any possibility that there will be another university that may approve Anopa or we are on this one.
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777702892 We will discuss more regarding this soon, please be assured that your concern will be attended. I hope that's okay? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 770 2892: That's great.
15/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777702892 May I know if we are still connected?
15/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes Ms
15/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Heard this will be deducted on tution fee of the first semester. Is this true.
15/11/23, 4:58 pm - +263 77 770 2892: And also is there any payment plan like what we did on that $350
15/11/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263777702892. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes please
15/11/23, 5:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 5:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 8:05 am - +263 77 770 2892: Okay so if we paid this 750 how much is needed for the first semester. Is it 900-750.
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Anopa, Wishing you a Wonderful Day!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 770 2892: I'm good and you
16/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 770 2892: 👆
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263777702892 The registration fees of $750 will be reduced from your first's year tuition fees.
16/11/23, 1:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we start our today's session, I hope you have taken a note of these messages could you please confirm?
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes Ma'am
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 770 2892: No father is in Buhera Mutare Manicaland province
16/11/23, 2:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear,  you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
16/11/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Noted
16/11/23, 2:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 770 2892: It's okay thank you
16/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/11/23, 3:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263777702892 May I know if we are still connected please?
16/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Yes pliz
16/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 770 2892: I have understood everything
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/11/23, 4:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 770 2892: It's very good. So is it starting in the first semester
16/11/23, 4:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals. <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 5:00 pm - Ashi Edoofa: .
16/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 770 2892: Thank you if any question arise I will ask

16/11/23, 5:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.

A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.

16/11/23, 6:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your Anopa's letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
