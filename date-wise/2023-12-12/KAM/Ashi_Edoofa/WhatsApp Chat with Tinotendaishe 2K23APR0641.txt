25/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 667 6827: It’s alright then ,

25/09/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Confirm !

25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Noted
25/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since it is Monday. May I know if you are available to further proceed with the session?
25/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes Sir , I’m now available
25/09/23, 6:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I remember Sir .
25/09/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
25/09/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Okay 
So basically about the registration process , I understood that a registration fee is paid once you’re accepted by the university . Then after the fee is paid , the student will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter and the same will be used for securing admission as well as student VISA .
26/09/23, 2:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed. May I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 667 6827: How are you doing Sir .
26/09/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. May I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 4:32 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m ready Sir .
26/09/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
26/09/23, 4:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes Sir , we’re on the same page . 
We’re also excited as a family to hear such promising and wonderful information about the coming of the Offer Letters from Universities .
26/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience. <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: \
26/09/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
26/09/23, 6:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
26/09/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
27/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
27/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India. <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 4:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Well noted  , I understand
27/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
27/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
27/09/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yea it does resonate with me
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
27/09/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I’m following the details Sir
27/09/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 667 6827: I guess it will be wise if you provide a little bit more information on it
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
27/09/23, 4:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
27/09/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Now I have understood clearly , thank you so much .
27/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes
27/09/23, 5:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/09/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I agree
27/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 6:12 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m clear about it .
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
27/09/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
28/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m clear with that Sir .
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Sir ,
Yeah I’m doing good thanks and you !?
Noted Mr. Shivjeet
03/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Sir , 
Indeed it’s a very cheerful note .

Yes I’m available , you may proceed .
03/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
03/10/23, 4:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
03/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Well noted Sir but as we all know I don’t wish to go that path , I want pursue an academic path .
03/10/23, 4:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 667 6827: No Sir , for now I don’t have any queries .
03/10/23, 5:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving his offer letter?
03/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes Mr Shivjeet , I’m looking forward to them Sir
03/10/23, 5:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information. <This message was edited>

07/10/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 667 6827: Good morning Sir , 
Apologies for the late reply , my network has been down since morning .
07/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 667 6827: Yes , I had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly Sir . We’re really delighted as a family.
07/10/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Wonderful, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

2. The standard Duration of my course is 3 years ( 6 semesters ).
3. The Admission and Procedure Fee ( One-Time Payable ) is $300 .
4. The Registration fee is $750 .
07/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 667 6827: My network is down Sir , I’m sorry.
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you here earlier, since I got occupied in an urgent meeting. I appreciate your patience here.
09/10/23, 7:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great, let's delve deeper. Now, you're enrolled in a course that stretches across three years. This academic journey is divided into 6 semesters. With your scholarship, your tuition fee stands at $900 per semester. When calculated annually, it amounts to $1800. Is this clear and straightforward?
09/10/23, 7:30 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Evening Sir , how are you ?
Yes I’m doing well thanks .
09/10/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 667 6827: It’s alright Sir
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine too dear, thank you for asking. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
09/10/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
09/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Well noted Sir , it’s clear
09/10/23, 7:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
09/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes we’re together
09/10/23, 7:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 667 6827: May you please give me a brief on the examination fee issue .
10/10/23, 1:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/10/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask what is it that you wish to know about the same dear?
10/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Sir , how are you doing ?
10/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 667 6827: I would wish to know that the money is for which examination . Is it for the examination we write at the end of the semester or …. ?
10/10/23, 9:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. Regarding the examination fee mentioned in your offer letter, it is for the examinations that you will be taking at the end of each semester. In most universities, students are required to pay an examination fee for each semester to cover the cost of conducting the exams, grading, and related administrative expenses. So, in your case, the $100 examination fee is for the end-of-semester examinations. I hope this is clear now?
10/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah it’s now clear Sir , thank you .
10/10/23, 9:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
10/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes we’re good so far .
11/10/23, 11:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
14/10/23, 7:52 am - +263 77 667 6827: Morning Sir , 
I hope you had a great night .
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier. May I know if we can move ahead with our conversation here so that we can plan the next steps in your admission journey?
16/10/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 667 6827: How are you doing Sir , 
Yes we can move on with our conversation . I was in an exam today so I wasn’t available .
16/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I’m clear Sir .
16/10/23, 2:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 20th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 20th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 2:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *20th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah we’re on the same page Sir .
16/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I reside in Harare .
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
16/10/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
16/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Noted Sir , Thank you so much
17/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes you may Sir share them again
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
17/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Well noted Mr Milan
17/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, For your ease, let me also help you by summarizing all the fee components that we discussed and sharing the cost of education you as a family are supposed to incur at Galgotias University -

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1800 + $200 + $800 = $2800
17/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Okay
17/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 667 6827: What about with the cost of living within the campus
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: In that case, the total costs would be $1800 + $200 + $2000 = $4000 per annum. Is that clear?
18/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah that’s clear
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 9:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m clear on that Sir
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $2800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $2800 - $1000 = $1800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.	
	
With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
19/10/23, 3:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today. <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263776676827 I was expecting a response from your side on this message of mine please. Now, can you please let me know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead wiht our discussion?
19/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Mr Milan , how are you doing !?
Yes we’re doing well Sir .
19/10/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I’m clear on that .
19/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is good to know we are on the same page and I hope you will be working hard in the EWYL Program to reduce your cost of education, your mentors would indeed guide you in the right direction so that you can achieve all the targets you set for yourself.

Now, Do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 667 6827: I don’t have any queries for now Sir .
19/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
19/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is located in Delhi NCR and is ranked in the top 100 Universities in India. It has also set the highest benchmark towards Academic Excellence NAAC A+ Accreditation in First Cycle.

The 'students-first' philosophy is a big reason why Galgotias University is consistently ranked among India's top universities and is one of the associated universities of Edoofa.

The focus of Galgotias University is on the low student-to-faculty ratio that promotes plenty of personal attention and mentoring opportunities for its students.

You can visit the university's website using this link and see the accreditations and approvals from the government of India - https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, on this link here: https://galgotiacollege.edu/infrastructure-virtual-tour

20/10/23, 12:58 am - +263 77 667 6827: Morning Sir , 
How are you doing today ?
20/10/23, 2:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
20/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Sir , 
Yes we’re happy and also we had the chance to discuss about the offer letter but we thought we were suppose to receive different offer letters from different universities as we were told by the Edoofa team so that we could compare and choose from one of them .
20/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
20/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m clear on that .
20/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
20/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes I’m now clear Sir .
20/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 667 6827: I also have another question Sir if you don’t mind .
20/10/23, 5:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, but first let us clear this one here. Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
20/10/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 667 6827: No Sir , may you please explain about the transfer option .
20/10/23, 5:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
20/10/23, 5:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
22/10/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yeah I’m clear and I now have a better understanding
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:16 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you are clear about the same. Now, that you have proper clarity on the subject, shall we move ahead with our discusssion here please?
23/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 667 6827: Morning Sir , how are you doing !?
23/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 667 6827: Yes we may move on but I still have a pending question Sir
23/10/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, what is that pending question?
23/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 667 6827: Okay , so let’s say suppose you realize that you made a mistake on taking a career path and you want to change the program you want to do . Let’s say it this way , I was offered Engineering , Medicine and B.Com when I started this program …. So considering my subjects I’m doing on my A level , I found it easier for me to do a degree program like Engineering and it will be difficult for me to start up a commercially based degree program . So what am I suppose to do for me to get back into the Engineering program with Edoofa .
May you please kindly assist me on this Sir . Thank you so much .
23/10/23, 12:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, if I am getting you right, then you are planning to do the Engineering course for your higher education as of now, right?
23/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes Sir , suppose I want to do that …. is it possible and what am I suppose to do , what’s the procedure to follow like ?
23/10/23, 12:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, can you please let me know of the reason why is it that you wish to pursue an Engineering course dear?
23/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 667 6827: I have always wanted to pursue that career Sir and also the subjects I’m doing right now at A level are Engineering course related Sir . I’m doing Mathematics , Physics and Chemistry so it will be difficult for me to do a commercially related program . I feel like I can do the best in Engineering course Sir .
23/10/23, 12:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, can you please also let me know of the reason that you chose to pursue the B.Com course for your higher education earlier?
23/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Okay , so I wanted to do the actuarial Science program at first and I thought maybe I could do B.Com first so I was wrong Sir .
23/10/23, 1:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Tinotendaishe, can you please also let me know of the reason that you think you are wrong in pursuing the B.Com course please?
23/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Actually it’s not that I think I’m wrong but the issue with my subjects I’m currently doing , it’s very difficult for me to start doing the Business studies , Economics , Accounting etc ….. it will be hard for me to copy up with the other students already doing these subjects at A level . Also I discovered that I’m more into Engineering myself and since I was offered it at first I thought it would still be possible for me to pursue that lovely career with you guys .
23/10/23, 1:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if I may ask are you willing to let go of your plan to study Actuarial Science and transit into the field of Engineering?
23/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Yes Mr Milan , now may you please assist me .
24/10/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 667 6827: Afternoon Sir
25/10/23, 5:34 am - +263 77 667 6827: Thank you so much Sir
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tinotendaishe!
I hope you are having a good day.

Our scheduled session is today at 12:30 AM CAT to continue our discussion about your admission process. I'm reaching out to confirm if you're ready to begin the session as planned. Please let me know if you're available, and we can get started?
