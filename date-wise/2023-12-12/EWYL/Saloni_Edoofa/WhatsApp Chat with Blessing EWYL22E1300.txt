16/09/23, 10:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:25 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Saturday* from *08:00 AM - 09:30 AM* from next week onwards⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
16/09/23, 10:50 am - +27 82 349 8192: All noted ..you can proceed with the sessions with me ,Blessing will not be available until November
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day! I hope you're doing well.

I wanted to inform you that due to the _organization being closed this Saturday_, our next session will be rescheduled to the following week, specifically on *Wednesday, September 27, 2023* _12:00-01:00 PM_. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

In the meantime, I'd like to share my brief introduction video with you, which will provide some insight into who I am. Additionally, I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you see the video, do let me know how you find it and of course, pick out your best section from the newsletter. Excited to hear that out!
21/09/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 12:42 pm - +27 82 349 8192: Good day in India hope everyone is well ..I have had an opportunity to read the newsletter ,it has so much inspiration and motivational lines..

But as I had stated before ,your student is busy with his final exams and as soon as he is available he will make contact and give answers as I believe these newsletters are specifically intended for them to have wisdom in their journey of education..

Thank you ..

And if I may ask ,if possible please reschedule the contact sessions with me to Thursday afternoon (CAT) because that's the day I can give full attention..

Wednesday afternoon I am fully occupied with work and it will be impossible for me to answer you on time ,I can only respond latter inthe evening..

Thank you so much ,your help inthis regard will be greatly appreciated and I again just an emphasis this is Blessing's father..

Blessing will only be available mid November

30/09/23, 8:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Blessing will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

06/10/23, 1:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I appreciate your response and I would also recommend that you add someone else from the family to the group since you talked about your unavailability and who could attend the session on your behalf on Saturdays to complete this Fastrack process.

07/10/23, 8:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
07/10/23, 8:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Blessing can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?

07/10/23, 8:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
07/10/23, 8:25 am - +27 82 349 8192: Noted
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
07/10/23, 8:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
07/10/23, 8:31 am - +27 82 349 8192: Can we wait for Blessing to be available and then continue with these sessions??
07/10/23, 8:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, we will not start with the sessions but these are some basic formalities that need to be completed.
07/10/23, 8:38 am - +27 82 349 8192: Okey .will read through again but for now I am in a work meeting so I will respond latter
