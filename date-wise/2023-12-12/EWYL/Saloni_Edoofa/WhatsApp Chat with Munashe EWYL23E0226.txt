I hope you're having a wonderful day.

I wanted to express how genuinely intrigued and excited I am after our Wednesday lesson. It was not just interesting but also incredibly amusing. As I delved into the material, I couldn't help but ponder my own hidden talents and how I might use them to bring smiles and magic into the lives of others. It's a thought that has been lingering in my mind ever since.

Now, I'm very curious about your talents, those unique gifts that undoubtedly define who you are. I'm eagerly anticipating hearing about them because I'm sure they're something special.

Afterward, let's also dive into the exciting world of projects on the *EWYL Line only*
01/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 805 1364: Good afternoon Ms Saloni.

 I am glad you enjoyed and even discovered your hidden talents that bring smiles to people.
02/09/23, 1:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
08/09/23, 12:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

 There are some important quotes l found mesmerizing and motivating to students like us..

"Don’t worry about being successful but work toward being significant and
success will naturally follow. – Oprah Winfrey 

Most students like us wish to be successful. We can even plan out our goals and future activities. However the problem comes when we want to be success but don't work hard at all. Every goal in life needs a little push for it to work . Hard work is what some of us lack. Thus one needs self motivation and working hard inorder to achieve our dreams and become successful.

"As a founder, lay all the possible scenarios – from best to worst – in front of
you, so you don’t get surprised when something happens." – Brian Wong

Most of us tend to panick when things don't go our ways. When we face the unexpected we tend to give up so easily that after analyzing without fear you discover that there was nothing much to fear . Instead of preparing for the unexpected we tend to give up without giving ourselves a chance to do it again .

"Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a
long time ago." – Warren Buffet

Some of the things we do and the roads we take are already paved by people long back. Some of us have our parents' support which is the reason why we can go to school. Even the technology we now use is because of people like Elon mask and companies like Huawei , iphones companies now produce gadgets like cell phones that makes communication easy world wide .

In life our dreams push us to work hard so we can achieve them. It's not all about money that limit us from achieving what we want but our ideas and goes can generate money themselves. <This message was edited>

I trust this message finds you well.

I'm genuinely excited about our upcoming sessions scheduled for Monday from 09:30 AM to 11:00 AM. As we gear up for today's session on the EWYL Line, I've been giving some thought to ways we can enhance our engagement and involve your parents in the process.

After careful consideration, we've decided to shift our sessions to the *EWYL Group starting tomorrow*. This change not only allows us to keep your parents in the loop but also it will also remove the dependency on your following the daily ritual on the EWYL Line.

Starting *tomorrow*, our sessions will be held from *09:00 AM to 10:00 AM, Monday to Friday*, on the *EWYL Group*. This adjustment aims to streamline communication and ensure everyone is on the same page. I'd appreciate it if you could acknowledge this change to confirm your understanding.

I look forward to our continued collaboration!

So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Munashe!

May we begin with our session?
22/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 805 1364: Community building has a goal to promote social interaction and participating so as to achieve success. 

Community building makes students spread Edoofian news through different social networks . 
It is for Edoofian students to  reach out to other students who finished senior school to join Edoofian for their further studies.

Edoofian students will be paid according to the students they join Edoofian
22/11/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 805 1364: Good morning Ms Saloni...indeed we may begin
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Munashe, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
22/11/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
22/11/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 805 1364: Well received Ms Saloni

22/11/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
22/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 805 1364: Noted Ms saloni
22/11/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/11/23, 9:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Munashe/Saloni/22NOV2023*
22/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 805 1364: Alright Ms saloni I will do that
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/11/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
22/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 805 1364: Noted Ms Saloni
22/11/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood this process Munashe?
22/11/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 805 1364: Yes Ms Saloni l have understood
22/11/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: I see you have already formed a group, may I know how many members are there in the group?
22/11/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 805 1364: There used to be 30 but l removed most of them due to not participating . I will look for others who are interested
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them to your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.
22/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 77 805 1364: I am only left with 15
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2. Once they come to your INBOX, share information about Edoofa with them except for the application form.

3. Afterwards, if they ask for the application form, ask them to share the link of your WhatsApp group with 10 other groups and them share a screenshot with you once they have done that.

4. After they have done it, share the application form with them.
22/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 805 1364: Noted Ms Saloni l will do that
22/11/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: So for community building:
1) Keep the group updated DAILY.
2) Try reaching out to students from different schools 
3) Try reaching out to teachers from your school or others and ask them to share the link to your WhatsApp group with other school teachers from different schools
4) In the group just:
-please give 'only admins' access
-just ask the students/participants to DM you to know about Edoofa and to get the form
-once they DM you, share about Edoofa with them
-Before sharing the form, ask them to get you added to their school groups
-once they do that, then only share the form with them.​
​5) Use social media as your sword to tell people about Edoofa
6) Use Facebook groups, I am sharing a screenshot that will help you understand that there are various scholarship groups on Facebook that you can join and share information about Edoofa also forward the link to your WhatsApp group there.

23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
23/11/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
23/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 805 1364: Noted Ms Saloni
23/11/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you do this let me know.
