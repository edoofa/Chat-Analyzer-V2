The main of this community building left how to operate social media and to acquire international education. This project helps to opportunities in terms of jobs.

02/08/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 122 9669: Okay thank you noted
02/08/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 122 9669: So what needs to be done from here
02/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
02/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I will tell you once you understand this.
02/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 122 9669: Oky this one I understand very well
02/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Rodwell/Saloni/2AUGUST2023*
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Read it carefully
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
02/08/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
02/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Basically when should I create the group
03/08/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 898 7559: Good afternoon today I won't be able to connect with you because I'm travelling to somewhere so I might face network challenges... Thank you...
04/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Good afternoon shall we start the session
04/08/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing?

Please excuse me for not reaching out to you yesterday. I was occupied in a meeting that required my immediate attention, I sincerely apologize for that.
May we begin now?
04/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 898 7559: I'm doing great thank you and you
04/08/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 898 7559: It's ok  no problem let's begin the session

04/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That's awesome Rodwell!
04/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, let me share some information with you that will help you in networking further. I call this information - RESOURCES
04/08/23, 1:53 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Oky thank you let's proceed
04/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
04/08/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Province its Matebeland
17/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I see that your school is already connected with Edoofa.

 TODAY, I would like you to connect with other School Heads. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all other fellow school students as well.
17/08/23, 2:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
17/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Right now I don't have one but I will try to find school head's numbers

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
18/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 898 7559: I understand very well

21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, we are ready to begin a new journey!
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/08/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Okay I get it
21/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 898 7559: Okay

Hope you are doing well, I would like to announce that today is a holiday on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan which is an auspicious Indian Festival so I am sharing the lesson with you today!

So for this week's Wednesday lesson, I have an exciting topic to delve into: Hidden Talent.
We'll dive into the captivating story of Samuel, a character whose seemingly ordinary life takes a fascinating turn when his secret talent comes to light. Through his story, we'll discover the power of talents that lie beneath the surface, waiting for the perfect moment to shine.
So, bring your curiosity and imagination as we delve into Samuel's tale and discuss the significance of hidden talents in our own lives. You might even find yourself reflecting on your own unique abilities that are yet to be revealed.

In our upcoming session I would like to know if you have a hidden talent that you're particularly good at or passionate about? It could be anything – from artistic pursuits to something more unexpected.

Get ready to be inspired, and let's embark on this journey of self-discovery together!
