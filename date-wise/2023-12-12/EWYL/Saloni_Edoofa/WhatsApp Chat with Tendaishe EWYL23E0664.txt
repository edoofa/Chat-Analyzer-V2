How are you doing?
26/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, no worries at all.
26/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
26/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 632 7102: Yes that's fine pleased to speak with you as well
26/09/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Even I am super delighted to have you!
26/09/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
26/09/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 632 7102: I'm Tendaishe's mother unfortunately he's at school now he'll be online when he's free
26/09/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I can understand that.
26/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 632 7102: Ok
26/09/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
26/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 632 7102: No may you please walk me through them
26/09/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
26/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 632 7102: Okay
26/09/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
26/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 632 7102: Understood
26/09/23, 9:17 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
26/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 632 7102: Okay
26/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 128 5721: Noted
26/09/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
26/09/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
26/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 128 5721: Nice to know you Mam🤝
26/09/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
26/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 128 5721: Hope will continue progressing with more excitement until the end of our program thank you Mam we are glad too

26/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 632 7102: You are welcome
27/09/23, 8:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
27/09/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 128 5721: yes we can start
27/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/09/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.

28/09/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 128 5721: Understandable

28/09/23, 8:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest. <This message was edited>
28/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 128 5721: Edoofa Hall of Aspiration
28/09/23, 8:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Indeed it is a section worth the attention!
28/09/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 128 5721: Yess
28/09/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Tendaishe?
28/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 128 5721: It sounds great especially the second one
28/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is also my favorite part to see students earning.
28/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from so far discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
28/09/23, 8:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
28/09/23, 8:48 am - +263 78 128 5721: You can ask Mam
28/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.

Ms. Sanjana the Head of the department. Ms. Davi, Head coach
28/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 128 5721: first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers.
28/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 128 5721: second goal is to help all edoofians self-finance their education,
28/09/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is great Tendaishe!

You are just left with last two...
28/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 128 5721: Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians through newsletters
28/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 128 5721: This message was deleted
28/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 128 5721: But i think its the importances of attending seminars during education

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?

Mahatma Gandhi, whose full name was Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, was one of the most prominent leaders of the Indian independence movement against British colonial rule. Gandhi's life and work left an indelible mark on not only India but also the world, as he advocated for nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving social and political change.

16/10/23, 8:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
16/10/23, 8:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
16/10/23, 8:29 am - +263 78 128 5721: I get it
