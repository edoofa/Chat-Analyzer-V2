I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

19/09/23, 1:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Ethan's EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Ethan? <This message was edited>

22/09/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Ethan will be a part of.

03/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 267 1786: The weekend went well.
And how was yours too?
03/10/23, 12:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It was good, thank you.
03/10/23, 12:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Ethan  can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 267 1786: Yes we are
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
03/10/23, 12:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

07/12/23, 10:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, go on, I am ready to hear more!
07/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 019 2260: So the first project is entitled corporate Aliances and this is focusing more on how to persuade and engage into companies to sign contracts with .This will start by researching about the company and then we go on a step further to knock at their social media platforms or go directly to their offices where we will share or line of thinking and if they agree we will then direct them to you .
07/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 019 2260: The second project is entitled Community building. 
This project is for us to plan and see how we can persuade our other colleagues to join this Edoofa program.
Therefore we're to start by sharing our ideas first to our friends, cousins and relatives .
07/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 019 2260: The third one which is the last one was focusing more on how we can approach schools which are in our communities and share this vision to them also .

07/12/23, 10:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
07/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 019 2260: OK .
I learnt that the Corporate Aliance project is a wonderful project to do because you will gain a lot of skills such as marketing skills and communication skills also .
It will also teach us as young people to also know the business side of the world since we will be engaging into conversations with business people on apps such as LinkedIn

08/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 019 2260: So the first step is to know the nature of the company and then go on to search about its structure and the size of the company since we need to target companies which are not too big or too small

There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
