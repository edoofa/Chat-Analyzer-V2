It would be highly appreciated if each of you could take a moment to introduce yourselves.
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 227 4762: I'm an aunt to Silas..
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome you to the group, I am sure you will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in Silas as we move ahead in this journey🚀
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 227 4762: Thank you
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Silas, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 717 9272: My long term goals is to become A computer Engineer and earn while you learn will help me to reduce the costs of my education to reach my goals
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Silas, and remember that I am always there with you to fulfill these!
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 717 9272: No
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
27/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

28/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Yes maam
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session today and will meet on Thursday since due to a personal commitment, I will not be able to take the session tomorrow. So see you on Thursday⚡

How are you?

30/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Welcome ma'am
30/11/23, 1:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

30/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Almost all sections maam
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome Silas!
30/11/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Silas?
30/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 717 9272: That's great maam
30/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you.

30/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 717 9272: It's all about Earn while learn program where edoofians are connecting with different company owners and decision makers in these companies ,sharing with them the vision of the Edoofa

01/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 717 9272: On searching of the companies you should consider the nature of companies you are looking for and also the founders of the companies and mostly you should look for the companies that are student centric
01/12/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Silas, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

07/12/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Noted
07/12/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Silas/Saloni/7DEC2023*
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
08/12/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Noted maam
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood this Silas?
08/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 717 9272: Understood
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Were you able to form the group?
08/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 717 9272: I thought we have not finished learning part
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I would be further sharing what kind of resources that you can share with them but you can start forming the group by today.
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

08/12/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Silas. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
08/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 717 9272: For now I don't have ma'am
08/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
