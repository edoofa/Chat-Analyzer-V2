Alright we can begin
21/08/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
21/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you very much .l am thrilled as well
21/08/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Even I am very excited!

21/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright thank you very much. I use my mother's  phone for these sessions and there is my father in this group

21/08/23, 9:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Leiann, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
21/08/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you very much. My long term goals are to become one of the best planners here in Zimbabwe  and abroad .l would like to build my own company of planners as well though l know it will take time but with hardwork and effort l know l will achieve it.

21/08/23, 9:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 911 5405: No l am not aware of them
21/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
21/08/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
21/08/23, 9:20 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright thank you very much for the good information
21/08/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 911 5405: I have read it
21/08/23, 9:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/08/23, 9:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped from it?
21/08/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 911 5405: From the above message l learnt that the EWYL program provides a platform  where one has the opportunity  to earn whilst learning with the help of the counsellors.I also learnt that one gets to be equiped with skills as well
22/08/23, 8:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

22/08/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 911 5405: Good morning .Yes we can

22/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

Let me share about myself…
22/08/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
22/08/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

22/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped about me from the video?
22/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 911 5405: I learnt that a good mentor is who does not expect any form of payment but one who is happy to see their mentee successful.As my mentor your role is to use your experience and knowledge to  give me advice,support and answer all the questions that l have
22/08/23, 9:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear that honestly!
 I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
22/08/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes l did
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you very much. Yes 20 minutes are enough

22/08/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 911 5405: I have read it and that's  a good message
22/08/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
22/08/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 911 5405: True l loved all the sections but l loved the qoute that says".......only you can stop you".Honestly that was quite a powerful message for me
22/08/23, 9:31 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.

Awareness which means to keep myself updated about things or events around  me.
There is also social media literacy where businesses are now using different  social media  platforms  to advertise or do any form of marketing there.



I also noted that Edoofa will give me projects to do.One of these projects is called COPORATE ALLIANCES
In this project Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers.I noted that an Edoofian will gain certain skills  such as networking skills or even building my self confidence. I also learnt that l will be connecting with different  organisations ,arranging meetings with them via video calls or zoom meetings and also signing contracts.


There is also another project called COMMUNITY BUILDING


Community  building  is a  field of practices  directed towards the creation or enhancement of community amoung individuals within a regional area or with a common need or interest.

29/08/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 911 5405: From the document l managed to pick up a few things.l also noted that the task is to look for companies that can collaborate with Eddofa and are willing to extent their help in the overall development of students  who enroll for the Edoofa program. To make sure one looks for the right  companies he or she must consider the following  factors:


Nature of the company
Scale of company.Companies should have employees ranging from 50 to 200.

Step 2
After getting a few details regarding the company one has to study the company a  little to get more information in terms of its functions.

I'll see you on *Thursday* from 08:30-09:30 AM since the organization will remain closed on the occasion of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
29/08/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 911 5405: Wow that sounds fun. Have a great Raksha Bandan

29/08/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 911 5405: Is it okay if l resume the EWYL sessions when l come back home
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_
How are you?

So, I would like to share a piece of happiness that I experienced and received from my family yesterday. As I informed you yesterday we were celebrating Raksha Bandhan, let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated at my side👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 8:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 911 5405: Wow that really looks fun.Looks like you had a great day
31/08/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed, I had a really lovely day!
31/08/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
31/08/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till ___ (date) because I am having my exams from __ to ___ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
31/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 77 911 5405: Ok l will let you know
31/08/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 911 5405: I have sent the message to all the email addresses
01/09/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Leiann!

01/09/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me check and I will come back to you.
01/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 911 5405: I am fine how are you
01/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 911 5405: Alright
08/09/23, 2:54 pm - +91 85956 45071 left
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
17/09/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Hello , how are you. 
Hope you are doing well also. Let us go ahead on Tuesday,  l will reserve time for this. Thank you
19/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Greetings also. How are you doing.
19/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Sorry we have poor network here
19/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
19/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work uopn three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Leiann will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
19/09/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
19/09/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 411 1052: Thank you so much  l was still going through document. I'm very pleased with this knowledge and skills which Edoofians are highlighting people to better success. Will meet you on Friday again , Thanks once again
22/09/23, 12:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 911 5405: Greetings how are you. Ok I'm ready
22/09/23, 12:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
22/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy and delighted to hear that you liked the document and you found it very knowledgeable.
22/09/23, 12:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Leiann can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 911 5405: Ok Ms saloni I'm glad to hear that.as Leiann's parents we will try by all means not to miss the sessions.we wiil be communicating with you.
22/09/23, 1:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
22/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 411 1052: No the student is not available now since she is at a Boarding school. But us as parent we can play our part. The only thing to us is to finance this program to success.
So we didn't go to higher levels of education as she is going now , so we end up unable to answer for her. Thanks
22/09/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before she takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before she herself is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
22/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once done, please share a screenshot.
22/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 411 1052: I'm sorry for my late response firstly.
To  our sessions let's use Tuesday and Friday that will be better for me.
On weekend activities, no problem we can share as Edoofians.Thank for taking most of your time having me and my entire family as part of the Edoofians on the EWYL Line. I'm proud to say this because it is taking us to a higher level.

I also learnt about awareness . Awareness  is keeping ourselves updated of the things or events around us.
30/11/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 911 5405: I also learnt about acquiring  skills.Being aware of the skills that are required to achieve  a certain goal is very important. I also learnt about  Social media literacy.With social media literacy  businesses  are now interacting with customers on different  social media platforms. I also learnt  about the projects which can be done by an Edoofian.One of the projects is Coporate Alliances. In this project one will be interacting with different  heads  of companies or organisations  and signing contracts with them. One can also interact with these heads of companies via Linked in.The other one is community  building. Community building is a field of practices  directed  towards the creation or enhancement of community among individuals within a regional area or  with a common need or interest .
30/11/23, 10:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, you have expressed your thoughts with so much clarity, and communication🫶🏻
30/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
30/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

30/11/23, 10:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
30/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes so from the audio file l learnt that the obective of the project called coporate  alliance  is to gain an understanding  of the market one plans to enter in the near future and preparing for it at an early stage.For one to connect with the great companies that are technologically  driven one has to star with their immediate  network for example family members or parents of friends who work in the service  sector.I also learnt that one uses a professional  networking platform  such as linked in account .Linked in allowes one to search for companies and connect with their  employees. The linked in application  can be downloaded from Playstore or Applestore.One will be reaching out to managers or heads of companies through  linked in.One will be initiating conversations and gathering  their contact information to set up meetings  with Edoofa.
30/11/23, 11:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will definitely discuss this tomorrow, don't worry.
30/11/23, 11:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Our session for today is coming to a close, but I'm already looking forward to catching up with you tomorrow from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group! 🏆 Get ready for another productive and energizing session. Can't wait to see you there!

04/12/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
04/12/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright  maam
04/12/23, 10:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
04/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 911 5405: From the document l understood  that the task is to look for potential companies which  are willing to callaborate with Edoofa. I also grasped some concepts  on the factors to  consider  when searching for  co2
04/12/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Leiann, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
04/12/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
04/12/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers : *$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa : *$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
04/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 911 5405: Sorry about that l would like to continue. I also grasped some concepts  on the factors to consider when searching for  companies. These include nature of the  company.On nature of the company l learnt that the company  must be student centric or it could be recreational or content centric.There were  some  examples mentioned  which are Ed-tech. Ed - tech uses platforms like Obami.We also have another factor like scale of the company. The company has to have a scale which is not too big nor too small Company employees must be ranging from 50-200.There are also steps taken in choosing companies.these are about 6 steps. Step 1is the searching stage. In this step one one can search for start up news.
04/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you so much
04/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 911 5405: Wow l think that will be fun
04/12/23, 10:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is absolutely stunning, you have summed the document in the best way that it could have been done🔥
Let me share a small and quick summary just for a short revision.
04/12/23, 10:40 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
04/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you very much
04/12/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Leiann? I can help you.
04/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes l have a question. My question is why do l have reach out to companies like the ones you recommended  and not Real Estate /construction  companies which somehow are likned to my program.
04/12/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, there is no hard and fast rule for the same. You can reach out to them but we should be clear on how they would be benefitting our students.
04/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright thank you very much. I understand that
04/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: *Leiann, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Leiann!
04/12/23, 10:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
04/12/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 911 5405: Thank you very much maam. See you there as well
05/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 911 5405: Good morning Ms Saloni l would like to inform you that l will not be available for today's session. Thank you very much.
05/12/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Leiann,
How are you?

06/12/23, 10:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Leiann,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
06/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 911 5405: Good morning .Yes we can
06/12/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you listen to this audio?
06/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes l did
06/12/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
06/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 77 911 5405: From the audio file l learnt that all the Edoofians have a great sense of community building. Commubity building refers the process of establishing  and strengthening  connections, relationships and identity among the  individuals within a particular group or community.This involves  creating a supportive and inclusive alignment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate , communicate  and work towards common goals. The goal of community building  is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in a shared responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.The primary  outcome of the project community  building  is for students to develop  networking and persuasion  skills .
06/12/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Leiann, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
06/12/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

06/12/23, 10:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-

06/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 911 5405: Than you very much for the information
06/12/23, 11:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
06/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright thank you very much maam
07/12/23, 10:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Leiann,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?
07/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 911 5405: Good morning Ms Saloni  how are you. I would like to  apologise for being late
07/12/23, 10:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know why are you late for the session😓
07/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 911 5405: I had gone to buy some groceries  and l didn't know that it will take time.My deepest apologies maam.
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that your daily chores are completely important but I hope you realize the time and how crucial these sessions are. You are a bright student, I am sure you will understand that.
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Leiann/Saloni/7DEC2023*
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes l am really  sorry about that
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
07/12/23, 10:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
07/12/23, 10:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
07/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 911 5405: Alright that is well noted maam
07/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 911 5405: So l have a question should l create the group now or when l get to India
07/12/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 10:00-11:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
07/12/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Create the group now.
08/12/23, 8:03 am - +263 77 911 5405: Good morning Ms Saloni may you please add Leiann's number in the group because l as the mother will be travelling  for an  emergency.Thank you very much
08/12/23, 8:04 am - +263 77 911 5405: Leiann.vcf (file attached)
08/12/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning parent,

08/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 911 5405: It is Leiann because my mother has not yet left the house
08/12/23, 10:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that is alright!
08/12/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you try to create the group?
08/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 911 5405: Well l havent created the group yet but l was thinking won't  people find it hard to believe me that Edoofa is not a scam when l haven't  been  there myself
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you want me to share some exponential resources with you so that you can change there perspective?
08/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 911 5405: Yes maam l think that will be of great help
08/12/23, 11:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 10:00-11:00 AM 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.

11/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 911 5405: Aright the links are in my phone but firstly l wanted to first speak with the group admin so that l can ask permission to send any information concerning  Edoofa because this is a school group . I think the admin is a teacher at the school l am targeting hence l wouldn't  want to be rude and just post without permission
11/12/23, 10:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, that is completely understandable.
Does the class have any unofficial class group?
11/12/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 911 5405: So far l am not sure . I will have to conduct a resa
11/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 911 5405: sorry l  meant  that l will  have to conduct a research  and let you know when l get my phone fixed.
