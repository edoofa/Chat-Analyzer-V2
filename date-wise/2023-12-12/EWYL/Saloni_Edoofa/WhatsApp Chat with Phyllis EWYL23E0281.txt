I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

20/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yh sure l had a good experience.
I will have to identify companies that are in line with my program in my home country thus through my friends,relatives and even my parents friends.
After identification l would like to reach out to them and even their employees.

Having reached out also means that l can plan for a call with my manager in Edoofa and maybe we can sign a MoU .
This will enhance my scholarship as per designated values with the organization
20/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 525 5853: This will even enhance and open links after l finish my program.
20/11/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Phyllis. I’m happy with your understanding.
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
20/11/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

May we begin with our exciting session for today🏆
22/11/23, 1:46 am - +263 77 525 5853: Sorry to type for you this late.
It's unfortunate that yesterday when l tried to reach out to you the network this side was on emergency calls only so l could not communicate so l just thought of just leaving the message and will connect today at the usual time if nothing bad happens again.
I am having network challenges here especially with the rain season that has just started it maybe a bit misbehaving.
But anyway I hope this message conveys to you in good state.
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Phyllis,
How are you?
22/11/23, 12:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you for reaching out and updating me on the network challenges you're facing. I completely understand that technical issues can arise, especially during the rainy season. Your efforts to communicate despite the circumstances are appreciated.

No need to apologize; your message came through clearly, and I understand the situation. It's important to prioritize safety and well-being, and I hope the network stabilizes soon.
23/11/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon, Phyllis!

24/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Ummm it's just that l came to Harare for the payment of my registration fee so l did that and forwarded the receipt to my parents but it was so unfortunate that my battery was running low that l could not even notify you
And l'm sorry for that too
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, that is alright!
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Is the payment done now?
24/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Hopefully you received the receipt and confirmed right

24/11/23, 2:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sure you must have shared this with the Admission team?
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yh my parents did that in the other group too.
24/11/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yh l really appreciate their doing and l'm glad l have such parents
24/11/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you learned from it?
24/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 525 5853: That one was an extra understanding audio file for my second project .it's only says that l have to work on networking with high school graduates and connect them with edoofa.and foe every role l partake in a certain amount is to be deducted  or l should say is to be earned to my scholarship.
This is l should connect students from my country of origin or even away.
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Phyllis, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

27/11/23, 1:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This, you have to ask in your Admission Group only because they look after this.
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I had a great time, thank you!
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Okay

27/11/23, 1:47 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Yh l did understood
27/11/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
27/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 525 5853: It will be my pleasure to attain these scholarship credits even with outstandings
27/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 525 5853: I understand this part
27/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great Phyllis and I am there with you always!
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 525 5853: I appreciate that
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 525 5853: You can go ahead
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Phyllis/Saloni/27NOV2023*
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
27/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
27/11/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
27/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Ooooh well l will start working on that now
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, indeed!
May I know what have you understood from it?
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 525 5853: That l have to create a group with a title of myself/mentor and date created.

I have to communicate with form 6 and 5 students so that they can have an understanding on how the scholarship works
And by so doing maybe l could have conveyed the message to about 60 students and it will be enhanced by sharing my group link
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome, you have understood it well.
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

How do Yu take it
01/12/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
01/12/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Let me start doing that now

05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Your session will be from 12:00-01:30 PM on
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*MONDAY and THURSDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
05/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Oooh well l will be flexible to these new changes
05/12/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, once you do this do let me know.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 525 5853: Consider it done
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 525 5853: And l'm done
11/12/23, 8:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Phyllis!
