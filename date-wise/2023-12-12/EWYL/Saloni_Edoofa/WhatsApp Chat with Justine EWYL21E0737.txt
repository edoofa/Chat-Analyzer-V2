How are you doing?

I just had to share my excitement – meeting my students at the airport and seeing their faces in person was such an amazing feeling🤩

Now, I can't help but look forward to more airport meetups. So, I'm curious, how are your plans coming along? 
When will you be joining us in India?
I'm really looking forward to it and can't wait to see you here!
14/08/23, 1:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *16/08/2023 from 07:00-08:00 PM IST | 03:30-04:30 PM ZIMB TIME*  to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 073 6090: Yes I did maam
17/08/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 073 6090: I have a number of questions
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 073 6090: Firstly,
It's stated that if I don't utilise my grant for a certain year the grant grant will not elapse to the following year

May you give me more insight on thay
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 073 6090: That*
17/08/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If you decide not to use your grant for the first year then you would not be able to carry the $300 of first year to second year. <This message was edited>
17/08/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 073 6090: So that would be cancelled, ohky
17/08/23, 4:13 pm - +263 78 073 6090: What about for example I have paid tuition for the first year does that mean the 300 that was allocated for my first year has been 😁 cancelled?
17/08/23, 4:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: They are not cancelled, you were given the option of the same but if you choose to pay the entire fees yourself then the grant amount won't be acrried carried forward.
17/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 073 6090: OK ok
17/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 073 6090: Do the scholarship credits work the same way ???
17/08/23, 4:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you use your scholarship, they will also not be carried forward.
17/08/23, 4:29 pm - +263 78 073 6090: What if I don't use them, say in my second d semester I earn significant amount of credits but my tuition for that semester is fully paid, will they cary over to the next year,  the scholarship credits ???
18/08/23, 4:08 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are well.

We've witnessed an incredible journey together, haven't we?

14/09/23, 4:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Justin, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from your home country, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to your University in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

 *Week 1*: Call on Saturday
📅 14/10/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 1:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*

I am doing fine
16/10/23, 8:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: You are such a bright student and you have already shared how your sessions will be going to happen. But out of 4, you have already missed one session. May I know how will you get the updates of what was discussed in the session?
16/10/23, 8:24 am - +91 73473 53880: I got the updates from the other students who attended the webinar and I am going to confirm with you before I do anythinf

16/10/23, 9:15 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is not about the webinar, I am sure you are aware of our weekly call plan?

16/10/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: But Justine the call schedule was shared on Tuesday itself.
16/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 073 6090: Ma'am if you are referring to these call schedules yes I know them

I thought you were referring to the call timings you shared with the other students during the Video call on Saturday, the one I failed to attend
16/10/23, 10:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, these are the same calls. One talks about the schedule and the other were the calls that were conducted as a part of this schedule.
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since you mentioned your reason for not attending the call on Saturday and finding it genuine, I am now sharing with you the task that was shared and that will _mark your attendance for the month of October_📆
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to make a 3-4 minutes video and the video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *DEADLINE FOR THE VIDEO* - 17/12/2023, 5 PM

Kindly acknowledge your presence for tomorrow's session. 💬
17/10/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: Also, I am sure you are aware to share the video with me by today, I can't wait!
17/10/23, 10:29 am - +91 73473 53880: Good afternoon ma'am

Yes I am aware of the deadline 

But I may not be able to meet the deadline ma'am
17/10/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: But can you share the video by tonight?
18/10/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tell me honestly, till when can you share the video?
18/10/23, 3:31 pm - +91 73473 53880: Oh Saturday ma'am 

I will share the video not later than this Saturday
18/10/23, 3:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, do that by Saturday.
18/10/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Adding to it Justin, all the forms that you will now be sharing, will now go through a _pre-counseling_ process so that we filter out the students as per the details that they have mentioned, and yes, as I informed you since you are a part of the *$300 plan* your forms will be counseled on priority. Therefore, it is very necessary that all the students that you refer, primarily know:
1. What Edoofa is?
2. How Edoofa can benefit them?
3. Why are they filling out the student application form?
4. Are they aware of your journey?
18/10/23, 3:37 pm - +91 73473 53880: Okay I will tell them

And about point number 4 yeah I did not really tell anyone about my journey
18/10/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, from now onwards that you are here in India finally, share with students how your journey has been or you can directly share with them the video that you will make.
18/10/23, 3:47 pm - +91 73473 53880: Okay ma'am 😅
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yess!
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also Justin, when you were back in your home country, your performance was truly outstanding, and it filled me with immense joy and confidence that you'd work wonders when you came to India. However, since your arrival, I've noticed a dip in your engagement and participation, which has given me pause. I'd love to understand the challenges you're currently facing so that I can provide the necessary support to help you overcome them. Your success is still very much within reach, and we're here to make sure you excel! 🚀🤝
18/10/23, 3:51 pm - +91 73473 53880: I never did before 

I wasn't used to sharing what is happening my life 😁
18/10/23, 3:53 pm - +91 73473 53880: It is not only that;

Some things are not yet in order but by the end of the week I expect to have adjusted my life 😁
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 73473 53880: School life***
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I understand it.
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Speaking from the heart, over the past two months, I've closely observed many students thriving through the $300 scholarship plan. It's when I don't see your name on that list, I must admit, it stirs up a mix of emotions for me - concern, a touch of worry, and a whole lot of hope.
18/10/23, 3:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want you to know that our time spent on these monthly tasks isn't just about the tasks themselves; it's about the bigger picture. It's about watching you earn well and becoming self-sufficient. Your success means a lot to me, and I'm genuinely invested in your journey toward financial independence.
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 73473 53880: Yes I understand ma'am 

I dp
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - +91 73473 53880: Do*
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As our session comes to an end, I want you to know that I'm genuinely grateful for the connection we've shared. Each day is a canvas of emotions, and I hope your day is filled with joy and fulfillment. If ever you find yourself in need of support or just a friendly chat, remember I'm here for you. Wishing you an uplifting day! 🌟💕
18/10/23, 4:08 pm - +91 73473 53880: *Dhyanawad* [thank you] ma'am 🌚

What will take longer may be the editing part so I have to shoot the video at least 4 to 5 hours before the deadline which is 8pm😅

But today is just too early😅

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

15/11/23, 4:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

The applicant must know everything about Edoofa. After that then the applicant must answer the questions that are in the document and l can also add some relevant questions if possible.

In short, I as a student leader have to make sure the applicant is well versed about Edoofa before they go to the higher stages
