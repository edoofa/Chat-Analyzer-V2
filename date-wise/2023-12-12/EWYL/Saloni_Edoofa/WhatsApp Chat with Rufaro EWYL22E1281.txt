18/08/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 494 9271: Went through the grant, and as a point of correction, Rufaro is a Zimbabwean, not Zambian, as mentioned.
Also,our preferred University is MVN, not Gulzar...so our thought is for her to sign a document with correct and accurate details

Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and *dual utilization is not permissible*❎
02/09/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2) Maintaining a minimum of *75 percent attendance is necessary for the EWYL Program*🎯

▪️This encompasses three major components : 
A. Active participation in submitting activities, lessons, and project updates.
B. Attending webinars whenever scheduled.
C. regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor's call.

*If any of these things are not done, the grant will be revoked*

14/09/23, 4:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Rufaro, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from your home country, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to your University in the form of a handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

15/11/23, 3:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 2:36 pm - +91 92893 21346: Yes i do
23/11/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?
23/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 92893 21346: Yes
23/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you state them?
23/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 92893 21346: Maintain 75% attendance

 You can redeem either the Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year.whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts

 Failure to fulfil the guidelines mentioned will result in the grant revoked

23/11/23, 3:03 pm - +91 92893 21346: The grant will be redeem only after post successful completion of the university fee  dues according to deadlines

23/11/23, 3:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*
23/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 92893 21346: Yes
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75%.

24/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our session?
24/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 92893 21346: Good evening, yes we can
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
24/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 92893 21346: Yes we can proceed
24/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
24/11/23, 3:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 92893 21346: I understood that i have to attend 2 sessions in December 
2 calls
And i have to submit 10 quality forms
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great Rufaro, and you know, I know you have the capabilities to do it since you are so sincere and dedicated!
24/11/23, 3:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 92893 21346: Well noted
25/11/23, 11:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Rufaro,

Can you please share this video on priority with me?
25/11/23, 11:32 am - +91 92893 21346: Good afternoon 
Sorry I don't understand
25/11/23, 11:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am unable to find the video in my device, therefore I was asking if you can resend the video to me that you shared so that I can store it.
25/11/23, 11:35 am - +91 92893 21346: Ohh ok sure

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
