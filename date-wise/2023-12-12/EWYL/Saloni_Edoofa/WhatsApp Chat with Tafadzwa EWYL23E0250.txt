As a part of the Saturday activity , you are required to delve into the world of celebrity brand endorsements and analyze their significance in increasing brand growth.

With just a camera and a creative mind, individuals can transport audiences into their world, adding a visual and personal touch to their narratives.

08/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 670 0053: Good morning Ms Saloni
08/12/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Tafadzwa,
How are you?

May we begin with our session?

08/12/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood till here?
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 670 0053: Yes , I have understood
08/12/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 670 0053: Noted
08/12/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
08/12/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Tafadzwa/Saloni/8DEC2023*
08/12/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
08/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
08/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
08/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
08/12/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 09:00-10:00 AM 
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
08/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 670 0053: Thank you am also looking forward to the next session
08/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Me too Tafadzwa!
11/12/23, 7:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go? 

This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *09:00 - 10:00* AM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
11/12/23, 8:28 am - +263 77 289 4595: Greetings of the day. I am available ma'am for today's session
11/12/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Did you work on forming the group?
11/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 670 0053: Sorry for responding late.  I formed the group sometime ago named Tafadzwa Saloni 16 June. I just have to revive the group
11/12/23, 9:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, do you try reviving the group this weekend?
11/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 670 0053: I had challenges selling Edoofa to the members of the group because I nolonger have information about Edoofa. The phone formated and l lost all important material.
11/12/23, 9:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, let me share.
11/12/23, 9:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/12/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
11/12/23, 9:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

11/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 670 0053: Thank you much Ms Saloni. Am really grateful
11/12/23, 9:52 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
