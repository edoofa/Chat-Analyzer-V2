15/09/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 11:05 pm - +263 77 295 8227: Greetings.  We acknowledge  receipt of the same.  We as the parents we can complete the sessions on behalf of the student as she is busy with her preparation of her examinations.  Thank you
16/09/23, 10:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

16/09/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that you and your parents may have commitments here at the school, but it's important to recognize that you've come a long way already. You've successfully completed the counseling process and paid your enrollment fees, showing your dedication to this journey. Just as we follow a fixed timetable for classes and office hours, we have a similar schedule for these essential sessions.
16/09/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I want to assure you that I value your time. On my end, I've streamlined the process to just a few days, and in some cases, it can even be completed in a single day. Your participation is crucial, and I kindly ask for your cooperation in acknowledging and attending these sessions. It's a small investment of time for the long-term benefit of your education and future success.
16/09/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 810 7361: My sincere apologies for not cooperating well. I wish to complete everything well so that I will have a good future with your help

21/09/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 810 7361: We can start
21/09/23, 12:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Audrey/parent can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
21/09/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 810 7361: Okay.We are on a same page
21/09/23, 12:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceeding with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know.
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 810 7361: I would like inform you that phones aren't allowed at my school.Today I risked to carry it so that I won't miss the session.Im kindly asking for you to bear with me and sometimes my parents won't be available but I promise I will do my best in everything
21/09/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 810 7361: Today I'm personally available I'm not sure about what my parents are preferring.They are offline right now.But I'm sure they want me to proceed with the program
21/09/23, 12:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is alright, I understand that.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/09/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
21/09/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 810 7361: Okay well noted

21/09/23, 1:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, this is just a basic formality. Once you do this, I will put the Program on hold again, don't worry.
21/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 810 7361: Okay fine
21/09/23, 1:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Have you done it?
