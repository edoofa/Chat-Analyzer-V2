23/09/23, 9:02 am - +91 78273 08969: Good afternoon, Parents and our Edoofian

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
23/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 233 1484: Oh alright but this should benefit Kudzai am I ryt?
23/09/23, 10:21 am - +91 78273 08969: Yes, This will definitely.
23/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 233 1484: It's okay then we can go for it so that she doesn't lag behind
23/09/23, 10:29 am - +91 78273 08969: Could you please choose a slot?
23/09/23, 10:35 am - +263 77 233 1484: Mummy taking Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00pm to 3:00 on.
23/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 233 1484: They don't allow phones at Kudzai s school
23/09/23, 10:46 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, Let us meet at the scheduled time.
23/09/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 233 1484: Sure, thank you enjoy your day,sir!!
25/09/23, 2:12 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Kudzai* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Oh wow that's great!!
25/09/23, 2:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Understood! Great to know Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi are with us thank you
25/09/23, 2:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Kudzai* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 233 1484: It is only Kudzai is in boarding school she will only be free end of November after her exams. Phones are not allowed in her school sir
25/09/23, 2:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: Yes, This is for her when she returns.
25/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Oh okay!!
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once she form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, she would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 2:24 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Ah woow you are growing indeed
25/09/23, 2:35 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for her EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure she is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
25/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Okay
25/09/23, 2:37 pm - +91 78273 08969: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Kudzai will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
25/09/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 233 1484: Will do!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Aditi your new mentor will contact you on Wednesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Aditi's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.
29/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 233 1484: Thank you so much. We wish you a speedy recovery and hope to meet you in the near Future.

12/10/23, 2:24 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the_first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

As it is almost the end of the year let's go down the memory lane upon the amazing *Africa visit by Edoofa's visionary CEOs, Mr. Angad and Mr. Avreen!*💫

Their trip across Africa has been nothing short of amazing, filled with enriching experiences, cultural discoveries, and meaningful connections. On this trip, we gained valuable insights that will undoubtedly shape the future of Edoofa and further enhance the opportunities offered to our students.🚀

Thank you for being a part of the Edoofa family. We can't wait to share more about this unforgettable African expedition!💐

Hope you are well.

I understand but before finalizing your decision, could we discuss the reasons behind it? Perhaps there are alternative options or ways we can explore to address your concerns. I'm here to help and find the best possible solution for your daughter's educational journey.. Looking forward to hearing from you. <This message was edited>
