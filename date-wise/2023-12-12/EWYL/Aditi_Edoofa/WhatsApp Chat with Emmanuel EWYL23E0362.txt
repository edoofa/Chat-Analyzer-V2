How are you?

 I am so elated to inform you that today we embark on the journey of a new batch of students that came to India through us, Edoofa Scholarship Program🇿🇼
I feel so delighted to have them all here and yes, indeed it was so emotional and mesmerizing. I was literally shivering and teary seeing all of them.
I believe that about such moments, words well short of, and yes, I was definitely short of words. There it is the moment we all have been waiting for, have a look at this.

01/08/23, 9:11 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Wow this is great
01/08/23, 9:12 pm - +263 71 562 1195: So Emotional i can feel it to
03/08/23, 8:16 am - +263 71 562 1195: Morning
03/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Emmanuel
Hope that you are doing well.
03/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let's begin with our today's discussions🚀
03/08/23, 8:30 am - +263 71 562 1195: Sure lets do that
03/08/23, 8:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great Emmanuel!
03/08/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Emmanuel, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
03/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 562 1195: My first Goal is to work hard to become a Giant in the Journalism World,hence i could help people to figure out challenges they will be facing in their lives.
I am someone who care about people and some of my main goals is to use Money i am going to get from the Journalism to open free schools like School of Acting,Dancing,Music,Music studios and Sports associations so that we could help Young People with talent because i did'nt have chance to showcase my dreams when i was growing due to the sense that to get to a soccer Academy you need to register and what if you don't have the money and you have talent your dreams could fade.
03/08/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: That is amazing Emmanuel!
03/08/23, 8:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/08/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 562 1195: No i don't
03/08/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
03/08/23, 8:53 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
03/08/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 562 1195: Noted and Understood.
03/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
03/08/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 562 1195: Wow this is nice
03/08/23, 9:07 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
03/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 562 1195: Okay thank you so much.Its nice to know them.
03/08/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: - I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
03/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 562 1195: Super interesting
03/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great Emmanuel.
03/08/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

16/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Okay i will do that
16/08/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you! <This message was edited>
16/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Noted
16/08/23, 2:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
16/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 562 1195: okay
16/08/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*EMMANUEL/ADITI/16AUG23*
16/08/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
16/08/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
16/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 562 1195: noted
16/08/23, 2:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
16/08/23, 2:16 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Emmanuel, I would like you to make this group alongside our discussions so that you can start earning credits alongside our discussions.
16/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 562 1195: like right now
16/08/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes.
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Do inform me once done.
16/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 562 1195: okay
16/08/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, I will be waiting for your response.
16/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 562 1195: DONE
16/08/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!

17/08/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: No need to worry, you can manage it based on your timetable, but make sure to prioritize it as it holds significant importance. Remember, this will help you earn scholarship credits.

17/08/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now comes the interesting part where you will be rewarded with scholarship credits for networking with your connection. 
After the student shares their referral and once they have a personalized counseling session with one of our career counselors just like how you have experienced, the counselor will ask some points of the student regarding how they got to know about Edoofa and if they understand our program structure. I hope you have explained to the student as we have discussed right?
17/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 562 1195: As i said i was busy yesterday i will help explain it to them yesterday
17/08/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay.
17/08/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
17/08/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 562 1195: okay
17/08/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
17/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 562 1195: This is all about African School Education reform Mission where  you make your teachers proud telling them how luck you qualified for the  Edoofa program. So you need to reach out to local Schools and Headmasters tell them all about the program.
17/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Details and plan a meeting with directors
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have. However I’ll explain this project quickly for you in 2 steps:  I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Yeah maybe i should reach out to as many schools as i can
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you should.
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap the project

 As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

01/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Details submitted by*:

2. EWYL Group Name: 
3. How did you get to know about the school and what did you discuss with the contact person?
01/09/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

08/09/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

08/09/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Okay
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
08/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 71 562 1195: Understood

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I trust this message finds you in high spirits! 😊 I wanted to touch base regarding our missed session on Monday, and I hope you had a fantastic Diwali break.

Given the festive spirit, it seems our schedules got a bit tangled. No worries at all! How about we reschedule our session today between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM? 
Looking forward to connecting and picking up where we left off!
