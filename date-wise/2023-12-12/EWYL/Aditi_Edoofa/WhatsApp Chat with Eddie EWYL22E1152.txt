With full appreciation of your time and consideration , I am very sorry to alert you that I will be unable to participate in today's session because there is a church function during the period of the session and we are all forced to attend.
I'm totally sorry.

20/10/23, 7:38 am - +263 78 026 7110: Greetings.
Thank you for the time you gave me. The exams so far so good. 
However, I am going through 3 exams and I have a very low possibility of being online.  Therefore I am asking for some time off til 1 November when I am done with these exams that I need to give all my time and diligence.
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well.

I appreciate your update, and I'm glad to hear that your exams are going well. It's important to prioritize your studies, so I completely understand your need for some time off to focus on your exams.
Good luck with your exams!
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
20/10/23, 8:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:


Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
05/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 026 7110: Wow I am very excited for everyone. Hope to make someone proud too. Thank you for the update
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
