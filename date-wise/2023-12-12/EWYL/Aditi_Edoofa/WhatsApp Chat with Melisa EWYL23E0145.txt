It's Melisa ,, I'll be going to school everyday from 0700 to 1500 so if I can proceed with my EWYL journey from 1500 everyday it will be great but if yu are not comfortable with the time we will have to switch to November 
Thank you
16/08/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
16/08/23, 1:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hope you are well.
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: These timings do not align with my schedule.
I want Melisa you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and aditii.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com
16/08/23, 1:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.
16/08/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 274 4412: Thanks for asking we are fine and you I will pass your message when she comes from extra lessons anytime after 18:00
16/08/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay that would be appreciated.
16/08/23, 3:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you.

16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Melisa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 10:37 am - +263 71 813 7664: Good morning sir 
I'll take option 2
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Saturday from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.?
16/09/23, 10:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also I would like to mention that I am a female so I would appreciate it if you would address me as Ms. Aditi or ma'am.
16/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 813 7664: Sir Shivjeet has been helping me with my admissions from 0730 pm to 1030 pm
16/09/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 813 7664: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 813 7664: Sorry ma'am
16/09/23, 10:44 am - +263 71 813 7664: Yes ma'am
16/09/23, 10:49 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.

30/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Melisa! I'm thrilled to catch up with you and get all the details about your current project progress and the amazing ways you've been upskilling yourself. So, let's dive right in and share the incredible journey you've been on!
30/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 813 7664: I've been through some counselling with Mr  Shivjeet but he seems so busy these days so we rarely have our sessions ,,The program that I'll be focusing on is Cardiovascular technology ,, I working very hard to attain the number of points that will support my dream
30/09/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: It sounds like you've been working diligently toward your goal in Cardiovascular technology. It's understandable that scheduling conflicts can be frustrating when it comes to counseling sessions.
30/09/23, 9:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Melisa, may I know about your EWYL Journey progress as well.
30/09/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 813 7664: I didn't start with EWYL journey i was suppose to start in May but i was going to school so i postponed it
30/09/23, 9:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, understood.
30/09/23, 9:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: So we will begin with that and make sure that you don't stay behind your peers.
30/09/23, 9:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, you would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as you can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that you will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>

07/12/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay I'll share with you 
So if they fill I'll have to send it back with the details
07/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Alright mam 
It's clear
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*MELISA/ADITI*
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
07/12/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

07/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 813 7664: 60 students 🥶🥶 Alright I'll try my best
07/12/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You can do it, I know you have the potential and I will be there to help you out at every step.
07/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 813 7664: Okay mam
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
08/12/23, 2:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
08/12/23, 2:31 pm - Aditi Edoofa: You know, Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Herewith I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
