02/08/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
02/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Have been briefed about EWYL but would kindly ask better clarification of these objectives for better understanding
02/08/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
02/08/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
02/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Thank you ma'am
02/08/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
02/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Okay thank you ma'am for the information there was very helpful now l surely know the two objectives of EWYL program

Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
02/08/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

03/08/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Okay thank you ma'am

03/08/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.

 I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
03/08/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>

03/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Okay thanks you for asking but l think I am fine with the way we are connected for now.Will tell if think something needs to be done ma'am.
03/08/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright!
03/08/23, 2:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
03/08/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 978 7648: Yes it sounds interesting
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know on
ce you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

10/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
10/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope it is okay with you?
10/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

10/08/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Once done, please let me know.
10/08/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That concludes my input for today!

16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tanyaradzwa!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:27 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 978 7648: How are you ms. Aditi l consider option two better

Thank you for understanding.
20/09/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 978 7648: It's okay ma'am no problem

07/10/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 978 7648: I have learned about edoofians students community where they create a supportive  community to achieves successes.Students  are expected to use network services to help edoofa organization grow by telling them about it.The edoofa will offer scholarship credits to these edoofians students worth 20 to 40 dollars

07/10/23, 9:44 am - Aditi Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

I have an interest in the following fields of study. (Select the relevant one):-

Arts
Science
Commerce

Subject Combination in A Level:-
Current Class (L5 / L6 / U6):

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
07/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 978 7648: Okay Maam let me share the form
07/10/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
07/10/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
07/10/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
07/10/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
07/10/23, 10:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
14/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 978 7648: How are you ma'am
14/10/23, 1:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 463 9366: 1.First Choice private school

May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 463 9366: Okay fine will reach out to them
06/12/23, 2:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When you will have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
06/12/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_

Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

06/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 463 9366: Okay thanks
06/12/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now let me share some important resources with you that you can share with the School Head

06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
06/12/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 463 9366: Okay will try to get contact of private school around  me because most of schools around me  are government schools with feea less than 100 dollars

07/12/23, 3:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
