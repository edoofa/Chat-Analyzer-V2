15/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 120 3249: SUMMARY OF THE EWYL PROGRAM

Edoofa Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program has been instrumental in providing higher education which is Accessible, Affordable and makes you Employable. In today's COVID affected world the EWYL can only bet on two things that is awareness and acquiring skills

Awareness means to keep ourselves updated about things / events happening around us. In terms of career it means we should be well informed about various events in the world that will have a bearing on our career paths.

Acquiring skills, a direct and the biggest benefit of being aware is to understand the SKILLS that we should acquire to reach our career goals , These skills must be aligned with your aspirations.

There are skills that will always be there that require a high degree of creativity, emotional, intelligence and strategy thinking. Basically, these are the functions that machines cannot do for example Relationship building, empathy, risk taking and many others.

In project 1 of the EWYL program , Edoofians will represent Edoofa to build a network of partner companies and potential employers. This will help them create a strong professional network and earn scholarship credits.

In project 2  , students will reach out to their personal and extended networks and offer an opportunity to be part of the Edoofa's educational ecosystem and acquire International education which prepares them for the future. This opportunity must reach every youth who is motivated and has a zeal to create great careers.

In project 3 students will reach out to local schools in their local region and will speak to decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa.
15/09/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Thank you and I wish you a great weekend ahead

Online Work
There's a great opportunity to connect with technology and digital companies within one's country. To accomplish this one must start with family members or parents of their friends. One must share objectives and explain how Edoofa is helping with necessary skills for employment after graduation.

19/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Guide for searching companies


The task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with EDOOFA and are 
willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for 
the EDOOFA programme. To make sure that one looks for the right type of companies, 
one must keep into consideration the following factors:
a) NATURE OF COMPANY: The nature of company must be either student centric 
or it could be recreation or it 
could be a content-centric platform
 b) SCALE OF COMPANY: The scale of the selected company should not be either too 
big or too small. Keep into consideration the employee size of the company (can vary 
from 50-200)
c) FINANCIAL STABILITY: Companies so selected must be financially sound. 

d) BACKGROUND OF FOUNDER: Companies with a founder having a strong 
background (in terms of experiences and qualifications) are the most suitable ones.

STEP 1: searching
STEP 2: start studying a little 
more about the company & its functioning. 
STEP 3: study the website of the company.
STEP 4: check the various social media pages of the company.
STEP 5: study the background of the founder and other core members. 
STEP 6: start reaching out 
to them by dropping an invitation note and sending a connection request.

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
21/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Okay Ms Aditi thank you very much
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Okay
21/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*CHARMAINE/ADITI/21SEPT23*
21/09/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Do I have to create it today
21/09/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you may
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

2. I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.So I recommend your school to give its students get higher education which is affordable

25/09/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
25/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 120 3249: Okay I will check the school fees amount
25/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!

25/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 120 3249: I have a small problem, currently I'm not in my home town that is why it is taking me longer to create a group for other students and it might also take long to get my former school headmaster's number

And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

We will reconvene on November 14 and I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity.🤩
09/11/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle🕯️, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
14/11/23, 10:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning!
