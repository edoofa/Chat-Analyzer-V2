05/12/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: It's wonderful to learn more about your family. The dedication to education seems to run in the family with both your mother and father being teachers. Their commitment to shaping young minds is commendable.
05/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 311 2014: Yes that's why they worry much about my education too taking risks just for me reach maximum education
05/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's understandable.
05/12/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: So I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 77 311 2014: I would like to be a computer scientist, there to be that I should study bachelor of science in computer science. As I investigate and conclude that India have a better performance in tertiary education I decided to study there so that I would attain my goals. I was so lucky to be enrolled in Edoofa scholarship program. EWYL program help me to a greater extended as 
1) It will reduce my tuition costs which will be affordable for my parents thereby I would run easily on my education without stressing my parents on those fees.
2) I t will help me grow in mind and help me gain marketing skills and other real life skills
05/12/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your aspirations and journey with me. It's fantastic to hear about your ambition to become a computer scientist and pursue a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Choosing India for your tertiary education due to its strong performance in this field is a strategic decision.

Enrolling in the Edoofa scholarship program is a significant step, and I'm glad to hear that the EWYL program has been beneficial for you. It's great that the program is not only reducing your tuition costs, making education more affordable for your parents, but also providing you with opportunities to grow intellectually and develop valuable skills, including marketing skills.
05/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 77 311 2014: Yes please.
05/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 311 2014: I guess they are the two I mentioned above. Aren't they?
05/12/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 311 2014: If not then enlighten me
05/12/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 9:04 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 311 2014: Getting to know deeper thank you for adding more on my understanding
05/12/23, 9:10 am - +263 77 311 2014: Well well that's good
05/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 311 2014: That's good to work in teams
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Indeed!
05/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 311 2014: Yes please
05/12/23, 9:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

07/12/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 311 2014: Let me go through it
07/12/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
07/12/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
07/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 77 311 2014: Do I need to open the links now or I will later after our sessions for us to have flowing discussions
07/12/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can do it later after the session, Nigel.
07/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 311 2014: The steps are like this.
I should consider the following:
a) Nature of the company: It should be either student-centric or recreational or content-centric platform.
e.g For Ed-tech platforms; Brainshare, Obami

Recreational/ app-based platforms; OurHood, Palm Pay

Content centric platforms; Africazilla, Over Saturated

b) Scale of Company: It should not be neither too big nor too small. Consideration of size vary from 50-200 employees

c) Financial stability: I will Use LinkedIn or other related fact findings for help on updates.

d) Background of founder: I will look for companies with strong founder background. I will gather information using platforms mentioned.

Step 1: I will search using any of the platforms following the given examples for each platform. Linkedin I guess is the best in providing more detailed information I will be looking for.

Step 2: I will then study a little more about the company and its functioning. Google as a platform is responsible for that.

Step 3: Then after I will study the website of the company and check if it is working properly and how it function. This will help to find information about founders. I will study reviews also.

Step 4: I will check various social media pages of the company. This will add on relevant information I am looking for.

Step 5: I will find understanding on the founder and core members' backgrounds. LinkedIn is the best for this task.

Step 6: Now I will drop invitation note and sending connection request on individuals of the company. It is good for me to first reach out to the heads of various departments.
07/12/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: You know what, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
07/12/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
07/12/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
07/12/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Concluding the session, I must express my appreciation for this valuable interaction. I eagerly look forward to our next session.
07/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 77 311 2014: Thank you
07/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 311 2014: Can you describe on that Designation like elaborate further on what is required on that field
07/12/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: We will discuss it tomorrow in your session, okay?
07/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 311 2014: Wow I will work hard towards that
07/12/23, 9:36 am - +263 77 311 2014: Have a great day ahead Ms Aditi
07/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 311 2014: 👍
08/12/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday🌟
Hope you are well.

Let's begin today's amazing session!
08/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 311 2014: I am doing good.
Let's start
08/12/23, 8:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
08/12/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, Let us discuss how we can find suitable companies.
We can do that via platforms like Google, Instagram, Facebook, and most importantly Linked In.
I will need you to create your accounts on all these platforms and share your usernames with me in our session in the format mentioned below:
Instagram Username:
Facebook Username:
Linked In Id Link:

Now, When you have created the accounts on all these platforms, You can use the search features provided on all these platforms to look for companies that suit our criteria.
08/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 311 2014: I would appreciate if you answer me on that one please
08/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 311 2014: Let me do the same
08/12/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure, thank you for reminding.
08/12/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: So basically, in that field you have to fill in the job title/ designation of the person of the company whom you have reached out to, okay?

Also Designation is like a label or title that tells us what someone's job or role is. It's the name given to a specific position or rank in a company or organization. For example, a designation could be "Manager," "Engineer," or "Teacher." It helps people understand what a person does in their work
08/12/23, 8:44 am - +263 77 311 2014: Thank you
08/12/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
08/12/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Also, I would like to tell you that currently this project is on hold due to a high volume of ongoing projects and commitments.

1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education! <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 311 2014: It's all about community building. Which is about creating relationships, able to communicate and social interaction.

I as a student I am supposed to identify motivated youths who are looking to create direct careers. These students must be in their final year at High School or have graduated 6 months ago. Edoofa will then guide me in the steps. The credits allocation were stated
11/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 77 311 2014: Ok I'm waiting for the form

11/12/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 311 2014: Ok ok thank you
11/12/23, 9:00 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
11/12/23, 9:02 am - +263 77 311 2014: Splendid 👌
11/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*NIGEL/ADITI*
11/12/23, 9:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/12/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 311 2014: So in this group that's where I should add those who are interested?
11/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
11/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
11/12/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
11/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 311 2014: Ms Aditi I heard what you said but I am a little bit confused when you introduced that divisions. What are you really trying to mean when you say divisions
11/12/23, 9:19 am - Aditi Edoofa: That means different sections of the students in the A-level
11/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 311 2014: Ok then I understood
11/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 77 311 2014: Sorry my network is not stable

11/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/12/23, 9:25 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
11/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
11/12/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
