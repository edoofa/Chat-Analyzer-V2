16/08/23, 2:09 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Am listening 🎧
16/08/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _Through WhatsApp community groups_
16/08/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
16/08/23, 2:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

*Are you ready for the session*?
17/08/23, 1:35 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Yes 100% ready
17/08/23, 1:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you go through the audio?
17/08/23, 1:37 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Yes i did
17/08/23, 1:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
17/08/23, 1:51 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: For one to execute the project of community building, firstly one has to create a whatsapp group, after creating the group the next stage is to identify the right students who can be on that group. The main aim of this is to reach out to large number of students.To execute this one can start getting in touch with your school mates who have finished the e level education.After  alot of students hv joined the group you can therefore start sharing information of persuing your your dreams to India through edoofa .
17/08/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Patrick, I am impressed with your understanding.
17/08/23, 1:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
17/08/23, 1:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

29/08/23, 2:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin. <This message was edited>
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

01/09/23, 3:04 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Am following and I have been following all  your sessions but this task your trying to give Patrick it's Abit hard and more Challenging .

As young as he is should go around reaching headmasters of schools around and convincing them about Edoofa  i feel like it's not his job do that.

Am of the view that we were suppose to forcuss the way forward about registration and wat will happen wen the results of MALAWI SCHOOLS CERTICATE OF EDUCATION (MSCE)
01/09/23, 3:06 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: That's my suggestion as a Parent I feel like your now going out of subject  ,ldont know if am wrong
01/09/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I wanted to take a moment to discuss the notable benefits that your child can gain from reaching out to headmasters and professionals. As a mentor, it's my responsibility to guide and support your child's personal and academic development, and I believe that encouraging such interactions can greatly contribute to their future success.
01/09/23, 3:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: One of the most critical skills your child will require as they enter the professional world is confidence, coupled with effective communication skills.
01/09/23, 4:06 pm - +265 991 73 96 05: Well noted but my concern is that Patrick jnr do not have much knowledge about Edoofa he is in the process of learning , nowf it happens that he has been asked more and deep questions about EDOOFA  he will not manage to take them hence it will look embarrassed.

Unless if he could be accompanied by a competent  Edofian that will be better .But I agree confidence is more important
08/09/23, 12:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
I hope you are doing fine. I can understand your concern very well. But I would like to tell you that I will educate Patrick jnr will all the information nd will train him in advance before letting him execute the projects.

13/09/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well. Thank you for asking 😊
13/09/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let us continue with the messages that I shared yesterday.
13/09/23, 2:07 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Glad
13/09/23, 2:07 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Alright
13/09/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In Zimbabwe alone, EDOOFA has enrolled more than 1,500 students in the program within the last year. Collaborating with over 100 schools, including partnerships with esteemed educational leaders such as Mr. Shorwi Kawadza, Principal of Hartzell High School, Mutare, EDOOFA has witnessed the success of more than 80 students who have already embarked on their journey to study in India.
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: 🤝
13/09/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this, schools can benefit in the following ways:

13/09/23, 2:22 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: 🤝🤝
13/09/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
13/09/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
13/09/23, 3:10 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Alright

14/09/23, 1:52 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: Alright ms
14/09/23, 1:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
14/09/23, 1:57 pm - +265 981 30 88 42: 🤝
14/09/23, 1:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. I will get back to you on the Line.
