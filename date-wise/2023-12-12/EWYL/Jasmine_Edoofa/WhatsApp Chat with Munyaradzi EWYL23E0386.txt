On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 358 9903: Good morning Ms Jasmine Munyaradzi is Boarding were they    not allowed phones as per his email
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
18/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.

18/09/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 358 9903: if you can share so that we are on the same page
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Munyaradzi is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 358 9903: understood
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 358 9903: proceed
18/09/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.

18/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 358 9903: Thats no problem
18/09/23, 2:53 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.

18/09/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 358 9903: that sounds intriguing but since the student is not able to be  joining till 20 November 2023

18/09/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 358 9903: sure

1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week.

05/10/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, The sessions are only for the student. I would suggest you put the sessions on hold till 16th November and once Munyaradzi is back then he can continue with me. Will that be okay?
