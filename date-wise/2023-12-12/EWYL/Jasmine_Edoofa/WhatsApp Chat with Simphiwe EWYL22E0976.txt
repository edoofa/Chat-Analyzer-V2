29/08/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

11/10/23, 3:49 pm - +91 89685 82563: Good evening maam 


My exam was not that tough rather it was moderate and l think l did well 

My next exam is scheduled for tomorrow at 10 😁
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, let's have our discussion quickly so that you can make the most of your remaining study time.
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - +91 89685 82563: Yes maam
11/10/23, 3:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let's begin our session for today. First, kindly respond to the following questions with either "Yes" or "No":
1. Have you shared your photograph with me?
2. Have you provided your Facebook username?
3. Have you shared your Instagram username?
4. Have you written a review on Google and shared the screenshot with me?
5 Have you written a review on Facebook and shared the screenshot with me?
6. Have you shared your date of birth with me?
11/10/23, 4:00 pm - +91 89685 82563: 1. Yes
2. Yes
3. Yes
4. Yes
5. Yes
6. Yes
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 89685 82563: Yes maam l am doing so
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 4:15 pm - +91 89685 82563: Yes maam it is wise that we inform the students on how the programme functions
11/10/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 89685 82563: Understood
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - +91 89685 82563: So l shall submit the video once l am done with creating it
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 89685 82563: Yess maam
11/10/23, 4:20 pm - +91 89685 82563: So the video l will submit on friday will just be a mock up not a final video right
11/10/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Now it is time to wrap up the session. Make sure that you are on time from next time so that we can get the maximum benefits from the session. 

I wish you the best of luck with your exams.

Hello, my Proud Edoofian!

I hope this message finds you well. As part of our ongoing commitment to your personal and academic growth, we have scheduled a special activity for this Saturday that involves reflecting on your EWYL (Explore, Wonder, Yearn, Learn) projects.

During this activity, we kindly request each of you to make a small analysis of the input and output of the work you have done in your respective EWYL projects. This analysis should include insights into the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of your efforts. Feel free to share your successes and any unexpected discoveries you made.

Additionally, we encourage you to think about ways in which you can improve upon your results in future projects. This is an excellent opportunity to set goals for personal and academic development.

Remember, growth is a continuous process, and each project offers a valuable opportunity for improvement. We are excited to hear about your experiences and aspirations.
Best Regards
Ms. Jasmine
02/12/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Simphiwe, I wanted to reach out to you for a very special opportunity. 

Since you belong to Thekwane High School we feel that you are the right person to talk to your juniors of the same school.  

We would like to invite you to be the face of Edoofa in front of your schoolmates. As a token of our appreciation for your contribution, we are pleased to offer you a reward of $5 for every enrollment originating from Thekwane High School through your representation.

We will add you to the school group of Thekwane High and there you have to share your experience, how India is different from Africa, and what a student studying there should know what his/her journey will look like. 

May I know if are we on the same page and if are you ready to be added to your school group? <This message was edited>

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!
