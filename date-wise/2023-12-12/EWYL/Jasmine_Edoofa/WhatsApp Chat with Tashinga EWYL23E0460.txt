29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

08/09/23, 12:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organized. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?

11/09/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, I can understand Tashinga but don't you think that doing one thing at a time is better rather than doing it all at once? 
If you are coming for the session, Be present for the complete 60 minutes so that we can make the most out of it.
11/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 388 4330: I understand Ms Jasmine

14/09/23, 12:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tashinga and Parents 
How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
14/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 71 388 4330: Hello Ms Jasmine
15/09/23, 7:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
Yes, Tashinga. Please go ahead!
15/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 71 388 4330: I am under pressure maam its only 2 weeks to my final exams
15/09/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
17/09/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_* @263713884330 @263772720692 
I hope you are in great spirits. Since we have been connected for so long and we haven't recently completed our introduction about the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM. 

*So today since it is a Sunday, I have taken the initiative to conduct your session today so that you are not left behind.* 
The session is *scheduled today at 3:30 pm (African Time).* 
May I know if are you available?
19/09/23, 10:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon @263772720692 
I hope you are doing well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding an important matter related to Tashinga, where I have been serving as a mentor for a very long time. Moreover, there have been instances where Tashiga has missed several sessions.
19/09/23, 10:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I truly believe in Tashinga's potential, and I am committed to providing guidance and support. *However, I would like to kindly request your involvement and cooperation as well*. I believe that your input and encouragement would greatly benefit Tashinga's progress and development. I expect acknowledgment and cooperation.
19/09/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 272 0692: Hello how are you thank you so much for your concern but most of the times she will be at school especially with a few weeks remaining to start her examinations it's a bit difficult to make ends meet. Also due to some circumstances beyond our control it's difficult for us to raise the required amount to complete the process
19/09/23, 1:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Did you read this message of mine?
19/09/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 272 0692: I did but I will be at work
20/09/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tashinga
Can you select any of the option.
20/09/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: 1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
03/10/23, 1:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Tashinga*
I hope you are in great spirits. Finally, it's time to resume our session after such a long weekend. I am sure you will be as excited as I am. _*So, I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled with me for today from 1:30 p.m. onwards.*_

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
16/10/23, 8:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Tashinga and Parents* @263713884330 @263772720692 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
16/10/23, 8:55 am - +263 77 272 0692: Good morning  I'm at work right now not sure how much time the session session requires
16/10/23, 8:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I understand your concern, but if you actively participate in the sessions, they will typically last for about 30-45 minutes.
16/10/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 272 0692: What time will that be?
16/10/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: If you're currently available, we can begin right away.
16/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 272 0692: Ok it's fine
16/10/23, 9:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
