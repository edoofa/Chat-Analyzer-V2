I hope you are doing well.

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.

29/08/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 112 5423: So an EWYL program is a program that offers jobs to students as they learn so as to earn scholarship credits and it becomes easy for their expenses to be overcome
29/08/23, 8:48 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.

29/08/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 9:09 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
29/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 112 5423: 1. It provides some students with extra expenses, it provides accessible, affordable  and employable higher education. This program helps us achieve 21st century skills. And scholarship credits are earned helping lower expenses. 

2. Do an EWYL program is a program that offers jobs to students as they learn so as to earn scholarship credits and it becomes easy for their expenses to be overcome.

3. A student's journey with EWYL feels quiet easy since skills are learnt and acquired as well as expenses lowered.

4. One of the student's testimonials is that Edoofa has helped change lives through this EWYL program.
29/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 112 5423: Thank you maam
29/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 112 5423: Enjoy your festival

31/08/23, 8:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.

In this group, we have *Miss Deepali* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
31/08/23, 8:26 am - +263 77 112 5423: OK maam
31/08/23, 8:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
31/08/23, 8:27 am - +263 77 112 5423: OK maam
31/08/23, 8:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.
31/08/23, 8:28 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
31/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 112 5423: Yes maam
31/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 77 112 5423: OK maam
31/08/23, 8:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
31/08/23, 8:37 am - +263 77 112 5423: Ooo ok
31/08/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to tell me about what you have understood from the Program Structure.
Please go ahead.
31/08/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 112 5423: I understood that our sessions will be held from 8:30 _ 9:30 am from Monday to Friday. 
During our EWYL journey  we shall be meeting two days a week. It could be Mondays and Thursdays or Tuesdays and Fridays.
There is also what is known as the lesson of the week known as the Wednesday Wisdom, in which we will cover a skillet which will be followed by a weekend activity done on Saturday.
31/08/23, 8:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
18/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 754 1116: Okay  thank you

As per the epic Ramayana, Ravana had kidnapped Lord Rama's wife, Sita. This festival signifies the victory of righteousness (Rama) over malevolence (Ravana). Allow me to describe how I personally celebrated Dussehra.

Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
21/11/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 112 5423: Q1: St Killians Secondary school.  Yes it is connected with Edoofa
21/11/23, 9:39 am - +263 77 112 5423: Q2: My name is Nicole Tawananyasha Butawu, former school captain at St Killians. I have come here to let you know that l am a proud Edofian, meaning that  l was awarded a scholarship by the Edoofa program. I got the scholarship easily through the school in which l used to learn because it was connected to the Edoofa program already.  I just applied using my previous achievement grades and stating the name of the combination that l did and l got a scholarship together with the program already.


According to how l have known Edoofa has changed lives and therefore more lives still needs to be changed.

In short am saying don't you also want to connect with the Edoofa so that students from your school may also be awarded with scholarships? More lives needs this at your school as these students parents needs to be helped.
21/11/23, 9:40 am - +263 77 112 5423: Q3: Manicaland
21/11/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
21/11/23, 9:47 am - +263 77 112 5423: Yes l do agreee
21/11/23, 9:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.

Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact. <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 112 5423: Ok sure maam
21/11/23, 10:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
21/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 112 5423: Yes ready
