Kindly take advantage of this adjusted time and ensure you attend the session at 5:30 pm.

22/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes
22/11/23, 6:13 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
22/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 556 6776: No
22/11/23, 6:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a systematic program/curriculum in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Gugulethu is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
22/11/23, 6:24 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Understood
22/11/23, 6:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The second goal is to help all our edoofians self-finance their education, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
22/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted
22/11/23, 6:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the EWYL team. 
Ms.Sanjana is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted
22/11/23, 6:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have Ms. Davi, the Head coach with us, and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 

Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted
22/11/23, 6:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Gugulethu to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e. The student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared everaturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
22/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Noted ..
22/11/23, 6:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly newsletters as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, Mr. Angad Singh connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. 

Once Gugulethu forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
22/11/23, 6:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you gone through the newsletter?
22/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes  I'm done..sorry my netwk is bad

I hope you are doing well. I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled for today from 8:30 am onwards. 

*It is almost time for the session,* 
So are you ready?
24/11/23, 4:21 am - +263 71 556 6776: Good morning...I'm sorry couldn't connect yesterday we had a sudden network cutoff..
24/11/23, 7:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Morning Mrs. Moyo_*

01/12/23, 8:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning @263715566776 
I hope you are doing well.

I understand that you are a full-time teacher but I am asking you to be present only for 3 consecutive days from 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm. 
May I know will that be suitable for you?
01/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 71 556 6776: Morning...We closed schools today iam now available everyday any time up to the 9th of January 2024
01/12/23, 10:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great news. 
May I know that do you remember our past conversation?
01/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 71 556 6776: Yes
01/12/23, 12:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Gugulethu’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that Gugulethu's academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

How does that sound, Mrs. Moyo?
01/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Good
01/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. 
Will that be okay?
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 556 6776: Yes I'm ok
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options. First of all, I would like to know if is Gugulethu available for the sessions that will be held twice a week.
01/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 71 556 6776: She is available as from tomorrow

To proceed, I kindly advise you to create accounts on all these platforms

11/12/23, 9:25 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you have created accounts on these platforms, we can utilize their search features to identify companies that meet our criteria. For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.
