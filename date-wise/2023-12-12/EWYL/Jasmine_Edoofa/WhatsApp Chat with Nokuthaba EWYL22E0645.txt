Noted
17/08/23, 9:55 am - +91 76961 31143: Unfortunately my parents won't be able to attend, they are occupied the whole of this week..
I'll attend the meeting alone.
17/08/23, 1:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Nokuthaba. Thank you for the update.
17/08/23, 2:43 pm - +91 76961 31143: Yess
17/08/23, 2:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 2:51 pm - +91 76961 31143: Okay I understand
17/08/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - +91 76961 31143: Yess
17/08/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - +91 76961 31143: Grant is given to those students  who are committed in doing their projects and activities.

They attend their sessions consistently.
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +91 76961 31143: Thank you
17/08/23, 3:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - +91 76961 31143: Yess
17/08/23, 3:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:08 pm - +91 76961 31143: Okay...

Unfortunately, my parents attended a church program and it's out of time..their phones are out of battery by now..

17/08/23, 3:09 pm - +91 76961 31143: But I'll send the filled form by tomorrow evening
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Nokuthaba
17/08/23, 3:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 3:18 pm - +91 76961 31143: Okayy
17/08/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, May I know do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 76961 31143: No, I have no questions
17/08/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
17/08/23, 3:31 pm - +91 76961 31143: Thank you very much🙂

I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:25 pm - +91 76961 31143: Goodevening..

09/12/23, 7:30 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 7:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 4 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀
