3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
04/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 411 9566: Okay that's great
04/09/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

04/09/23, 9:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 411 9566: Well the audio was talking about me creating a WhatsApp group and adding students in my class and. After that I should create a group link in which I will spread to various groups and add a catchy phrase like "If you want to receive education at an affordable price may you kindly join the group. After that I should also add you as my mentor in the group so that you can monitor my progress in the group.
04/09/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well Done Takunda, I am impressed with your understanding.
04/09/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
04/09/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 411 9566: Thank you very much
04/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 411 9566: Okay
04/09/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
