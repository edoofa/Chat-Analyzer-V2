22/08/23, 2:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Esteemed Learner!
How are you?

It's an honor to have such dedicated students join me for this scheduled session

Let's delve into our subject matter with enthusiasm and curiosity
Are you ready for it?
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 233 2043: Yes I am
22/08/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great!
22/08/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So Tanyaradzwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
22/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 233 2043: My long term goal is to get a degree at a university in Business Administration in 4 years time.i would also want to go further with my studies and have a Masters.
The EWYL program will make my studies affordable by earning scholarship credits.
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So well said!
22/08/23, 2:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?
So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
22/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 233 2043: The Earn While You Learn program is an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before A level results are out. It helps to make higher education affordable. For instance, my annual fee is $2000 a year, if I manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month it means I can earn $1200 in a year and that would basically bring the cost further down to $800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accomodation. It is possible to get a handsome amount of scholarship credits through constant touch with my mentors for skill development and repeatedly asking for more projects and assignments to be done.
22/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses.
22/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.

It would be best if you allocate today's time to go through the attached document along with your family. It is essential that you read each and every detail attentively, taking your time to fully comprehend the information provided. So, are you ready for the document?
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Moreover, I would like to inform you that during tomorrow's session, I will be available to address any questions you may have. Therefore, it would be helpful if you could take note of any queries that arise while reading the documents. This way, we can ensure that tomorrow's session is both productive and tailored to your specific needs.
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: After you are done with the reading, I want you to answer some of my questions to the best of your ability. Our session tomorrow will provide an opportunity to discuss your responses, clarify any uncertainties, and delve deeper into the program's details.
22/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here are your questions

2. What is the EWYL program?

22/08/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The curtain falls on today's session!

          But remember, our daily endeavor to expand knowledge goes on.
          See you tomorrow
          Have a great day!
22/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 233 2043: Thank you.
22/08/23, 3:11 pm - +27 63 669 6130: Thank you Ma’am
22/08/23, 3:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: your welcome!
23/08/23, 2:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Warm Greetings, Student!

23/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 1. Edoofa Scholarship Program is beneficial as it offers free counselling session to students so that the can have access to the right information at the right time in their career planning. It is beneficial because of affordability through guaranteed scholarships. A candidate is guaranteed a minimum of 50-100% of their tution fee. Moreover, Edoofa is very beneficial as it assist in Visa processing for students. Edoofa focuses on preparing students for the real world. The EWYL program makes education affordable for Edoofians which reduces financial burden.
23/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 2. The Earn While You Learn Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. The EWYL program, therefore help the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs and tactics.
23/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 3. The student's journey with Edoofa Scholarship Program has:
1. Personalized career counselling
2. Eligibility check test and interview
3. Acceptance into the Edoofa program
4. Enrollment into the Edoofa program
5. Admission process after enrollment into the Edoofa program
6. Admission letter and Visa
23/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 4. I would want to write a testimony about Sikhululekile Mandizvidza a proud Edoofian. This is the information she shared

Sikhululekile Mandizvidza is a girl who comes from Guruve, Zimbabwe. She was introduced to Edoofa Scholarship Program by a student who was an Edoofian.

She testified that the Edoofa team are really nice people who are very patient and passionate with students. Sikhululekile mentioned that the EWYL stage was the most interesting as she was able to do school projects and look for other companies in cooperate align. From there, the Admissions office helped her to apply for university. She also testified that the EWYL program is very promising and reduces the financial burden by financing her education. Sikhululekile is very grateful because the Edoofa team has never left her side throughout the whole process until she reached India as her EWYL mentor communicated with her. Her mentor was really concerned about Sikhululekile's safety as she arrived in India in the evening. Up to now, Sikhululekile is really grateful as the Edoofa team continues to help her.

25/08/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/08/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 233 2043: The most interesting part for me was the *Edoofa Hall of Inspiration* because Mr Jecheche tells how to be a good and responsible leadera and also to be a good citizen. This section teaches how to acquire a set of skills at a young age.
25/08/23, 3:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?

    1. Corporate Alliances
    2. Community Building
    3. African Schools Education Reform Mission.
28/08/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 2. Project 1: Corporate Alliances
Under this project, I have understood that I should identify companies or organisations which are FinTech company, deal in payment system and mobile wallets. The companies should also have community-driven mobile platforms and are education technology companies. I'm also required to identify the decision makers of these organisations and reach out to them. I should also share Edoofa's message with the connections I have made. Moreover, I should arrange for a meeting or a video call with Edoofa and signing the contract once the professional ls I have reached agrees. Once this is all done, we create a Google sheet to record the processes of this project. The project will help me acquire good communication skills, building confidence and networking skills.
28/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 3. Project 2: Community Building
Under this project, I have understood that I will reach out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months and refer them to Edoofa program. I should fill the application forms of applicants. I have also understood that for every student that enrolls into the Edoofa program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, I will be getting $20 worth of scholarship credits.
28/08/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 3. Project 3: African Schools Education Reform Mission
Under this project, I have understood that I should reach out to local schools in the local region and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. I should share the reasons why Edoofa wants to help schools. This will help me aquire enduring skills and professional connections. On every successful call or email response by school to team Edoofa, $2 will be credited to my balance. Once the group or the process begins, I will be awarded with $10 worth of scholarship credits.
28/08/23, 2:05 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Dear Student, Welcome!
Hope you are doing well!

28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 233 2043: I learned about the ojectivesof Corporate Alliances which is to gain understanding of a market I plan to enter in the future and begin to prepare for it at an early age.

28/08/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 233 2043: From this document, I have understood that I should keep into consideration the nature of the company that can collaborate with Edoofa. The company must be either student-centric, recreational or it could be content-centric platform. I have also noted that the scale of the selected company should not be either too big or too small, keeping into consideration the employee size of the company. I have understood that companies so selected must be financially sound. Moreover, companies with a founder having a strong background in terms of experience and qualification is most suitable. I have also noted the platforms to use, that is, Google, LinkedIn l, Crunchbase, only to mention a few.

29/08/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 233 2043: Thank you👏
29/08/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

15/09/23, 9:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tanyaradzwa

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️
09/11/23, 11:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: *During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family*

 *I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023. We will have our session from 8:30am to 9:30am on Tuesday*
Kindly be available for the same. 
Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!
09/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 233 2043: Noted with thanks Ms Sharda, I hope you enjoy Diwali😊

15/11/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 233 2043: 1. The 3 projects are:
    1. Corporate Alliances
    2. Community Building
    3. African Schools Education Reform Mission.
15/11/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 233 2043: 2. Project 1: Corporate Alliances
Under this project, I have understood that I should identify companies or organisations which are FinTech company, deal in payment system and mobile wallets. The companies should also have community-driven mobile platforms and are education technology companies. I'm also required to identify the decision makers of these organisations and reach out to them. I should also share Edoofa's message with the connections I have made. Moreover, I should arrange for a meeting or a video call with Edoofa and signing the contract once the professional ls I have reached agrees. Once this is all done, we create a Google sheet to record the processes of this project. The project will help me acquire good communication skills, building confidence and networking skills.
15/11/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 233 2043: 3. Project 2: Community Building
Under this project, I have understood that I will reach out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months and refer them to Edoofa program. I should fill the application forms of applicants. I have also understood that for every student that enrolls into the Edoofa program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, I will be getting $20 worth of scholarship credits.
15/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 233 2043: 3. Project 3: African Schools Education Reform Mission
Under this project, I have understood that I should reach out to local schools in the local region and speak to the decision makers to collaborate with Edoofa. I should share the reasons why Edoofa wants to help schools. This will help me aquire enduring skills and professional connections. On every successful call or email response by school to team Edoofa, $2 will be credited to my balance. Once the group or the process begins, I will be awarded with $10 worth of scholarship credits.
15/11/23, 8:35 am - +27 63 669 6130: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Providence*
In the spirit of our session today, I'd like to share this simple yet powerful quote: 'Believe you can, and you're halfway there.' – Theodore Roosevelt. As we delve into our discussions, let's carry the confidence that our efforts and collaboration will pave the way for success.

15/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 233 2043: I learned about the ojectives of Corporate Alliances which is to gain understanding of a market I plan to enter in the future and begin to prepare for it at an early age. I have learned how to look for organisations through LinkedIn. I will be provided with a document that addresses common questions. This will help me with increase credibility.
15/11/23, 1:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Tanyaradzwa. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you.

15/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 233 2043: From this document, I have understood that I should keep into consideration the nature of the company that can collaborate with Edoofa. The company must be either student-centric, recreational or it could be content-centric platform. I have also noted that the scale of the selected company should not be either too big or too small, keeping into consideration the employee size of the company. I have understood that companies so selected must be financially sound. Moreover, companies with a founder having a strong background in terms of experience and qualification is most suitable. I have also noted the platforms to use, that is, Google, LinkedIn l, Crunchbase, only to mention a few.

17/11/23, 9:27 am - +263 77 233 2043: From this project I have understood that Community building refers to a process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships and shed identities among individuals within a particular group. The goal of the project is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction and participation in shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and learn how to use social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoofian education ecosystem and acquire international education that helps them prepare them for the future.To successful complete this project, students will reach out to African students who have graduated from senior secondary schools either recently or in the past 6 months and refer them to Edoofa program. I should fill the application forms of applicants. I have also understood that for every student that enrolls into the Edoofa program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, I will be getting $20 worth of scholarship credits. On the completion of the admissions formalities of university, students will be get $30 worth scholarships credits. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of scholarship credits per student that Edoofa team connects with student for clarity on the program

20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
20/11/23, 2:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now it’s time to wrap up our session.

I've noticed that you have not been active throughout our session today. I was waiting for you to reply.

Please understand that consistent participation is crucial for maximizing the benefits of our discussions. I understand various factors may contribute to this, but I encourage you to prioritize continuous presence moving forward. I look forward to your active presence in upcoming sessions.

21/11/23, 8:29 am - +263 77 233 2043: From this I understood that I have to create a WhatsApp group and identify the right students who can be part of Edoofa. The goal is to reach to many students and give information about Edoofa before the counseling sessions and ensure they have a smooth experience. To find the right students, I can get in touch with students who are currently in form 6 or those who have passed their form 6. I have to make sure I enter an unofficial Whatsapp group and share my WhatsApp group link in their group. In this group I will be sharing information about exciting opportunity of studying in India with 50-100% intuition fee. I can repeat the process to other individuals. Before I start interacting with students from Community building, I will make sure I add Ms Sharda as my mentor in the WhatsApp group so that she tracks my progress and provide guidance in networking skills. I should ensure the right information has been shared to the students.
21/11/23, 8:30 am - +263 77 233 2043: Greetings Ms Sharda, how are you doing?

1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

29/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 233 2043: From this project I understood that it gives students an opportunity to make their teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the Edoofa program. I should reach out to local schools headmasters and inform them about Edoofa program. I should tell them why I joined Edoofa and how I planned my future and also share the program details. I should ask them if they would like an online meeting with the Edoofa program director. I can share the contact details of the principal with my EWYL mentor.
29/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 233 2043: I can't wait too.
Have a great day ahead

I aspire to be a Human resources manager at a highly esteemed company or organisation in 5 years time
30/11/23, 2:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.


Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
30/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 233 2043: 3. My school is located in Harare Province

30/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 233 2043: I am following
30/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.*
30/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
30/11/23, 2:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
