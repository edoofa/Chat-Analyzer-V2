As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Tuesday (24th of October) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
25/10/23, 8:05 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Afternoon Tinashe

My name is Sharda, and you can refer to me as Ms. Sharda. As your EWYL mentor, I am committed to helping you make the most of our journey together in the EWYL program.

I would like to schedule a session with you today i.e. 25-10-2023 from 8:30 am to 9:30 am, during which we can have a productive discussion.
May I know if you are comfortable with the timings?
25/10/23, 8:06 am - Sharda Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for the delay in reply. I was unavailable due to few health concerns.
25/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 271 6627: Greetings. How are you Sharda. This is Munashe,  Tinashe's father
25/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 77 271 6627: Tinashe is not available since use of cellphones is not allowed at boarding schools this side
01/11/23, 8:35 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello *Tinashe*! 🌟

Let's kick off our regular session with a little inspiration:

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." - Lao Tzu

No matter where you are on your path, remember that every step you take today brings you closer to your goals. Let's make this session a productive and rewarding one together
01/11/23, 8:39 am - +263 77 271 6627: Hello. Thanks for the inspiration
01/11/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/11/23, 8:44 am - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
01/11/23, 8:47 am - +263 77 271 6627: I think  i need your explanation on the objectives
01/11/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Tinashe* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
01/11/23, 8:48 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
01/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 271 6627: Well understood
01/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
01/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
01/11/23, 8:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
01/11/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 271 6627: Thanks for the introduction. It will be good connecting with these professionals
01/11/23, 9:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Tinashe* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
01/11/23, 9:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Tinashe* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
01/11/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 271 6627: I have read its inspiring
01/11/23, 10:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Tinashe*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Tinashe* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically!
01/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 271 6627: Well set goals thank you
01/11/23, 2:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Tinashe* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
01/11/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 271 6627: Document received let me go through it

02/11/23, 7:18 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Tinashe

07/11/23, 1:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good day! Let's kick off our session with some inspiration: 'Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success. If you love what you are doing, you will be successful.' – Albert Schweitzer. With this in mind, let's embark on a productive and fulfilling session.

08/12/23, 8:31 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Tinashe

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.

08/12/23, 9:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE

This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort. It reminds us that our individual abilities may be limited, but when we unite and work together, our potential becomes boundless. Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.

Let's make this session a testament to the incredible achievements possible when we join forces.
11/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 764 8324: Ok

11/12/23, 8:38 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:39 am - Sharda Edoofa: After you go through the audio, I would appreciate it if you could briefly share your understanding of the audio.

11/12/23, 8:50 am - +263 78 764 8324: Sorry you said edoofian have self communicative...what?
11/12/23, 8:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share the written information about the project.
11/12/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: All the Edoofians have a great sense of community building. The term community building refers to the process of establishing and strengthening connections, relationships, and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community. This involves creating a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals feel a sense of belonging and are able to collaborate, communicate and work toward common goals. The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesive community that promotes social interaction, and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and ownership towards achieving collective success.

 This shared belief is the core of our second project which is community building. The primary outcome of this project is for students to develop networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoufian's educational ecosystem and acquire international education that prepares them for the future. By reaching out to personal and extended networks, students will identify motivated youths who are looking to create great careers and direct them toward this opportunity.

 This project also encourages students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly to create an impact in the lives of others. To successfully complete this project, students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from senior secondary schools, completed their secondary education, or are currently in the final year of senior secondary education. As a member of Team EDUFA, students will be expected to use their networking and persuasion skills to refer the students to the program and help the organization grow.

 Throughout the project, Edoofa will provide guidance and support to ensure that the students are successful in their efforts. The referral generation project for Edoofa provides students with the opportunity to earn scholarship credits by referring their personal and extended networks to the Edoofa program. For every student that enrolls and pays the first part of the enrollment fee, the referring student will receive $20 worth of scholarship credits. Upon completion of the admission formalities of the university,

The referring student will receive $30 worth of scholarship credits. In addition, there is an opportunity to earn an extra $5 worth of scholarship credits for every student that the Edoofa team connects with the referring student for clarification on the program.

11/12/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great.
11/12/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
11/12/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
11/12/23, 9:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
