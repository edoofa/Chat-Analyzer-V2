I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 11:14 am - +263 71 736 9962: I understand the terms and conditions
14/08/23, 2:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Tomorrow, India will be celebrating its Independence Day. In observance of this significant national event, our headquarters will be closed for the day. As a result, there will be no scheduled sessions on this day.

I will see you on Wednesday.
14/08/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 736 9962: Ok thank you ma'am
15/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 736 9962: Happy Independence day Ms Tenzin
16/08/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 736 9962: Thank you ma'am
16/08/23, 10:20 am - +91 78273 08969: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 736 9962: I'm ready
16/08/23, 10:21 am - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 736 9962: Very true 🤝
16/08/23, 10:24 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 736 9962: No
16/08/23, 10:31 am - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 736 9962: I understand no and I'm very happy to receive this grant
16/08/23, 10:34 am - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 736 9962: Very true
16/08/23, 10:56 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 10:56 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 10:57 am - +263 71 736 9962: Ok thank you ma'am I have to go through it
16/08/23, 11:03 am - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 736 9962: My parents are not around as soon as they get back home I'll share with you their thoughts
16/08/23, 11:09 am - +91 78273 08969: Okay, As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

18/10/23, 3:54 pm - +91 76819 56989: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes this is the one.
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let's talk about something important - *the quality of referrals*. 
Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  -
18/10/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.
18/10/23, 3:58 pm - +91 76819 56989: Understood
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
18/10/23, 4:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
18/10/23, 4:01 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*

18/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 76819 56989: So far no challenges it only took about a week for me to understand the accent . Nowadays I can clearly understand the teachers
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It's great to hear that your academics are on track. If you're facing challenges with certain subjects, don't hesitate to reach out for assistance. We're here to support you. As for your upcoming exams, make sure to prepare well and stay focused.

25/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening, Tadiwanashe!

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 76819 56989: Good evening ma'am. Yes ma'am I'm really excited about this grant
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am I remember
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excellent Tadiwanashe, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am I remember the guidelines
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Yes ma'am I remember
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 328 8720: I understand
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Very true. Thank you ma'am
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome.
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Understood
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 3:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	4/6
Attendance	5/6
Orientation	Absent
Fee status	Clear
27/11/23, 3:18 pm - +91 76819 56989: Orientation I was present
27/11/23, 3:20 pm - +91 76819 56989: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - +91 76819 56989: This was the orientation day when Ms Saloni and Ms Jasmine with Mr Rithvik and Mr Saga visited Quest
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Tadiwanashe, thank you for sharing the update.
27/11/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 3:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance.
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am very motivational I believe I can do that too
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sharda Edoofa: yes!
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it

27/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Sharda Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Very true 🤝
29/11/23, 7:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Good morning Tadiwanashe*

09/12/23, 1:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Tadiwanashe

As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
09/12/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Very true
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.

For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.

So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.
09/12/23, 1:38 pm - +91 76819 56989: Yes ma'am 🤝
09/12/23, 1:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Could you guess the answer beforehand ?
09/12/23, 1:44 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Before we move forward, I would like you to submit your understanding of the Wednesday Lesson that was shared with you on wednesday*
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - +91 76819 56989: Understood let me share my understanding
09/12/23, 1:56 pm - +91 76819 56989: I learned about the benefits of Microsoft excel for me as a college student. The benefits are data organization, creating visually appealing graphs and charts that can enhance presentations. It also enhances my analytical abilities which are vulnerable in various academic disciplines and future career paths. I also learnt about the features on Microsoft excel
09/12/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Fantastic! It's evident that you've grasped the practical benefits of Microsoft Excel for a college student. Recognizing its role in data organization, as well as the ability to create visually appealing graphs and charts for presentations, showcases a valuable understanding. The enhancement of analytical abilities across academic disciplines and future career paths is a noteworthy takeaway. Additionally, acknowledging and learning about the various features in Microsoft Excel reflects a comprehensive exploration of the software.

09/12/23, 2:08 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let's also explore the progress of the projects you've been actively engaged in. Let's start with the Community Building Project.
In this initiative, you're reaching out to build a community and share Edoofa opportunities. 


How's it going? I'm keen to know how many students have you interacted with? 
What are the problems or challenges that you are facing?
09/12/23, 2:10 pm - +91 76819 56989: I have interacted with many students from my former school and they have been enrolled through the school
09/12/23, 2:11 pm - +91 76819 56989: But for now I have 1 student who is going through counseling session
09/12/23, 2:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I appreciate your dedication to the Edoofa Scholarship community building project and understand the challenge posed by students awaiting their results. In this specific context, it's imperative to tailor our approach to cater to their needs. Here's a logical and practical call to action:

    Engage in Pre-Decision Information Sessions:
        Organize specialized pre-decision information sessions for students who are awaiting their results. Focus on providing them with in-depth insights into the Edoofa Scholarship program, including eligibility criteria, benefits, and the application process. Ensure that the sessions are recorded so that those unable to attend live can access the information later.
09/12/23, 2:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Individualized Guidance Sessions:*
Offer one-on-one guidance sessions for students who express interest. During these sessions, address any specific concerns they may have and provide personalized advice based on their academic backgrounds and aspirations. This approach demonstrates the individualized support that Edoofa offers.

*Timeline Alignment and Flexibility:*
Clearly communicate the flexibility within the Edoofa application timeline. Assure students that the scholarship program is designed to accommodate varying academic calendars and that decisions can be made at a pace that aligns with their results announcement.

*Highlight Transition Success Stories:*
Share success stories of students who successfully transitioned into the Edoofa program while awaiting their results. Illustrate how these individuals navigated a similar situation and emphasize the positive outcomes they achieved through the scholarship.
09/12/23, 2:26 pm - +91 76819 56989: Very true and I have played a role in encouraging some of the students who have joined Edoofa trough other sources and enlightening them more about Edoofa
09/12/23, 2:27 pm - +91 76819 56989: Very true 🤝
09/12/23, 3:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Great Tadiwanashe.
09/12/23, 3:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Now that the time is over, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session*.

And make sure that you share the Application forms and updates on school projects with me.
09/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 328 8720: Understood. Have a good day ma'am
11/12/23, 5:40 am - +91 76819 56989: Good morning Ms Sharda. Is it possible for a student to come and study in India without going for A level
11/12/23, 8:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Tadiwanashe
I hope you are doing well

Yes, sure the student can very well get admission in the diploma courses if he/she has not completed the A level examination and it is very much possible to come and study here in India.
11/12/23, 8:32 am - +91 76819 56989: Ok thank you ma'am
11/12/23, 8:41 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
