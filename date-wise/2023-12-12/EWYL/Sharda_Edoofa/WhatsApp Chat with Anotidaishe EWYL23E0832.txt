08/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Thank you
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Anotidaishe
It clearly shows that you have read the document in detail. Keep it Up!✈️
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE*
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: very quickly summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 908 6558: It is taking time to load!
08/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Do you mind resending the audio?

08/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Still, It's failing to download
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright Anotidaishe, in this case I suggest you to move to a place of more stable internet connection.
08/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Managed to download, now listening.
08/11/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Project is a task to me to link Edoofa with influential organizations within my country. This I can do by creating a Linkdn account that will assist me in communicating with the managers and decision makers of local companies. I will have to share meeting details with them and Edoofa team. This Task will go a long way in building internship basis and maybe even a employable base for myself. This also goes a long way in making a difference in the Edoofa community
08/11/23, 3:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Anotidaishe. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

Due to recent developments, we have decided to put Project 1, the Corporate Alliance Project, on hold for now. As a result, I kindly request that you cease any work or activities related to Project 1. We will revisit and resume the project at a later date.
In the meantime, we have two projects for you to embark upon - Project 2 (Community Building)  and Project 3 (African School Education Reform Mission). These projects present fantastic opportunities for you to showcase your skills, earn scholarship credits, and make a significant impact.🪄
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 2: COMMUNITY BUILDING*
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move to the next project! This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Anotodaishe!
21/11/23, 1:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 908 6558: It’s up to us edoofians to enhance our community. We have been presented with an opportunity to success and so we need to be the ones to also present it to others so that we build our community. 

For me to earn credits, I have to share knowledge about The Edoofa program to those that have finished high school or are currently in their final year, for every applicant that registers I gain $20 worth of credits and for every applicant that successfully complete university formality I earn $30 worth of credits. Furthermore I have an opportunity to earn extra $5 credits for every student that the edoofa team connects with that I have referred
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That’s awesome- Anotidaishe, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team.
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project. Are you ready?
21/11/23, 2:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, You have to share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they deserve to be Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

_Through WhatsApp community groups_

Kindly go through the audio that I am sharing below, After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
21/11/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Okay so basically it’s to get a large pool of people with one move which is to create a WhatsApp group where anyone who’s interested in joining edoofa gets added into the group and to them I share relevant information about the program and assist on which routes they can take to apply. You’re also supposed to be in this group to monitor progress
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Well Done Anotidaishe, I am impressed with your understanding.
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, this is how you have to make sure that the application form is filled
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This is very valuable information that you can definitely use while communicating with the students. Do you agree?
21/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Yes I agree
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: PROJECT 3: AFRICAN SCHOOL EDUCATION REFORM MISSION PROJECT
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You too have a good day!
23/11/23, 1:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Greetings Anotidaishe*
I hope you are doing well

You have a session scheduled today at *1:30 pm*. Kindly confirm your availability for the same.
23/11/23, 2:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that it is our session time are you ready for it?
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I'm quite let down because you didn't show up for your scheduled session today without giving me any prior notice. I hope you understand how crucial these sessions are, and it's essential to be consistent in attending them.
23/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 908 6558: I am very aware, my apologies for today. I'll strike a balance between my school time and these sessions. However it would be very helpful if we move this sessions to a later time if possible
23/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 908 6558: My situation is as follows:
I am a student and I attend school from 8 AM to 3.30 PM, *CAT*, meaning I can only be available for these sessions when I arrive home at 4 PM. Previously I have managed to attend sessions from time to time in instances where schools would have ended as early as 1PM. At school, we are not allowed to carry cellphones so I can only access my cellphone after school times when I have arrived home. If you are to move the sessions to any time above 4PM then I can be able to attend but as of now, any time before 4PM I am unavalaible
07/12/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening Anotidaishe
I hope you are doing well.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to get back to you immediately. There has been some technical glitch in my device which restricted our communication. 
But do not worry about it now.
07/12/23, 4:27 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is completely alright; I can completely understand it. Thank you so much for informing me about it.
07/12/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to communicate your availability and concerns. Your dedication to both your academic pursuits and our Earn While You Learn (EWYL) sessions is commendable.
07/12/23, 4:34 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Understanding the constraints of your school schedule and the cellphone policy, I want to ensure that our EWYL sessions remain a valuable supplement to your learning without causing any undue stress. It's crucial to strike a balance between your academic commitments and the additional learning opportunities we provide.
07/12/23, 4:35 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Considering your limited availability before 4 PM CAT, I propose a slight adjustment to our session structure. Instead of two sessions a week, we can consolidate into a single, longer session. This session can be scheduled at a time convenient for you, preferably on saturdays when you have access to your cellphone.
07/12/23, 4:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: During this consolidated session, we can delve into the ongoing projects, discuss any challenges or questions you may have, and strategize for the week ahead. This way, you won't miss out on any school learning, and you can provide comprehensive updates on the progress of your EWYL projects.
07/12/23, 4:36 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I trust that this arrangement will not only accommodate your school schedule but also enhance the quality of our interactions. It's crucial that you promise to commit dedicated effort to the projects and actively engage during our weekly session.

Let me know if this proposed adjustment aligns with your schedule and expectations. I'm here to support your academic and professional growth, and I believe this modified approach will be mutually beneficial.
07/12/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 908 6558: Thank you for your understanding. These adjustments can work for me. Since the sessions will be longer is it possible they be evening sessions
08/12/23, 7:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Anotidaishe
I hope you are doing well

Thank you for the update, yes sure I will let you know the timing for the same.

08/12/23, 1:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon, Anotidaishe
As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.* 
I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
09/12/23, 12:49 pm - +263 78 908 6558: You had said you’ll update me on the times we are to meet that also respect the timetable that I have
11/12/23, 7:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Anotidaishe
