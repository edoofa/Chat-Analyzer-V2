Keep it up !
21/08/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Question 4.
A testimony l can say is of twins that signed up for the program after being introduced to it by their headmistress at school .they went through the eligibility test which they said it was quite easy for them cause it was a matter of them calming down and think about it and their future ahead .After the test they did the Earn While You Learn programs with Miss  Saloni as their great , supportive and understanding mentor ,. Before that they also had an awesome consoler who was also patient with them through the whole journey .And of course the admission team welcomed them at the airport and still continued to support them in India
21/08/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.
In this group, we have *Miss Deepali* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
21/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.

The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
21/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. It's crucial that we have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.

Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm from Monday to Friday*
21/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
21/08/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted

21/08/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Good Job*, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

Here is the message -
16/09/23, 8:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!

16/09/23, 8:22 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this point, I couldn’t stop myself but tell you that Edoofa is also working closely in collaboration with the Zimbabwean Ambassador to India Dr. G.M Chipare. We have had meetings where Dr. Chipare has recommended the Program offer Scholarships to 10,000 Zimbabweans within 3 years. Here with I have attached the photo from our meetings with him.

Are you ready for an enriching learning experience ?
21/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Yes I am
21/09/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is not connected* with Edoofa:
21/09/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
21/09/23, 2:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the *School is connected* with Edoofa:
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is good to see that your school is already a part of our family. Now, I believe it would be beneficial for other schools to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Agree
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
21/09/23, 2:12 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
21/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_
21/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I am writing to share some exciting news and a wonderful opportunity that I believe could greatly benefit your students at [School Name]
21/09/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 121 8434: Agree
21/09/23, 2:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have been selected as a recipient of the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program, which will allow me to pursue higher education in India.

Excuse me for we could not connect yesterday for our session.

Monday was a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.
