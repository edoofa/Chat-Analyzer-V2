As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"
Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
08/12/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes that's true and motivating as well
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I think an echo  the answer to that question
08/12/23, 1:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, the riddle's answer is an echo. Just like an echo, our actions reverberate in the world, shaping the narrative of our lives. Steve Jobs' quote underscores the importance of finding passion and purpose in our endeavors. It's not just about going through the motions; it's about doing work that resonates with your inner self.
For you, remarkable young students, this is the time to explore, to discover what makes your heartbeat faster. Your journey is not just about grades and achievements; it's about finding the echoes of your passion and letting them guide you toward a future filled with great work.
So, let's dive into today's session with enthusiasm and curiosity, ready to uncover the echoes that will shape your extraordinary journey.

08/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Thanks for the information
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 78 068 4943: The EWYL also gives me guidance from you as mentors, so that as students  we are able to  earn a higher amount of scholarship credits  through undertaking different projects and assignments, which also improves our performance and gives us credits to use for financial payments to be paid
08/12/23, 2:28 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education.

Here are your questions 
1. What are the benefits of the Edoofa Scholarship program?
2. What is the EWYL program? 
3. What does a student’s journey look like with the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
08/12/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 4. Write in detail about one of the student’s testimonials.
08/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
08/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now let me introduce you to the EWYL team.
In this group, we have *Miss Sanjana* She is the Head of the Department and all group conversations will be monitored by her and she will always be there whenever we need her guidance.
She is not online right now, but she will definitely be connecting with you soon on this amazing journey.
08/12/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Miss Davi*, the Head Coach with us. She is not in the group but she will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum and we will be hearing from her once every week.
08/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Greetings to you all the EWYL team
08/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright , thanks for introducing the team members
08/12/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The whole team will now ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL program and all your progress will be evaluated regularly so your active participation is very crucial for us to help you.
08/12/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome please.
08/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Okay ,  l understand
08/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to provide you with some important information regarding our *PROGRAM STRUCTURE* moving forward. We must have a clear understanding of our schedule to ensure effective learning and progress.

Please note that the following schedule will be implemented once we have completed our current phase of learning about all the projects.
08/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 8:30 a.m. to 9:30 a.m. from Monday to Friday*
08/12/23, 2:45 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey

1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
08/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright I'll be there for the sessions as programmed
08/12/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Alright, great.
08/12/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.
08/12/23, 2:49 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

08/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I've gone through the newsletters
08/12/23, 3:02 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
08/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , that's true but  among all the sections l think the second part QUESTIONS FOR YOU is the best
08/12/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, I can totally agree to that.
08/12/23, 3:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
08/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , they all give inspiration and life lessons though
08/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , that's very true
08/12/23, 3:12 pm - +263 78 068 4943: I've noticed , it also gave me the real idea about what l should do as an Edoofian
08/12/23, 3:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, you are very right. Prosper.
08/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Alright
08/12/23, 3:21 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, we’re ready to begin your EWYL program, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me.

This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
08/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I want you to take today’s time, to go through the document, read about each, and every project in detail, and then answer some of my questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?

08/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Same to you , thank you for your time
08/12/23, 3:24 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome please.
08/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 068 4943: 1)The scholarship helps me to pay for tuition fees. It also helps me  get  a chance to study at a prestigious university,  through reducing the expenses for higher education.Edoofascholarship program supports our efforts through their Earn While You Learn program which gives scholarship credits .It also makes us employable after we finish university level through their empowerment so that we become competent enough to get good jobs.
2)The EWYL program is when Edoofians are given different tasks and part-time projects  to be undertaken so as to develop skills while learning as well .These projects come from influential organisations and volunteering with organisations . Consistency during the program earns  scholarship credits , which financially helps students on achieving their higher education affordably.Students also gain supervised practical experience when they work as interns  in leading companies .They also gain the ability of leadership through mentoring other young students and making connections .The program also allows volunteering in many opportunities provided , gaining experience and recognition.There is also skill development through workshops in particular fields , industry events  which improves techniques and skills.
3)Our journey with Edoofa  is a long way in which  we find it difficult as we start but feel free to ask for assistance from Edoofa members as we move forward.a
As for me , l made a lot of application forms  for the Edoofa scholarship program till the board reached out to me.All the counseling sessions went well as  we discussed more about how the scholarship program works and how it helps as well as the reasons why l chose to be part of it.The interviews were sometimes hard but l can say l managed to work on them and l was accepted as an Edoofian .I was given the Statement Of Purpose and l did it easily.Now l am working on how to undertake the projects of the EWYL program and to proceed with my preparations for what comes
 afterwards 
4)l've seen some two twin sisters from this other family , which l have forgot the family name, but they really gave a good explanation their success having a chance to get a scholarship through Edoofa and how proud they were as a family.They explained their experience in the process as they start with applications and get excitement after the board members replied to them.They also thought that it will be hard for them on the interviews but they said that they were given guidance and assistance in the sessions , which helped them to achieve their scholarship and now they are both  doing their programs very well with the help of Edoofa members and helping others to trust the process as well
08/12/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 068 4943: 1) Project 1-Corporate Alliances
Project 2-Community Building
Project 3-African Schools Education Reform Mission
2)It is about building good communication skills with businesses, representing Edoofa to partner companies and being able to reach out to influential people with confidence and always keep trying to get help no matter how difficult it becomes.This is done through identifying local companies through the internet as well as identifying the decision makers of those companies and then sharing Edoofa's message with the connections.A meeting is then arranged through a video call  and signing up the contract and  reporting through the whole activity online
3)It helps to build connections with the society people as well as with several students in surrounding areas as the network is extended and the Edoofa members will help creating a strategy to reach out to the entire network where information about Edoofa is shared , and there are more scholarship credits earned as the EWYL goes on
4)A list of high schools including mine as well, are identified through Linkdin and my personal network , these people are then reached out with messages and emails with the help of Edoofa and this creates connection between them and Edoofa .This will be a fast way to connect the decision makers in those high schools and Edoofa .There are also scholarship credits earned as from all other projects
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon Prosper
"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." - Helen Keller
This powerful quote by Helen Keller encapsulates the essence of collaboration and collective effort. It reminds us that our individual abilities may be limited, but when we unite and work together, our potential becomes boundless. Today, let's embrace the strength that lies in our unity and forge ahead towards shared success.
Let's make this session a testament to the incredible achievements possible when we join forces.

11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *PROJECT 1: CORPORATE ALLIANCE*

11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 068 4943: The first project is about corporate alliance with an objective to get ready by understanding the future market that we plan to be as young people which is much based on digital online network , so the task is to identify those companies, starting with the current network we use in our family , which is used by parents of my friends who work in that sector and even our neighbors as well so that we build new skills through sharing the objectives that are planned for us by Edoofa in preparation for employability .Also creating a LinkedIn account downloaded from the app store , which is a networking app which allows to search for the companies and it's employees so that we can reach out to managers making conversations and gathering information to set up meetings for Edoofa and sharing the meetings afterwards
11/12/23, 3:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Amazing, thanks. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it.

11/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 78 068 4943: Yes , thanks for that
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You can go through the audio after our session today.
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are most welcome.
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Sharda Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about-
1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.  
Here is the message -
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Friends

I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 

I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.

Best of Luck!
