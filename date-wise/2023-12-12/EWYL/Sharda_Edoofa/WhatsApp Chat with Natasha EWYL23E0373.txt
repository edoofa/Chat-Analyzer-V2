For the time being, *Our sessions will be held every day from 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm from Monday to Friday*
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, During your EWYL Journey
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You will be meeting me two days a week. It can be either Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday.
2. You will be getting the lesson of the week, or as we call it *Wednesday Wisdom*, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity which I will share on Saturday.
17/08/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
17/08/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: This message was deleted

You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

28/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
28/08/23, 2:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

28/08/23, 3:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: your welcome please!
29/08/23, 2:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello, Curious Mind!
I hope you are doing well

Your eagerness to learn is infectious, and I'm excited to explore new concepts and ideas with you

Let's make this session a place where questions lead to discoveries
Are you ready for it?
29/08/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 3555094: Yes, I am ready to begin
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: How to excel in the project?

SET 1: 

Since you are facing challenges connecting with Headmasters, what we can do is:
1) I can share some contact details with you of those Schools that were earlier not responsive to us with whom you can establish a connection again
2) You can try searching for schools on Google
-Let me share with you how our star performer for the last week-Loice did complete her targets.
She shared three schools and you know she got to know about them through Google.
She simply searched on Google like 'School nearby'/'School in Harare'/'School in Manicaland' and so on. She was able to yield results. 
So even without physically visiting them, she got to know about them through Google, got their contact details, and after that got in touch with them Via WhatsApp.
3)  please reach out to all your friends, peers, cousins, neighbors, school mates, to get their School Head's contact details.
4)  visit schools in your province, physical visits can add another touch to the conversations and make them a lot more impactful.
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: SET 2 
This is one of my students named Munyaradzi, who has visited more than 20 schools in his locality and interacts with the headmasters, teachers, and students there. He explains to them about Edoofa and the perks of being associated with such a prestigious scholarship organization. Over this time, he shared more than 20 forms every week and at least one school form. There is no comparison among the students but with this example, I would let you know three things:
  ▪️With consistency and efforts made in the right direction, you can surely achieve success 
  ▪️Visiting schools physically can put a lot of impact on the students and school heads and make it very convincing for them.
  ▪️With this, he has surely gained a lot of confidence, compelling skills, leadership quality, and yes, he has surely overcome the fear to present himself spontaneously and his family Edoofa, in front of anyone at any point.
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, *Natasha*- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
29/08/23, 2:54 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
29/08/23, 3:07 pm - +260 96 3555094: I am very excited
29/08/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
29/08/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
29/08/23, 3:22 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
29/08/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
29/08/23, 3:23 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, Natasha, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
29/08/23, 3:24 pm - +260 96 3555094: Thank you, noted
29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So Natasha, There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
29/08/23, 3:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
29/08/23, 3:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 


Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.


I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.

31/08/23, 2:18 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
31/08/23, 2:41 pm - +260 96 3555094: Yes i am ready to begin
31/08/23, 2:43 pm - +260 96 3555094: And sorry for the late respond
31/08/23, 2:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It is alright dear, noted.
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: U look amazing dear!
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I would like to inform you that we are ready to begin our new journey.
*Please note a few things:*

*FIRST*- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 

*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*

*SECOND*- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

*THIRD*- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
Edoofa EWYL (contact):  *+91 98107 89170*

*FOURTH*- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, *Ms. Sharda*, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

*FIFTH*- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
31/08/23, 2:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
01/09/23, 9:47 am - +260 96 6414725: Good Morning Ms Sharda. This is Natasha speaking. I  kindly wanted to inform you that I will be leaving for school on Monday, 4th September, to continue my secondary education.I will be writing my final examination  in the month of November .

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:25 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:57 pm - +260 96 6414725: Good evening

I hope everything's going well with your exam preparations. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here to support you all the way until your exams are done. If you need any help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
