26/09/23, 11:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Mazviita! You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects.

27/09/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 71 686 5384: Thank you very much Ms Ananya .Hope we will have a wonderful journey together
27/09/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
27/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 686 5384: Ok sure .
My name is Mazviita Machingambi Thando . Iam the last born in a family of 3 .My parents are both teachers by profession  .Iam currently doing my Upper six at Thornhill High school .Iam studying Accounts , Economics and Mathematics and I wish to be an accountant one day . Iam quite a confident person and I have great passion with children .Iam currently the children ministries leader at my church . I also have done first aiding both at church and at school .
27/09/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's wonderful to hear that you are actively involved in your church and school community! As the children's ministries leader at your church and someone with first-aid experience, you have a valuable role in ensuring the well-being and spiritual growth of the young members of your congregation.
27/09/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yes iam very passionate about kids . I believe there are an important aspect of the community
27/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Mazviita! I am really happy to have you on board!
27/09/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
27/09/23, 9:04 am - +263 71 686 5384: Please enlighten me
27/09/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *NAME* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
27/09/23, 9:05 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
27/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 686 5384: Okkk thank you understood
27/09/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
27/09/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 686 5384: Yes I have read it
27/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 686 5384: Wow $800 he really worked hard
27/09/23, 9:18 am - +263 71 686 5384: Soo which means if hi scholarship was of 50% and he  was supposed to pay $3000 per year and he earned $800 this means that he will.only pay $2200
27/09/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, indeed!
27/09/23, 9:22 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 686 5384: I am pleased to  be interacting with  you all 😊🤝
27/09/23, 12:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Mazviita, I understand that you must be occupied with a lot of things, however it would be appreciated if you can be regular in during your session as only then we would be able to complete our fast track process. Right?
27/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok .Iam very sorry lessons had commenced during the time of our session . Iam very sorry
27/09/23, 1:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand. can we reconnect at 2:00PM?
27/09/23, 1:16 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes mam
27/09/23, 1:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! We will connect at 2:00PM
27/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok noted mam
27/09/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
27/09/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Afternoon  mam
27/09/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Yes iam ready
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
27/09/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/09/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok thank you
27/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Let me go through the newsletter
27/09/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Well l understood that there are 3 projects for EWYL and all these 3 will help in developing my skills especially being confident and interacting well with others. I also understood that l have to work very hard so that l attain  a number of scholarship credits
I have also noted that the use of social media and digital skills is an important aspect of today's world as well as the EWYL .
27/09/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things you are good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 71 686 5384: Ok mam will try by all means to follow these steps
27/09/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Friday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.

27/09/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before this, I want to know if you would be able to attend the session at this time?

30/10/23, 4:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Mazviita!

I apologize for being unable to connect since it was a weekend off for us. All these images are lovely!🌟
31/10/23, 7:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Mazviita and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
17/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Mazviita!
Hope you are doing well.

25/11/23, 6:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day, Mazviita!

I'm delighted to inform you that we have made another step towards our focus on employability and have effectively organized a *series of webinars* featuring a few  *amazing speakers from Africa*🤩 that our students in India have received the opportunity to attend. 

This effort ensures that our students are provided with abundant opportunities and exposure to enrich their learning experiences.🚀

Our recent webinars have covered *job-ready skills*, 21st-century skills- communication, networking, and more, and key focus topics like *plagiarism awareness and CV building.*
25/11/23, 6:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Guess what?🤔 Four of our Proud Edoofians recently landed paid internships only with their active participation and learning under the dedicated guidance of our *Career Development Officer, Mr. Anik.*💼

So, I wanted when would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
02/12/23, 8:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning @263716865384 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart.

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Mazviita!

I was hoping to connect with you at our scheduled time. May I ask if everything is alright? Are you facing any challenges?
