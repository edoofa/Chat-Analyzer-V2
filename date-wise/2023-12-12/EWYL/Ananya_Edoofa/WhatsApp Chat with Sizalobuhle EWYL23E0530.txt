I am Tenzin and you can address me as Ms. Tenzin. I am excited to embark on this mentorship journey with you, supporting you in achieving your goal and helping you unlock your full potential.
22/08/23, 8:50 am - +27 84 941 8738 joined using this group's invite link
23/08/23, 4:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: First thing first, *_Congratulations_* 
On being awarded the Edoofa scholarship, This is a fantastic opportunity to expand your horizons, gain new experiences and make memories that you will cherish for a lifetime.
You should feel proud of this achievement, as it is a testament to your hard work, dedication, and determination.
This scholarship is an opportunity for you to grow as an individual, learn about new cultures, ways of life, and achieve your dreams.
24/08/23, 8:33 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!
How are you today?

24/08/23, 12:59 pm - +91 78273 08969: Okay, I can understand.
24/08/23, 1:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: I am thrilled to be your mentor.  Before connecting with you today, I  reviewed your applications and gathered feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
24/08/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam that is absolutely amazing
24/08/23, 1:53 pm - +91 78273 08969: Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
24/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 562 0930: That will be okay Mam no problem with that so far
24/08/23, 2:51 pm - +91 78273 08969: It will be your responsibility to message me five minutes prior to the session to mark your attendance.
During these sessions, I will provide you with information on the EWYL program, our various projects that you can work on to earn credits, and also about our program structure.

This is known as our onboarding phase. Once the onboarding is complete, you will begin working on projects, and I will be there to guide you through any obstacles you may encounter.
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Well noted Ms Tenzin
24/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam ,l am pleasing to know the two key objectives
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +91 78273 08969: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.

The *second goal* is to help all our Edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam ,well noted
24/08/23, 3:09 pm - +91 78273 08969: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
24/08/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Thus amazing , l am happy for them and willing for the best with them as it is a blessing to me having a conversation with you all
24/08/23, 3:26 pm - +91 78273 08969: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/08/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 562 0930: That is wonderful to hear it sounds perfect
24/08/23, 3:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
24/08/23, 3:36 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam l would like to apologize on the weekends specifically Saturday l will be going to church starting from 10:00am up to 05:00pm
24/08/23, 3:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: You need not attend the session on the weekend.
24/08/23, 3:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/08/23, 3:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 562 0930: But l will tryto  manage to work with that in the evening after church
24/08/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Okay great Mam
24/08/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 562 0930: I completed reading the newsletter
24/08/23, 4:22 pm - +91 78273 08969: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
24/08/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 562 0930: The section where it is said the responsibility of shaping a better society rests not solely on the shoulders of established leaders and institutions,but also on the young and aspiring minds of today's students" whereby  us as students we have the potential to be the catalysts for positive change by making a tangible impact on the issues that matters most  and engaging dedication for it be the driving force in shaping a brighter future for all. Additionally ,the inspirational story  of one the Edoofians is so touching
25/08/23, 8:42 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

25/08/23, 8:48 am - +91 78273 08969: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

More so, you never achieve success unless you like what you are doing for example you don't have to be afraid to give best to what seemingly are small jobs because every time you conquer one it makes you stronger.

28/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Thank you mam

29/08/23, 9:49 am - +91 78273 08969: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 9:50 am - +263 77 562 0930: Yes Mam

29/08/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 562 0930: An audio compiled the whole progress of the 2nd project which is Community Building. As from the definition of Community Building (CB) that it refers to the process of establishing and strengthening the connection in relationship and shared identities among individuals within a particular group or community, so the main core of the project involves creation of a supportive and inclusive  wider means of individuals so that they can be able to work towards their common goals and which will promote social interactions and participations in shared sense of responsibility and ownership. By then students have to reach to  personal or extended networks that may boost their way of developing their networking and persuasion skills and learn how to leverage social media to offer African students an opportunity to join Edoofa's educational ecosystems that prepares them for the future.Also students are required interconnect with the African students who have recently graduated from their senior secondary school or whom are currently in a year of completion ,and then , by doing this it can help the organization grow as the students will be referred to the program. Just the way of following the given instructions will successfully complete the course of the project with a positive impact in the industry.

29/08/23, 12:46 pm - +91 78273 08969: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/08/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam
29/08/23, 12:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/08/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Am following
29/08/23, 12:55 pm - +91 78273 08969: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DDMMYYYY*
29/08/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Well 🙏
29/08/23, 12:58 pm - +91 78273 08969: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.

To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).

31/08/23, 2:06 pm - +91 78273 08969: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
05/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam l am 🙂
05/09/23, 2:16 pm - +91 78273 08969: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
05/09/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam
05/09/23, 2:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
05/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 562 0930: Well noted
05/09/23, 2:27 pm - +91 78273 08969: So, Sizalobuhle, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
05/09/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 562 0930: That is great mam and hope to admit accordingly
05/09/23, 2:33 pm - +91 78273 08969: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
05/09/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 562 0930: <Media omitted>

05/09/23, 3:15 pm - +91 78273 08969: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
Please note a few things:
FIRST- You will have your sessions on Monday and Thursday from 9:30am to 11:00 am.

05/09/23, 4:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: There won't be a session tomorrow as I'll be at the airport to receive the students. It's going to be a great experience. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

"Every morning brings new potential, but if you dwell on the misfortunes of the day before, you tend to overlook tremendous opportunities." – Harvey Mackay

I hope this message finds you well.
 It's time for our session; I'm looking forward to our productive time together. Let's make the most of it! 😊📚🧠
07/09/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 562 0930: Good morning mam thank you ,l am doing well hope for the same with you
07/09/23, 10:12 am - +91 78273 08969: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Tenzin, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
07/09/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 562 0930: Okay mam
07/09/23, 10:16 am - +91 78273 08969: Please let me know once you are done.
07/09/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 562 0930: Yes mam l am done
07/09/23, 10:24 am - +91 78273 08969: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
07/09/23, 10:28 am - +263 77 562 0930: That is well mam
07/09/23, 10:29 am - +91 78273 08969: To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that you will be having. I would like to brief you about the roles of your Counselor, your Admission Officer, and your EWYL Mentor. 
During your journey with Edoofa, you majorly go through 3 stages! Do you have any idea what might be the three stages?

Your *counselor* is your _first point of contact_. Your counselor has been guiding you during your _onboarding process_ where you learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, you are contacted by your _Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with your admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all your admissions-related queries like your _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._

Finally, you will be starting your _EWYL journey with your EWYL Mentor,_ where you get a chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help you fund your higher education. Your Mentor will be involved with you at every step and will be guiding your way throughout your journey. Your mentor will be your closest point of contact who will help you build your personality along with your skill set. All your queries related to your EWYL program will be addressed by your mentor.
Note: Your EWYL mentor will not be addressing your admission queries
I believe we are on the same page about the three points of contact and their roles. Feel free to reach out in case you have any queries.
07/09/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 562 0930: Ooh thus great thank you mam
07/09/23, 10:36 am - +91 78273 08969: hope you have received the Wednesday lesson, Please submit your understanding of the same in the EWYL line before your session. From now on we will have our session as per the schedule we discuss and on Wednesday you will receive your lesson and activity on Saturday. But any queries after your session time in EWYL should be addressed here in the EWYL group. And do not forget to perform the Proud Edoofian Ritual daily in your dedicated EWYL line.
Great day to you.
07/09/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 562 0930: Okay mam thank you
08/09/23, 8:38 am - +91 78273 08969: Good Morning!

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to personally share some important news about your mentorship.

Firstly, I want to express my gratitude for the journey we've shared together. Being your mentor has been a privilege, and I've enjoyed watching your remarkable growth. Your dedication to self-financing your education and developing 21st-century skills has been truly impressive.

Regrettably, due to my health, I can no longer continue as your mentor. This decision has been challenging, as I've always been passionate about guiding students like you toward a beautiful and successful educational journey.

The good news is that Ms. Ananya your new mentor will contact you on Tuesday. She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Ananya's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you!
