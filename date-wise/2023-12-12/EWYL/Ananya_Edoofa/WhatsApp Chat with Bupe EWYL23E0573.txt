24/08/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
24/08/23, 2:26 pm - +260 95 4583351: Sure, My name is Killian Koyi. I am Bupe's dad. Professionally, I work for a Mining firm as ERP support officer.

It is nice to connect with you.

24/08/23, 2:36 pm - +260 97 7880582: Thank you
24/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 9978102: Not really
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - +260 97 9978102: can you please explain
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Sure, so the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
24/08/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 9978102: thank you
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
24/08/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 2:57 pm - +260 97 9978102: I have read it
24/08/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 97 9978102: Alright. It was great getting to know you. Have a lovely day.
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 thank you for your time. Greatly appreciated 🙏

25/08/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 9978102: Yes
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
25/08/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/08/23, 2:43 pm - +260 97 9978102: I have read the newsletter
25/08/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: - So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/08/23, 2:49 pm - +260 97 9978102: I liked the 3 quotes and the hall of inspiration
25/08/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/08/23, 2:52 pm - +260 97 9978102: It really is
25/08/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
25/08/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
25/08/23, 2:55 pm - +260 97 9978102: Yes I am

28/08/23, 3:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. We shall now connect tomorrow to move forward with our journey!🛩️
28/08/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 9978102: Have a good day. Thank you for your time.
29/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

Are you ready for your session?✨
29/08/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 9978102: Yes I am
29/08/23, 2:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
29/08/23, 2:18 pm - +260 97 9978102: Ok
29/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 2:34 pm - +260 97 9978102: I am done with the document
29/08/23, 2:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
29/08/23, 2:45 pm - +260 97 9978102: I learnt that for the cooperate alliance project my aim is to understand the market i am going to work in in future and start preparing myself for it at an early stage.
Since the world has moved to the online set up due to the covid pandemic it's easier to contact companies.
To do my project effectively I should first contact the people close to me such as my neighbors and relatives, informing them about Edoofa and how it has helped me. Then I should create a LinkedIn account which will help me look for companies as well as their employees and decision makers and organize meetings with Edoofa.
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing.I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
29/08/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/08/23, 3:05 pm - +260 97 9978102: While I am searching for companies my task is to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and are willing to extend their help in the overall development of students.

In order for me to look for the right companies I keep into consideration the following things.
1. Nature of the company
 The company should either be student-centric, recreational or content-centric.

2.The scale of the company
The scale of the company I choose should not be either too big or too small.

3.The financial stability of the company.
The financial situation of the selected companies should be sound.

4. The background of the founder
The background of the selected founder should be strong in terms of experiences and qualifications.

Some platforms that I can use to search for these companies are LinkedIn, Crunchbase, Inc4media and Internshala.
29/08/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Bupe, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
29/08/23, 3:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tomorrow is the auspicious occasion of Raksha Bandhan, a significant religious festival in our culture. On this day, brothers and sisters come together to celebrate the special bond they share. Sisters tie a protective thread, known as a rakhi, around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing love, care, and the promise of protection. In return, brothers often give gifts and offer their support.⭐

Therefore, we won't be connecting tomorrow, we shall connect on Thursday now!

And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.
31/08/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 9978102: Yes

Facebook username: Bupe Koyi

31/08/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Bupe, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it !
31/08/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let us conclude our session here! See you next time.🛩️
31/08/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 9978102: Project 2 is the community building project in which I will have to approach my friends, brothers and sisters who have completed their education or have just written their exam and are willing to study abroad. I should tell them about my journey with Edoofa this far and tell the some of the career advice that my mentor and counselor have guided me with and I should also inform the about the EWYL program as well as expenses involved with the program.
I should identify individuals who are academically oriented and wish to study abroad seriously, these individuals should consult their parents and when they say yes to the application I can share these people with you.
And an offline application form will be sent as well as some posters that I can share with the individuals.
31/08/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 9978102: Alright.
01/09/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 9978102: Well noted
01/09/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
01/09/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.

28/10/23, 10:24 am - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 sorry for not getting back to you yesterday. My day was quite busy at work. However, let me share with you about the Kuomboka ceremony.
28/10/23, 10:30 am - +260 95 4583351: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Bupe!

Thank you for sharing that fascinating insight into the Kuomboka Ceremony in Zambia. It sounds like a truly unique and culturally significant event. I'm curious to know, what are some of the specific traditions or rituals associated with the Kuomboka Ceremony that make it stand out? And are there any special foods or customs that are part of this celebration?
31/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

31/10/23, 8:06 pm - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 Thank you for the update, this is exciting. Regarding the question you have asked I suppose Bupe is better placed to respond. She will be back home at the month end of November. I will ask her to respond accordingly. 🙏
31/10/23, 8:12 pm - +260 95 4583351: Though going by activities she has participated in previously, I think debate would be one such activity.
07/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Bupe and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 8:56 pm - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 thank you for sharing this wonderful news. We're well thanks and hoping for the best for Bupe during the exams. The factors that will help someone succeed in the EWYL program are:
Consistency
Being teachable
Following instructions and 
Being willing to learn new things
17/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Bupe!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

*When can we begin with our EWYL Sessions*, _please mention the date_.
17/11/23, 4:10 pm - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 Thank you for the lovely photos of Diwali. Regarding the EWYL sessions, Bupe returns on Tuesday 21/11/2023 and will reach out to you on her return but tentatively Friday 24/11/2023'
Thanks and best regards
24/11/23, 8:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Bupe!

I trust your exams went smoothly. Congratulations on completing this phase!
Now that the exams are over, it's time to resume our mentoring sessions. I would like to hear about your exam experiences and discuss your progress. Your dedication during exam preparations is commendable.
Let's get back on track with our sessions. The revised session timings are as follows:

-*Mondays to Friday*
-*1:30 PM to 2:30 PM*
-*on your EWYL Group*

Kindly make a note of the revised timings and be ready to join our session tomorrow. Your active participation is key to our collaborative success, and I am excited to continue our journey together.
02/12/23, 8:27 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning @260979978102 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
02/12/23, 8:37 am - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 good morning and thank you for getting in touch. Apologies I should have communicated to you that Bupe will no longer pursue her university education abroad. I did communicate to this information on the admissions group. Thank you for getting in touch.Best regards
02/12/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am sure that I will be able to help you with that. However, I need to understand what really happened. As your mentor, it is crucial for me to grasp the concerns and problems you have been facing while progressing with the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
02/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 95 4583351: My wife as a member of staff at a local University has a tuition waiver, so Bupe would pursue her university education at no cost. Thus we opted to go with this option.
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @260954583351 

I hope you are doing fine. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect earlier with you.
11/12/23, 10:37 pm - +260 95 4583351: @918800325457 I am well thanks. This is noted
