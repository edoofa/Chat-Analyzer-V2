03/10/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing! Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
03/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 610 4286: Yes I understand

03/10/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
03/10/23, 9:07 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
03/10/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 610 4286: Thank you for the addition
03/10/23, 9:08 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.

*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

03/10/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
03/10/23, 9:19 am - +263 71 610 4286: This is interesting, I'm following
03/10/23, 9:19 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
03/10/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

03/10/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
03/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 610 4286: The whole newsletter is interesting indeed but i liked the most the *3 Quotes For You*

09/10/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 610 4286: Yes that's true but, their scale is too small

Not just this, on Google, you can simply type, ‘Small scale Educational companies in African countries
After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.
09/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 610 4286: I have Linkedin and Facebook accounts, are they enough

09/10/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 610 4286: In the community building students have to identify friends, relatives, class mates who completed their high school and tell them about the EDOOFA program, EWYL, expenses. Identity people who are highly academical oriented and keen to pursue their education abroad.

I have to reach out to local schools in my region, speak with the principals and Headmasters and tell them about the EDOOFA program. I have to make a list of local High schools in my region, starting with my own school to connect with the Headmaster. Firstly I have to tell them why I joined the EDOOFA program and share program details with them. After that I would like to set up an online meeting of them with the EDOOFA. Lastly I have to share the contact details to my EWYL Mentor.
11/10/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?

Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:
Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
11/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 610 4286: 1. Tongwe High School, not connected with EDOOFA.                              2. I tell them that I have joined EDOOFA and also why I joined the program and share the program details with them. After that I ask them if they are free to connect with the EDOOFA, through online meeting.                                3. Matebeleland South Province
11/10/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Sydwell. You know your school is not connected with us. You have an excellent opportunity to connect with your own school and start earning credits.
11/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 610 4286: But I will confirm again, because lastly when I checked it was not connected.
11/10/23, 10:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. Now, Sydwell we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
11/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 610 4286: Is there a deadline on sending the information(company, students forms and school information) to you?
11/10/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: No, there is no deadline Sydwell.
11/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 610 4286: Thank I will be working on this project tirelessly
11/10/23, 10:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing. So Sydwell , since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully

11/10/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 610 4286: I want to ask something not regarding the EWYL program, can I go on?

11/10/23, 10:43 am - +263 71 610 4286: I want to know that when I'm I supposed to receive the offer letter from the universities?
11/10/23, 10:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Sydwell, I understand that you are quite excited to receive an offer letter; however, I would suggest that you consult this with the admissions team as they are the best people to guide you through.
11/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 610 4286: Thank you for the information
11/10/23, 1:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday  - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 1:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/10/23, 1:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

29/10/23, 3:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Sydwell!

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you!
30/10/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You have to follow your EWYL Ritual of saying Proud Edoofian, however, you do not have to attach " I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is"

04/12/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Sydwell!

I hope you are doing well. I've noticed that you consistently join the session late without my reminder. Your sessions are scheduled, and I've been waiting for you on your EWYL Line. Being punctual demonstrates dedication and sincerity not only to the program but in all aspects of life.

I want to emphasize the importance of punctuality. Is it acceptable if I don't conduct the session if you are not here on time?
