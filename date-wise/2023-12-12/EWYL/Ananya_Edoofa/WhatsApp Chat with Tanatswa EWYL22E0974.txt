You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Yes mam
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilitie
16/08/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I am ready for

Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I will improve and continue doing so, I hope I won't let you down mam
16/08/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 085 5400: I will mam,
16/08/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 4:30 pm - +263 78 085 5400: Sure mam
16/08/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 4:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!

20/10/23, 1:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good job, Tanatswa! However to add subtitles to a video, you can follow these general steps:

1. **Transcribe Your Video:** First, you'll need to have a transcript of the spoken content in your video. This can be done by typing out what is said in the video as accurately as possible.

2. **Choose a Subtitling Software:** There are various software tools available for adding subtitles to videos. Some popular options include Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, Aegisub, or online tools like Kapwing and Subtitle Edit.

3. **Import Your Video:** Open your chosen software and import your video file.

4. **Create Subtitle Tracks:** Most software allows you to add subtitle tracks or layers. Create a new subtitle track for your video.

5. **Add Subtitles:** Start entering the text from your transcript into the subtitle track. Make sure to specify the timing (start and end times) for each subtitle or caption. This is crucial to sync the text with the video content.

6. **Format and Style:** You can typically customize the font, size, color, and position of the subtitles. Ensure that the subtitles are easily readable and complement the video.

7. **Review and Adjust:** After adding subtitles, review your video to ensure they're properly synchronized. Make any necessary adjustments to the timing and formatting.

8. **Export the Video:** Once you're satisfied with the subtitles, export the video with the subtitles embedded.

The process may vary slightly depending on the software you use, but these are the fundamental steps for adding subtitles to a video. Be sure to check the specific instructions of the software you're using for more detailed guidance.

Well, I understand that it has been a while since we last connected for your Wednesday lesson and Saturday Activity. I realize that all of you had just arrived and were busy settling down, managing your timetables, attending the EWYL sessions, and handling administrative tasks such as processing FRRO and fee-related matters, in addition to your regular classes.

However, starting from now, we will resume our Wednesday Wisdom and weekend activities!
08/11/23, 4:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is your wednesday lesson!

Today's lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 1:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *2.  As you move forward, you will read the 'International Student Admission Eligibility Check' and some sample questions for verification.*

You know, there have been many instances when you share information about the Edoofa scholarship program; however, students tend to skip it. Later, when counselors inquire, they claim they don't know anything about it. This can lead to a waste of time and a decrease in the quality of your application forms.

Therefore, to avoid this, you have the authority to double-check the information you've shared with the students and ensure they have a clear understanding of it. This will help you guarantee that you have effectively communicated your information. For this, we have another step "International Student Admission Eligibility Check"

Now, as an Edoofa Certified Student Leader, your responsibility is to share these questions with the student, evaluate their answers, and check the student's eligibility.
If you notice any discrepancies, you should guide them to make the necessary corrections before sharing the form with me.

25/11/23, 5:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Saturday activity*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

*Deadline: Monday, 25th November 2023*
27/11/23, 5:52 pm - +91 90536 25894: Hello
27/11/23, 5:52 pm - +91 90536 25894: Mam
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - +91 90536 25894: Mam can I have a report regarding my grant
27/11/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 390 4171: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 6:06 pm - +91 90536 25894: The Spirit of Competition is a value that holds great importance in both personal and academic growth. To me, it signifies the drive to excel, the desire to push oneself beyond limits, and the determination to achieve success. This value has greatly influenced my approach to challenges and goals, as it has instilled in me a strong work ethic, resilience, and the ability to thrive under pressure. 

One real-life example where my Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success was during a national debate competition. As a member of my school's debate team, I was faced with tough opponents and challenging topics. However, my competitive spirit motivated me to put in extra hours of research and preparation, allowing me to deliver compelling arguments and counterpoints. In the end, my team emerged victorious, and I was awarded the Best Speaker title. This experience not only boosted my confidence but also taught me the importance of dedication, teamwork, and the relentless pursuit of excellence. 

In conclusion, the Spirit of Competition has not only shaped my personal and academic development but has also provided me with valuable life lessons. It has taught me the significance of hard work, perseverance, and the ability to rise above adversity. Through my real-life example in the debate competition, I have witnessed firsthand the positive impact of embracing this value. I believe that reflecting on and embracing the Spirit of Competition is essential for both individual and collective growth.
28/11/23, 8:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, Tanatswa! 🌟🏆Keep harnessing that competitive spirit—it's a powerful force for achieving goals and overcoming challenges. Your efforts and achievements are truly commendable!
28/11/23, 8:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Do you remember the Grant Challenge you participated in? Well, of course, you do, and the time has arrived when we will understand the outcome of the competition you were in!

Your performance has been critically observed, which will determine your eligibility for the grant. I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. Therefore, I have scheduled a discussion with you today.

*Time: 6:00 PM*
28/11/23, 8:11 am - +91 90536 25894: Okay mam will be waiting for you
28/11/23, 2:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Are you ready for the discussion, Tanatswa?
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 90536 25894: Yes
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tanatswa, why are you late?
28/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 90536 25894: Hello mam sorry for late response  I was recharging my phone
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually. 
Do you remember this?
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - +91 90536 25894: Yes mam I do remember
28/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great,  on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +91 90536 25894: Yes mam mostly about attendance
28/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 90536 25894: Thank you mam

28/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 90536 25894: Yes mam so how did I do
28/11/23, 3:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, since you came in early October, we are giving you another chance. Therefore, you have a golden opportunity to start looking at your sessions and webinar numbers from now on. We will take some time to evaluate your performance and engagement. Is that alright?
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - +91 90536 25894: I don't understand mam?
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/11/23, 3:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.

28/11/23, 3:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.

After scheduling multiple sessions with you for your $300 training, you could not attend those sessions. Being your mentor, I was concerned about you getting a certificate for student leadership. I even shared the pointers with you without you asking for them. Even after that, you could not share a 4-5 step summary with me?

It breaks my heart to see that even after so many efforts, you never reciprocate, even if these things are for your own benefit. After giving you a lot of days and considering everything, today I will be finalizing the list for Certified Student Leaders at 8:00 PM. If you can, submit your understanding before that.

03/12/23, 4:21 pm - +91 90536 25894: Title: Analysis of Input and Output in Scholarship Enrollment Project

Introduction:
The scholarship enrollment project aimed to identify and enroll potential students into a scholarship program. This essay provides a small analysis of the input and output of the project, highlighting the challenges faced, lessons learned, and the overall impact of the efforts. Furthermore, it explores potential improvements for future projects, setting goals for personal and academic development.

Input Analysis:
The input for the scholarship enrollment project consisted of identifying potential students who met the eligibility criteria. This involved conducting extensive research, reaching out to educational institutions, and utilizing various platforms to spread awareness about the scholarship program. The input also included designing and implementing an application process to evaluate the candidates' qualifications.

Challenges Faced:
1. Limited pool of potential students: One of the major challenges encountered was the limited number of eligible students who met the scholarship criteria. This restricted the overall impact of the project, as only six potential students were identified.

2. Lack of awareness: Despite efforts to spread awareness about the scholarship program, there was a lack of visibility among the target audience. This hindered the enrollment process and limited the number of applications received.

3. Evaluation process: Developing an effective evaluation process to assess the candidates' qualifications proved to be challenging. Ensuring fairness and transparency while considering various factors such as academic performance, extracurricular activities, and financial need required careful consideration.

Lessons Learned:
1. Importance of early planning: The project highlighted the significance of early planning and setting realistic goals. Starting the enrollment process well in advance would have allowed for a wider reach and increased the chances of identifying more potential students.

2. Effective communication strategies: The project emphasized the need for diverse and effective communication strategies to reach the target audience. Utilizing social media platforms, collaborating with educational institutions, and engaging with community organizations could have improved awareness and enrollment.

3. Streamlining the evaluation process: The project shed light on the importance of streamlining the evaluation process. Developing clear criteria and guidelines for assessing candidates' qualifications would have facilitated a more efficient and fair selection process.

Overall Impact:
Despite the challenges faced, the scholarship enrollment project had a positive impact on the lives of the six potential students who were identified. By providing financial support and opportunities for higher education, the project aimed to empower these students and contribute to their personal and academic growth. The impact of the project extended beyond the immediate beneficiaries, as it also raised awareness about the importance of scholarships and education within the community.

Improvement Goals:
1. Enhanced outreach strategies: In future projects, it is crucial to develop more comprehensive and targeted outreach strategies. Collaborating with local organizations, leveraging social media influencers, and conducting awareness campaigns in schools and colleges can help reach a wider audience.

2. Strengthening partnerships: Building strong partnerships with educational institutions, community organizations, and local businesses can enhance the visibility and credibility of the scholarship program.

3. Continuous evaluation and improvement: Regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the enrollment process and making necessary improvements is essential.

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to familiarize us with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing data. Our initial task involves a straightforward yet beneficial exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

*Activity Instructions:*

⭕Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or mobile device. If it's not installed, use any available spreadsheet software.

⭕Set Up Columns: Create three columns with the headers "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."

⭕Record Your Activities: Think about your activities from the past week, like studying, exercising, or socializing. List each activity separately in the "Activity" column.

⭕Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, note the corresponding day for each activity.

⭕Log Time: Record the time spent on each activity (in minutes) in the "Time Spent" column.

⭕Calculate Average Time: Use Excel functions to determine the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.

⭕Reflect: Dedicate space to jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.

⭕Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx"). 

Follow the provided instructions to submit the completed spreadsheet.
Remember, this activity introduces Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. If you encounter any challenges, feel free to reach out. Let's dive into today's exploration of Excel and make the most of it!
