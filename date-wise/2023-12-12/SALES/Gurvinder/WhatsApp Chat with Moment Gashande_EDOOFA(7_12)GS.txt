09/12/23, 11:41 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Munashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Munashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
09/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 71 934 2398: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 934 2398: It is a scholarship program initiated by Anhad Edutrain solutions Pvt Ltd,lndia.she did not tell me more about herself
09/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 934 2398: Edoffa is also working closely in collaboration with Zimbabwean ambassador to India Dr.GM Chipare
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you more about the program.
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
09/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 934 2398: Yeah thats what lm looking for
09/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Moment, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
09/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
09/12/23, 12:35 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
09/12/23, 12:44 pm - +263 71 934 2398: It will be difficult to include my parents in the counceling because they are not found on WhatsApp
09/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 934 2398: Hello
11/12/23, 9:00 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone.
11/12/23, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: I understand that, but please I hope you will discuss the session with your parents afterwards.
11/12/23, 7:58 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response in the counseling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counseling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9 am CAT*. 

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.
