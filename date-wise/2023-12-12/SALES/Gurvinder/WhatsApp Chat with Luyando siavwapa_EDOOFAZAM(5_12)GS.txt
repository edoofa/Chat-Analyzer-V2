*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same! <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 7:32 am - +260 767690386: Hey am Luyando siavwapa
05/12/23, 7:43 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Luyando,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/12/23, 7:44 am - +260 767690386: Thank you sir
05/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/12/23, 8:06 am - +260 767690386: These are  Indian scholarships that are given to Zambian students who just completed their grade 12 so that they can further their studies in india
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: That is correct, but let me also brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 8:43 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:44 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 9:43 am - +260 767690386: Yes sir I really want to do that
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Luyando, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 767690386: Yes I do have
05/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now Luyando, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/12/23, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +260 767690386: This message was deleted
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - +260 767690386: Yes sir am very willing to work very hard and get to the goals I set for myself
11/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +260 767690386: Studying abroad offers a unique set of advantages that align with my educational and career goals. Firstly, international universities often provide cutting-edge research facilities and a diverse academic environment, fostering a global perspective. Exposure to different teaching methodologies and interactions with a culturally diverse student body can enrich my learning experience.

Furthermore, studying abroad opens doors to a broader network of professionals and researchers, enabling me to establish valuable connections in the international scientific community. This networking potential is crucial for staying abreast of the latest developments in biochemistry and gaining insights into global research trends.

Additionally, some countries are renowned for their specialized programs and expertise in certain branches of biochemistry. By studying in such a location, I can benefit from curriculum depth and faculty specialization that might not be as readily available in my home country.

Ultimately, the decision to study abroad is driven by a desire to access world-class education, engage in diverse scientific environments, and build a global network that will enhance my career prospects and contribute to my long-term professional success.
11/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/12/23, 3:03 pm - +260 767690386: if granted the opportunity to pursue higher education abroad through this scholarship, my intent is to leverage the knowledge and experiences gained to contribute significantly to the development of the education system in my country. Upon my return, I plan to engage in initiatives aimed at bridging the gap between international standards and local educational practices.

I aspire to introduce innovative teaching methodologies and modern curriculum designs that align with global advancements in biochemistry. Collaborating with educational institutions, I intend to establish mentorship programs, emphasizing practical applications of theoretical concepts to better prepare students for real-world challenges.

Furthermore, I aim to contribute to research collaborations between international and local institutions, facilitating knowledge exchange and fostering a culture of continuous learning. By integrating global best practices, I hope to elevate the quality of education in biochemistry, ultimately nurturing a generation of skilled professionals capable of contributing meaningfully to scientific progress within our country.

In essence, my goal is not only to absorb the best practices abroad but to bring them back home, ensuring that the educational landscape in my country evolves to meet international standards and prepares students for success on a global scale.
11/12/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Luyando, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - +260 767690386: Yes I agree
11/12/23, 3:19 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 767690386: Yes
11/12/23, 3:26 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
