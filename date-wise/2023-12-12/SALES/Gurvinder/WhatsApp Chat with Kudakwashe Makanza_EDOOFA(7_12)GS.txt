08/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 697 5377: thank you Sir
08/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Kudakwashe, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Fungai, is that correct?
08/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 697 5377: No l got to know about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe or James .
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Simbarashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Simbarashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
08/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 697 5377: So Edoofa is a revolutionionary intiative that aims to provide education opportunities to underprivileged and deserving students across the glode .  
Some of the benefits of Edoofa are that it offers internships and industry oriented training through live projects
* Students have a lifelong alumni membership and opportunities for employment and outplace.
 *Edoofa has EWYL  which helps students to get internship opportunities from influential organisations, they also gain experience and Skill building.
Simbarashe's journey with Edoofa have been nothing but great . Edoofa helped him since day 1 and upto now . They have been taking care of him even in  hard times .
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Great answer, Kudakwashe.
08/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
08/12/23, 1:00 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes it is
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Kudakwashe, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
08/12/23, 1:25 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
08/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l think l have what it takes.
08/12/23, 1:57 pm - Gurvinder: Now Kudakwashe, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 236 8597: Hello
09/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Hello, Mrs.Nyachowe, how are you?
09/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 697 5377: Ready to continue
09/12/23, 11:23 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Sc. Agriculture*
09/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 236 8597: Ooh ok
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 697 5377: Noted  . That would be great
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
09/12/23, 11:51 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
09/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 697 5377: Very confident about achieving it  Sir.
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the program?
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes Sir
09/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Go ahead Sir...
09/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Kudakwashe, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted ✅.
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/12/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
09/12/23, 12:31 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

09/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Thank you Mr Gurvinder for your time . I will definitely go through the links .
11/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 697 5377: Good morning, Everyone!.
11/12/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 236 8597: Morning everyone
11/12/23, 9:26 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?* <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l think this will benefit me
11/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Kudakwashe, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 697 5377: Earn while You Earn help s a student as they get internship opportunities from influential organizations
*It helps a student to self finance their education  .
* Provides Practical experience
*Students get a chance to lead a student group or mentor young students.
*Helps a student to build Skills as Webinars help them break into a great carrer.
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 78 697 5377: That's exactly what I was looking for regarding my international education.
11/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Alright Kudakwashe, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 697 5377: Yes they will be supporting me for my higher education.
11/12/23, 12:15 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes we did .
11/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yes we are in  team
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Nyachowe, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 697 5377: The student will end up spending $ 2 250
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l am.
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yaa that's a lot of money.....
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Nyachowe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted.
11/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 697 5377: I  think so.
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Kudakwashe basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Noted✅.
11/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: @263786975377 Are we still connected?
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 697 5377: No am not
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes we are Mr Gurvinder
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 236 8597: Yes now we are connected....eish the network sometimes is down.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: Alright @263786975377 , so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 697 5377: Yes l do understood  the process
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 3:11 pm - +263 78 697 5377: So how do we start the Phase 2.
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
