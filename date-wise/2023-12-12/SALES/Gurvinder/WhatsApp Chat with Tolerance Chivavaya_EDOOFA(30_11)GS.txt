04/12/23, 10:02 am - +263 77 635 7862: Ok I learnt Edoofa it's a program that offers scholarships to study abroad in countries like lndia and Canada
04/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 635 7862: Makanaka told  me that this Edoofa program will guide me on choosing the program I want to study
04/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 635 7862: I also learn that this program offers scholarships to students who want study abroad
04/12/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: You are almost correct,Mrs.Mwamwifu.
04/12/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
04/12/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
04/12/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
04/12/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
04/12/23, 10:10 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
04/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 635 7862: It's true
04/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 635 7862: I think  I love this program of Earn while you Learn but can you tell me more about it and how it goes , and the kind of projects that is done
04/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Yes, I will explain everything, but first, let us be patient and continue with the counselling session.
04/12/23, 10:35 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs.Mwamwifu, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship
04/12/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
04/12/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

04/12/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.
04/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 635 7862: Ok. Please give me some time to read and understand how it goes
04/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
04/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Please reply through text.
04/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
04/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK thank you sir this is Tolerance speaking wasn't available because my had a breakup but from now on I'm available...

05/12/23, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tolerance, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
05/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 291 9625: I'm more than willing sir.. I am up for the challenge
05/12/23, 10:11 am - Gurvinder: That is great
05/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/12/23, 10:37 am - +263 78 291 9625: OK thank you.. I would love to study there because Zimbabwe is economy is unstable.. Many graduates are not going to work because  high rate of unemployment here. Also fees rates are high and there is limitation of programs due to high population of students who want learn so at the end of the they will end up taking only those with high grades thus limit us to do what we want in life
05/12/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
05/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 291 9625: I'm planning to change our country into a better society by dealing with crimes  in society helping our government to reduce the rate of crimes, mould young minds about importance of law and teaching them the importance of your program and also on how it will benefit us as the country
05/12/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tolerance, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
05/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 291 9625: I truly agree sir
05/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
05/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah I want to know why
05/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
05/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

05/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 291 9625: I think that is why u have chosen it
05/12/23, 1:29 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tolerance, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
05/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
05/12/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK thank you sir I got busy in the afternoon but tomorrow will talk
06/12/23, 7:50 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 291 9625: Morning how are you doing today
06/12/23, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: I am fine, how are you?
06/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 291 9625: I'm well sir
06/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 78 291 9625: Do not have any questions I am looking forward to hear from you
06/12/23, 9:52 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 291 9625: No none of us sir
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 9:55 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 78 291 9625: May I ask...., Are these cost paid by us??
06/12/23, 10:22 am - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
06/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 291 9625: OK sir so you are saying the remaining amount subtracting from 6000 to 8000 range will be payed by you
06/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Tolerance, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 291 9625: Ooh wow that's very interesting and I would like to know how this program  of earn while you learn goes n how am I going to benefit from it in order to reduce the costs
06/12/23, 10:34 am - Gurvinder: Tolerance, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 291 9625: OK I understand sir
06/12/23, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
06/12/23, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
06/12/23, 10:40 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

06/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
06/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 291 9625: I think it will benefit me but I want  to ask something
06/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 291 9625: Do you allow voice notes
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: Unfortunately, as this is a formal conversation, I cannot allow voice notes.
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tolerance, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
06/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 291 9625: OK sir
06/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 291 9625: Wow at least it's better
06/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
06/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Exactly sir this what I'm looking for
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Tolerance, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah I understand now
06/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tolerance, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
06/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah of course
06/12/23, 12:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yes sorry sir my network is tripping
06/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah I did  I tell them abt everything n how I am going to pay they say they are willing and they even say they liked the program of Earn while you learn
06/12/23, 7:13 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
06/12/23, 7:41 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK we continue tommor
06/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 635 7862: Good night
07/12/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 291 9625: Good morning
07/12/23, 9:27 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
07/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 291 9625: Sure
07/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
07/12/23, 9:41 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah sure sir I'm here
07/12/23, 10:31 am - Gurvinder: Tolerance as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 291 9625: About  $15 000 - $22 500
07/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tolerance, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK sir
07/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah but I want to understand something here.... You mean to say  I will not have to pay for every application to any university right......??
07/12/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, by enrolling in the Edoofa Program, you do not have to pay separately for applying multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations.
07/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK so that means I will pay once
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct, you only have to pay once for enrolling in the program.
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/12/23, 2:01 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are requested to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: However Tolerance, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 2:21 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yes
07/12/23, 2:48 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I continue?
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Ok
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK cool
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 291 9625: No sir
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 3:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tolerance, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.
07/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in your country itself.
07/12/23, 3:02 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yeah so the program E WYL starts after I pay my admission fee
07/12/23, 3:22 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL program starts after you get enrolled in the Edoofa program.
07/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 291 9625: OK sir so how do I get enrolled
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
07/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 291 9625: Yes still reading
07/12/23, 4:02 pm - Gurvinder: Please inform me once read.
07/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Have you read?
07/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 291 9625: So u are saying the registration fee will be payed together with the school fees
07/12/23, 4:20 pm - Gurvinder: The admission registration fees are a part of the University fees only and that is taken in installments.
07/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 291 9625: This is registration fee that u are mentioning here.. that is to be removed from my first year fee
07/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 291 9625: That means I have to pay my fees + other part of registration fee
07/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is correct.
07/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: You pay your fees in installments
07/12/23, 4:24 pm - Gurvinder: And the registration fees is subtracted from your fees.
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 291 9625: So you mean to say the $3000 that I'm supposed to pay for fees minus about $200 then the $100  left will pay it in January 2025...is that so....??
07/12/23, 4:35 pm - Gurvinder: Tolerance, once you are enrolled in the Edoofa program, the admission team starts with your admission process, when a University sends you an acceptance letter then some part of the University fee, you have to pay as a registration fee to secure your Scholarship seat, then only the remaining part of the University fee you have to pay that too in installments.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.
