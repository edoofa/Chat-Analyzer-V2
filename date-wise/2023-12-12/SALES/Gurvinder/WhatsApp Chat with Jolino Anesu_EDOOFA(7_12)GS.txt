You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
08/12/23, 7:49 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
09/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 1:21 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 8:05 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Jolino, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
