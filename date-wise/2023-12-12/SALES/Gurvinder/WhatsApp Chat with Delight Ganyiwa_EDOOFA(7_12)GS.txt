07/12/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mrs.Patricia Chirongera, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Jesca, is that correct?
07/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Correct
07/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Jesca, also do tell me whether you learnt about Jesca’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 395 8654: I have learnt that Edoofa program is a Scholarship that aims to empower students from developing countries by providing them with access to quality education.  After I have interacted with Jesca who is a beneficiary of the Edoofa program I have learnt that it helps her with comprehensive support system which provides financial assistance, mentorship, career guidance and personal development support.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct, I see you are well informed.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: But let me aslo brief you about the program.
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 1:40 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
07/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Thank you so much for the briefing am greatful
07/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 395 8654: I as a parent it will be my pleasure if my child benefit from this program.
07/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Am sorry my child is in class doing his lessons until 1430hrs he will be available my apology
07/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you for adding me in this group am Delight Ganyiwa. Am the one who is seeking for the enrollment of the Edoofa program. Its my pleasure to meet you here Mr Gurvinder, Mr Shubham and Mr Jyotishman.
07/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: Pleasure to meet you too, Delight.
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Delight, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I think i have what it takes.
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 880 5139: I'm sorry I was in a lesson when you created the group
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - Gurvinder: Now Delight, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

I love knowing that I can use my skills and knowledge to improve the health and well-being of others. It's very rewarding to see the impact I can have on someone's life, and it's what drives me to become a doctor and apart from that i want a well paying job so that i can be financially stable.

08/12/23, 9:49 am - Gurvinder: Delight, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
08/12/23, 9:50 am - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like:

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
08/12/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 880 5139: Ok
08/12/23, 10:25 am - Gurvinder: May I suggest that you consider *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*, Biotechnology is one of the most important fields in modern scientific research as the field deals with the application of biology and different techniques to modify products so that it can be used for human needs. The three-year undergraduate course equips the aspirants with skills to alter the DNA of various living organisms.
08/12/23, 10:35 am - +263 78 880 5139: I was thinking of Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy.
08/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: Noted, that too is an excellent course?
08/12/23, 10:52 am - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you about it?
08/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 880 5139: Yes please
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Gurvinder: The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
08/12/23, 11:12 am - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you this is also a good course
08/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 395 8654: Well explained he like it
08/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 880 5139: My name is Delight Ganyiwa from Zimbabwe. In 5 years after completion of the course i would see myself as a physiotherapist who is highly skilled and able to help people make a difference in their lives.After 5 years i would have gained experience in many different areas concerning physiotherapy and therefore i would be able to provide good care to patients.I would be able to help people recover from injuries and improve their health. The Edoofa's program will help me gain the skills and knowledge i require to reach my goal of becoming a successful physiotherapist. Through Edoofa's program i would have an opportunity to have the training i need which would allow me to provide better care to my patience.After completing the course i would like to build my own private facility that deals with the physical wellness of people.And take care of my siblings too.
08/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Delight, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
08/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I am
08/12/23, 2:13 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 880 5139: There are low chances of getting a job here in Zimbabwe after graduating and India is a more advanced country in education than my home country. There are also poor learning facilities and equipment in my country so that's why I want to study abroad. If i study abroad it improves my chances of getting a job in many countries.
08/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
08/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 78 880 5139: If im given this opportunity to pursue my higher education through this scholarship l would like to establish exchange programs with international universities so that student from my county can also benefit from opportunities like this one and i would like to share my experiences that i get with students from my country.
08/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Delight, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
08/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I agree
08/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
08/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Of course Yes, though I have some little insight on how  India is advanced in medical studies.
08/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
08/12/23, 3:14 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

08/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: So now Delight, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 880 5139: l don't have anything to ask yet but am greatful on how India is developing and issuing quality education programs to others.
08/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: So now Delight, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
08/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 880 5139: I dont have any questions for now but i am greatful on how India is developing and issuing quality educational programs to others.
08/12/23, 7:00 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Okay thank you
08/12/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 395 8654: Thank you
08/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 302 5297: Thank you so much
09/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 880 5139: Okay sir
09/12/23, 10:34 am - +263 78 395 8654: Afternoon we are fine. It's okay.
09/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 302 5297: Afternoon, we are doing well.
09/12/23, 11:19 am - Gurvinder: Let us continue the session now.
09/12/23, 11:19 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
09/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 880 5139: I am not familia with the cost of similar higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India and i dont know any family member who is.
09/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
09/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
09/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
09/12/23, 11:43 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you i understand.
09/12/23, 12:03 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Delight what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 302 5297: The cost will be within reach then
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Wonderful thank you
09/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
09/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - Gurvinder: Delight, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you for enlightening me.
09/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

09/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
09/12/23, 12:40 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 880 5139: I do appreciate that Edoofa is providing its students with valuable information and resources to help them succeed in their chosen fields. I think that this kind of support will benefit me and help me gain experience as well.
09/12/23, 1:19 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

11/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 7:52 am - +263 78 395 8654: Good morning we are fine . Thanks
11/12/23, 7:53 am - +263 77 302 5297: A very good morning to you all
11/12/23, 7:53 am - +263 78 880 5139: Good morning to you too
11/12/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Delight, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 880 5139: I understand thank you
11/12/23, 9:40 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you for informing me
11/12/23, 10:12 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 880 5139: I think it will help other students see the value in Edoofa's unique approach to education.
And I can definitely see how this makes Edoofa different from other education platforms.
11/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 78 880 5139: That is exactly what I'm looking for.
11/12/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Alright Delight, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 78 880 5139: Yes they will be supporting me.
11/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I did.
11/12/23, 10:53 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 880 5139: Yes i am
11/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Delight as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 11:01 am - +263 78 880 5139: If a student applies in 5 Universities the student will end up spending from $1500-$2250
11/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: Exactly Delight, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/12/23, 11:56 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Okay
11/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I do.
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: Delight, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Thank you i understand
11/12/23, 1:41 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes I am familiar with the cycle
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: Alright NAME, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes i did thank you
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 880 5139: No i dont have any questions yet.
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

11/12/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Sorry may i ask, I am currently in A level and i will be in form 6 in 2024 and i will write my A level exams in October/November 2024 and the A level results will be out in February 2025 so I wanted to be enrolled in 2025 if its possible.
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: Excuse me, let me explain for your intake of 2025 again.
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: As you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes we are.
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 880 5139: Yes thank you for the information.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 880 5139: No
11/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*
