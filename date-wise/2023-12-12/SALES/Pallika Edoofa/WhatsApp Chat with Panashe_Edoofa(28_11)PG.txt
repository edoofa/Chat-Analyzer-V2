07/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 592 3877: I understand that it is very important to understand the current scholarship scenario.
---Moreover it's the wishes to African students to be fully funded scholarship but continuously academic excellence is one of the most significant criteria for fully funded scholarship and a handful of exceptionally meritorious students meet that.
In addition there is sad part is a very small fraction of students that are able to get outstanding academic records have high GPA because there are very few genuine cheritable organization and as a higher education specialist who has helped tens of thousands of over the last years .a scholarship can only be earned on the basis of merit,talent and attitude.

**I understand that Edoofa are social for-profit organization which aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunity to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities

09/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 592 3877: Shortages of resources
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Panashe!
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 592 3877: No
09/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason?
09/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 592 3877: Because I don't have money to pay fees abroad
09/12/23, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, Have you compared the cost of education through our program with those in Zimbabwe?
09/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 592 3877: Not yet
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, according to you how much is the cost of education through our program?

On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity

11/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 592 3877: Me and my family they can not afford the expenses of comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India
11/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
11/12/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 592 3877: Yes
11/12/23, 7:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
11/12/23, 7:12 pm - +263 78 592 3877: I don't know
11/12/23, 7:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
11/12/23, 7:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

11/12/23, 7:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 592 3877: I'm not understanding the question ms
11/12/23, 7:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is not a question, Panashe
11/12/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 592 3877: Okay
11/12/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 592 3877: Explain to me
11/12/23, 7:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, The Earn While You Learn Program helps students afford higher education by allowing them to earn scholarship credits. Let's say the annual fee is $2200. If a student earns $100 in scholarship credits per month, they can accumulate $1200 in a year, reducing the cost to $1000. This covers tuition, food, and accommodation, making the monthly cost for the family around $90-$100. Importantly, there's no limit to how much a student can earn; it depends on their hard work and dedication to sponsor their education.
