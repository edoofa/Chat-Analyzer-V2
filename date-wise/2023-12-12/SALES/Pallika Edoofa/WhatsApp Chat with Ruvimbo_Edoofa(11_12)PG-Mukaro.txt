11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the results, Mrs. Churimbo, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Ruvimbo about achieving it
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As his evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 326 1101: No
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 326 1101: Yes
11/12/23, 5:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, I was awaiting for your response!
11/12/23, 6:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Churimbo, Based on my evaluation I would like to tell you that We do offer EEE(Electrical and Electronics Engineering) but it requires Chemistry at A level and as you do not have chemistry and as per your subject combination and grades Ruvimbo is eligible to have

 *Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering* 

Or

*Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering*


Do you want me to explain any of these courses in depth? <This message was edited>
