11/12/23, 5:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Rambo, I understand your interest in Aerospace Engineering. Given your subject combination and grades, I recommend pursuing a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering. This pathway can serve as a stepping stone toward your goal for several reasons:

Foundation in Engineering Principles: Mechanical engineering provides a strong foundation in fundamental engineering principles, which is crucial for any specialization, including Aerospace.

Overlap of Core Concepts: Many core concepts in Mechanical Engineering, such as fluid dynamics and materials science, overlap with Aerospace Engineering, making it a natural progression.

Versatility: A diploma in Mechanical Engineering offers versatility, allowing you to explore various engineering fields. This flexibility can be advantageous as you refine your focus toward Aerospace.

Practical Skills: Mechanical engineering programs often emphasize hands-on practical skills, which are highly applicable and valuable in the aerospace industry.

By starting with a Diploma in Mechanical Engineering, you can build a solid foundation of knowledge and skills, making the transition to Aerospace Engineering smoother and more effective in the long run.
