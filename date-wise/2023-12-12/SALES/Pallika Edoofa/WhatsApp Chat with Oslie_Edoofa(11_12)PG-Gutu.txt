11/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 453 2562: The course she wishes to undertake is medicine as a first preference phamacy second but if her passes do not qualify her in those two she would take any courses which are available in the medical industry which suits her A level passes
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Tsuro, I will be guiding you about the same further, Moving forward, I kindly request that you share Oslie's O level results with me, preferably in picture format for a more comprehensive overview.
11/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 453 2562: Will the students be staying on campus and how long are their semesters and do they come back home for semester breaks or they will be working and if they are working where will they be staying
11/12/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 453 2562: I have network issues I've sent the copy of results but it's not delivering may you be patient
11/12/23, 5:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Tsuro, There are two options for Accommodation from which you are free to choose. 

1) Campus Accommodation- Students live in hostels inside the University premises.You are free to choose the type of hostel rooms and the seaters. There are single seaters, two seaters and more. 

2) Outside Campus-Accommodation is arranged in apartments outside the University campus.It is close to Universities and cheaper than in campus

After the University Sessions you will be given these options and can choose from them
11/12/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, The semesters are of 5 months each with 2 months of summer vacation
11/12/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Students usually stay at their residence, do attachments, work on Earn While You Learn Program and ensures education isn't  hampered but they can definitely visit their families during vacation and spend time with them.

11/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 77 453 2562: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mrs. Tsuro.
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 6:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As Oslie's evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate her interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
11/12/23, 7:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 453 2562: No I haven't
11/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 453 2562: I would like to hear from you.the opportunities,and the disadvantages if there are any
