11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Nokutenda, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
11/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

11/12/23, 1:17 pm - +27 62 617 4643: No
11/12/23, 1:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:19 pm - +27 62 617 4643: I understand
11/12/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nokutenda, Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue

Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

11/12/23, 1:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!

Being an edoofian can enable me to achieve my career goals by providing all the necessary training and education
11/12/23, 1:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nokutenda, I appreciate and admire your insight.

However, as your concierge, I would like to inform you that the professional path you have selected will need a significant amount of hard work and attention.

So, are you prepared to put in *200%* effort and seize any possibilities that come your way in order to alter your career?
11/12/23, 1:32 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Yes , i am prepared
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.
11/12/23, 1:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nokutenda, Continuing the session, I hope that you are aware that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform
By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
11/12/23, 2:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Are we connected, Nokutenda?
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Yes
11/12/23, 2:13 pm - +27 62 617 4643: NO im not familiar
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Nokutenda!
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
11/12/23, 2:18 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Yes
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
11/12/23, 2:19 pm - +27 62 617 4643: No i don't
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
11/12/23, 2:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
11/12/23, 2:25 pm - +27 62 617 4643: I think it is very beneficial and that i will also benefit from the Earn While You Learn program
11/12/23, 2:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Okay
11/12/23, 2:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Nokutenda, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
11/12/23, 2:30 pm - +27 62 617 4643: I like the first point
11/12/23, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Expert Career Counseling*

11/12/23, 2:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
11/12/23, 2:32 pm - +27 62 617 4643: My parents
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
11/12/23, 2:33 pm - +27 62 617 4643: They have no problem with it
11/12/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Nokutenda, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
11/12/23, 2:37 pm - +27 62 617 4643: It is
11/12/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
11/12/23, 2:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Please explain
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure Nokutenda! <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Okay
11/12/23, 2:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 2:42 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Stage 4
11/12/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Nokutenda,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Yes please
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure!
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:48 pm - +27 62 617 4643: Okay
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
11/12/23, 2:50 pm - +27 62 617 4643: I am clear
