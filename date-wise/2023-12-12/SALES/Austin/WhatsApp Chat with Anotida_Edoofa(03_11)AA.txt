10/11/23, 6:54 pm - Arshita: Thank you for sharing
10/11/23, 6:54 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about achieving it.
10/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I will try my best ..thank you
10/11/23, 8:16 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

10/11/23, 8:51 pm - Arshita: Please be advised that due to the ongoing festive week, our next session is scheduled to resume at *9:30 am CAT on Tuesday(14/11/2023)*. If you encounter any scheduling challenges, please inform me of your availability, and we will make the necessary adjustments accordingly.

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

14/11/23, 3:23 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.

15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Arshita: BA in Film Production:
A Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Film Production is an undergraduate degree program that focuses on the various aspects of creating films, including pre-production, production, and post-production processes. This comprehensive program aims to equip students with the skills and knowledge necessary to work in the dynamic and creative field of filmmaking.

Throughout the program, students typically learn about screenwriting, directing, cinematography, editing, sound design, and production management. They gain hands-on experience through practical projects, where they work collaboratively to produce short films or documentaries, allowing them to develop their storytelling abilities and technical proficiency.

In addition to the technical aspects, students are exposed to film history, theory, and criticism. They study the evolution of cinema as an art form, exploring various genres, styles, and influential filmmakers from different periods. Understanding film theory enhances their analytical abilities and helps them approach their own creative work with a critical eye.

BA in Film Production programs often encourage students to specialize in a particular area of filmmaking, depending on their interests and career goals. Some may choose to focus on directing, while others may lean toward cinematography, screenwriting, or editing.

Graduates of a BA in Film Production program can pursue careers in the film industry as filmmakers, directors, producers, editors, cinematographers, screenwriters, or production managers. Some may also explore opportunities in television, advertising, or online content creation.

BA in Theatre:
A Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Theatre is an undergraduate degree program designed to provide students with a comprehensive education in various aspects of theatre arts. This program aims to cultivate creativity, critical thinking, and practical skills related to the performance and production of theatrical works.

The BA in Theatre curriculum typically covers a wide range of topics, including acting, directing, stage design, playwriting, theatre history, and dramatic literature. Students gain a deep understanding of the theatrical process from both artistic and technical perspectives.

The acting component of the program focuses on developing students' performance skills, including characterization, voice modulation, movement, and improvisation. Directing courses teach students how to conceptualize and guide theatrical productions, making artistic choices that bring a script to life on the stage.

Stage design and technical theatre courses introduce students to the fundamentals of set design, lighting, sound, and costume design, as well as stage management. This hands-on training ensures students are well-versed in the practical aspects of theatre production.

Throughout the program, students often participate in numerous stage productions, providing them with invaluable practical experience and the opportunity to apply what they have learned in a real-world setting.

Moreover, students may have the opportunity to explore theatre theory, delving into the historical and cultural significance of theatrical works and examining various theatrical movements and genres.

Upon completing a BA in Theatre, graduates can pursue diverse career paths in the performing arts industry. They may work as actors, directors, stage managers, set designers, lighting designers, costume designers, playwrights, theatre educators, or arts administrators. Additionally, some graduates may choose to further their studies and pursue advanced degrees in theatre or related fields.

15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Arshita: This message was deleted

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
15/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 572 1934: As of now I am not really aware of such
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But international education is bound to be expensive
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I think my parents can afford the cost of education
15/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But I would want to consult my parents first
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
15/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I do not
15/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But I would love to do that and help my parents with my tuition fee
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:25 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
15/11/23, 3:29 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I think the EWL program is really beneficial to students
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
15/11/23, 3:33 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 3:48 pm - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I understand
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
15/11/23, 3:58 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships.

07/12/23, 11:20 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
07/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 572 1934: When will we continue with the counseling sessions
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Arshita: Are you interested in the program and willing to continue?
07/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 572 1934: Yes i am willing to continue
07/12/23, 11:36 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
07/12/23, 11:36 am - Arshita: Are your parents in support of you?
07/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 572 1934: My father has finally agreed
07/12/23, 11:36 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!

07/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 572 1934: I think I did
07/12/23, 11:38 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
07/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 572 1934: My father will be there for me
07/12/23, 11:53 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 572 1934: My family has always been positive about studying abroad
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But sometimes they fear human trafficking
07/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But they support studying abroad if there is an occupation guarantee after graduating
07/12/23, 12:27 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
07/12/23, 12:27 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
07/12/23, 12:27 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
07/12/23, 12:27 pm - Arshita: Being your parents, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details
07/12/23, 12:28 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 572 1934: That's correct
07/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
07/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
07/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
07/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Yes ..I m listening
07/12/23, 12:37 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
07/12/23, 12:37 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
07/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Okay thank you
07/12/23, 12:40 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
07/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 572 1934: So I start the EWL program in Zimbabwe and continue in India
07/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: Once you get enrolled, you will be added to your admissions group and your EWYL mentor will be allotted and you can start your EWYL journey while you re still in Zimbabwe
07/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 572 1934: So what will we be doing exactly
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 572 1934: We've moved past stage one
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: You can go through it once again
07/12/23, 12:54 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
07/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Yes ...I would like to know about it
07/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 572 1934: But I didn't receive the acceptance letter
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: We have just discussed that!

07/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Okay ..I understand
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
07/12/23, 12:58 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
07/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I understand now

07/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 78 572 1934: So you can choose any university ..as long as it is in India ?
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - Arshita: Yes, you will be receiving offer letters from different universities. 

Our admissions team will guide you through the entire process.
07/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Ok thank you
07/12/23, 7:23 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*
Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you had a great session with Ms Arshita and learned about the program better. Now, I will be guiding you ahead to the Eligibility check stage after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
08/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 351 5134: I am ready
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Austin: It is good to connect with you today, Mr Kunge

I hope you are doing well
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Austin: I believe you have been following the sessions on the group regarding the program. What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me, please?
08/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 78 351 5134: I in first place l was not quite certain with the general welfare of my daughter abroad because some aspiring students have fallen victims of borgus organisations. I hope and trust that we have fallen in the hands of the genuine Edoofa that has previously assisted some of the students from Africa including Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 351 5134: What are the minimum qualifications required for one to study in India.
08/12/23, 3:38 pm - Austin: I am glad that you understand this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your child's career!
08/12/23, 3:39 pm - Austin: Being a parent, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of your child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, you will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

08/12/23, 3:43 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 3:45 pm - Austin: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about your child achieving it.
09/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 351 5134: Can you briefly elaborate on the term Earn While You Learn.
09/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 351 5134: Well explained, thank you
09/12/23, 11:47 am - Austin: Good Day to you all!
09/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Good day to you too sir
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Anotida!
09/12/23, 1:25 pm - Austin: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
09/12/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 572 1934: Is it possible if I may change from film production to studying law
09/12/23, 1:36 pm - Austin: May I know, why would you like to change the course to law?
09/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 572 1934: I kind of have 2 dreams ....so I did some self introspection and realized  law weighs higher than film production
09/12/23, 1:49 pm - Austin: This is well noted Anotida!
So may I know what fascinated you towards pursuing a course and career in law?
09/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 572 1934: The fact that I'll be the first advocate in the family ...and I'll mostly be  making a living out of a talent ......I feel I have what it takes to pull through

09/12/23, 2:36 pm - Austin: I do understand and appreciate your willingness!
09/12/23, 2:36 pm - Austin: Based on my evaluations, considering your subjects, interests and passion towards law you are eligible to pursue
