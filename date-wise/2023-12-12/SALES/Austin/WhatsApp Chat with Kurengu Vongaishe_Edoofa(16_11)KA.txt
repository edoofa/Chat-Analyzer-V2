22/11/23, 1:04 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
22/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 551 2729: Yes l do
22/11/23, 1:50 pm - Austin: Good to hear that!

*"Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going." - Sam Levenson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 585 5103: Yes 
Good morning
09/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
09/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
09/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 585 5103: To be clear so you mean,
Basic university expenses(library,wifi  laundry etc)
Food
Accommodation 

Are the expenses to be covered by the student's family
09/12/23, 11:04 am - Kunal: That is right, Mrs Timothia
The reduced cost of education($2000-$3000)per annum includes the remaining tuition fee, food, accommodation, and basic necessities such as Wifi, Laundry, Library fee,s etc.
09/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 585 5103: Ok yeah it is affordable
09/12/23, 11:10 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
09/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 77 585 5103: No
09/12/23, 11:11 am - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/12/23, 11:11 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
09/12/23, 11:11 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
09/12/23, 11:12 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
09/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 585 5103: Yeah it is beneficial in that student will be provided with scholarship credits according to performance 
And the program has a variety of projects.
Can a student.choose which project.they want to.take.part in
09/12/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable.
The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
09/12/23, 11:21 am - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
09/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 585 5103: Understandable
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
09/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 585 5103: *4
09/12/23, 11:50 am - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

09/12/23, 11:50 am - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping Kurengu with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
09/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 585 5103: Me
09/12/23, 11:52 am - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
09/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 585 5103: This is the first time so I  am anxious  about it  but since you mentioned that there would be a caretaker I am actually okay with that
09/12/23, 11:55 am - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make her career advance at even a greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
09/12/23, 11:55 am - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
09/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 585 5103: Yeah I  believe that is it and also information about the university
09/12/23, 12:34 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
09/12/23, 12:34 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/12/23, 12:34 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
09/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 585 5103: Yes please
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 585 5103: Ok proceed
09/12/23, 2:43 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 585 5103: The first stage only
09/12/23, 2:49 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 585 5103: Ok proceed
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
09/12/23, 3:00 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
09/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 585 5103: Yes I am
09/12/23, 5:57 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
09/12/23, 5:57 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
