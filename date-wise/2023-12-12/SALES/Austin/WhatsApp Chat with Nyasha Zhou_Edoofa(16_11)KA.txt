Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/11/23, 1:56 pm - Kunal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than *200 schools in Zimbabwe*. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with *St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others*. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few *St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.

17/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Yes how many points at A lvel in order  to qualify  for that?
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 254 7295: Yes
17/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
17/11/23, 2:13 pm - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
17/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 152 3463: yes i am

*I am Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor at Edoofa*

I will be guiding you further through the Edoofa Scholarship Program and aspects. Are you ready?
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 152 3463: Good Afternoon
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 152 3463: yes
20/11/23, 12:23 pm - Austin: Good to hear from you, Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well
20/11/23, 12:23 pm - Austin: PLease address the same and let us continue
20/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 152 3463: i think India's rich culture could help me grow as a person morally and also help kickstart this career as i would be around like minded people who have proven themselves to be  juggernauts in technology
20/11/23, 12:36 pm - Austin: Indeed Nyasha 
As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
20/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 152 3463: i'm not familiar with the figures but i know it's quite high
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - Austin: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 152 3463: amazing what you and your program are doing for students
20/11/23, 1:22 pm - Austin: Thank you for your good words, Nyasha!
Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
20/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 152 3463: yes i do
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Austin: Good to know,
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 152 3463: no
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable.It is through the *Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
20/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

20/11/23, 2:21 pm - Austin: *Webinars: -*

20/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 152 3463: i think it's a really great program and the experience can be a building block in one's career
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 2:41 pm - Austin: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
20/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 152 3463: so what happens when the money you're working has surpassed the scholarship credits
20/11/23, 3:04 pm - Austin: Do you mean if the money is more than the cost of education?
20/11/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 152 3463: yes
20/11/23, 4:25 pm - Austin: In that case, the additional earnings can be used for your personal needs, to buy gadgets etc
20/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 152 3463: understood
20/11/23, 4:38 pm - Austin: This message was deleted
20/11/23, 4:52 pm - Austin: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships.

08/12/23, 1:58 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Kunal: Are we connected?
08/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 221 3657: I will be responsible as the father
08/12/23, 2:40 pm - Kunal: That is completely understandable
So how do you feel about your child studying abroad?
08/12/23, 3:29 pm - Kunal: I am expecting a response from your end, please
08/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Am excited .He will get the nuch needed experience that is lacking local.I hope he will apply the knowledge  for the development of a better Zimbabwe
08/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make his career advance at even a greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job which would actually help in uplifting your family and provide a peaceful and hassle free life.
08/12/23, 4:49 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
08/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Additionally  to what you have said perhaps details of my employer and how i will manage to pay the balamce of fees.

Regards
08/12/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
08/12/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
08/12/23, 5:03 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 221 3657: The cost is good thanks to Edoofa program
08/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
08/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
08/12/23, 5:06 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/12/23, 5:21 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
08/12/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Yes lets proceed
08/12/23, 5:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 77 221 3657: I have gone through  the diagram and believe we have covered up to stage 4.
08/12/23, 6:06 pm - Kunal: That is right.We had very well covered till the Acceptance Letter and Enrollment formalities which is in stage 4.Even though we had mentioned stages 5 and 6 briefly we are left with some more information from the last two stages
So shall I explain it to you
08/12/23, 6:06 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Yes
08/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
08/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
08/12/23, 6:08 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
08/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 77 221 3657: Clear
08/12/23, 6:51 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
08/12/23, 6:51 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
09/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 152 3463: Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering 
India
$6000-8000
$200-$3000
$350 in 7 days
Basically a student is given work to complete and the money the student will be due to receive as payment will go down as scholarship credit so the fees to pay will be less
