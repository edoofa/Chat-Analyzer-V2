02/12/23, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 10:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that Ms. Loveness, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
02/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 263 4652: I hope so.
02/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 155 8395: Our family is from Masvingo Central District under Chief Murinye in Masvingo province. It is a family of six me being the second eldest daughter.

02/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 263 4652: Given the opportunity i think i can manage
02/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 155 8395: Not yet experienced it
02/12/23, 10:43 am - +263 78 155 8395: Am still waiting for my A' level results
02/12/23, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Ms. Loveness, However, I do understand the how difficult it is to manage Mangoma's higher education and other children's school expenses.
02/12/23, 11:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Considering your family conditions, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
02/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 263 4652: Some of these opportunities, I lack knowledge. I lack information. Given proper information of the  employment opportunities i can pursue them
02/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 263 4652: Where you said ''your employability'. Were you referring to me.
02/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 155 8395: My parent
02/12/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 155 8395: She is the one to support me
02/12/23, 11:33 am - +263 77 263 4652: Yes I would like to pursue it especially when I consider the level of employment in our country. The rate of unemployment is too high.
02/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 263 4652: I think I can manage to raise the required amount.
02/12/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: It was referred to Mangoma
02/12/23, 11:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!!
02/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 263 4652: Alrighty

02/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 155 8395: I would do try my best once l got an opportunity like this one
02/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 155 8395: Currently l have O'level results only  and am still waiting for my A'level results
02/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, are you having the term results of A level?
02/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes I do have
02/12/23, 12:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Please share that too
02/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Okay
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 77 263 4652: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Loveness.
02/12/23, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know why the grades are low?
02/12/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Yes the grades are low. Science teachers are very mobile in our home country and they take long time to replace. So she spent most of the time without a chemistru teacher.
02/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Magona, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/12/23, 12:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also,As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
02/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Sure I am confident
02/12/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I did a research in passive. I haven't applied yet
02/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I have hope and trust that l did well
02/12/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Thank you
02/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, I would like to know out of these in which course you are more inclined to medicine, computer science, mechatronics and robotics?
02/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 155 8395: First preference _ medicine
Second preference - robotics | mechatronics 
Third preference - civil engineering
02/12/23, 12:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, I would like to know that if you are interested in Medicine, so why haven't you opted Biology?
02/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I have passion in computers that's why l opted  physics rather than biology.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 263 4652: She did not do well O level biology because she lacked online lessons during vivid.
02/12/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 263 4652: But she wanted Medicine
02/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 263 4652: So because of that reason, she could not do A level biology
02/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Covid
02/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 263 4652: Thank you for such detailed information
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Okay thank you
02/12/23, 1:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: No problem, Ms. Lovenes. Considering her subjects and interests, as her counselor, I recommend guiding her toward engineering courses, given her eligibility. Considering her interest in computers, I would suggest a B.Tech in Computer Science (CSE). Alternatively, she could explore Civil Engineering. Would you like a more detailed explanation of these options?
02/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes
02/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Which course you would like me to explain?
02/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 155 8395: B tech Computer science

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
04/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes l am aware and I once shared this with my mother.
04/12/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes we understand the expenses of studying as an international student without a scholarship especially when you want to achieve high quality education.
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Exactly, Please let me explain it to you again in brief! <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodati

04/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I am not sure if they can but maybe they can try.
04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know !!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
04/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 155 8395: It is better that way however l do not know how it is done.

Given that opportunity, l really like it.
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
04/12/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
04/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes l believe l will benefit.
04/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
04/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes the projects provided will also sharpen my knowledge in the market field and improve my skills.
04/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I am willing to work that hard and my family will not fail to raise the remaining amount.
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am happy to hear that!!
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
04/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Point number 4
04/12/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

04/12/23, 2:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
04/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 155 8395: My mother
04/12/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 155 8395: My family is willing to see me going abroad and they are encouraging me to pursue Edoofa scholarship
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mangoma, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes, and in addition to that the is also need for a
Visa
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Thank you
04/12/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/12/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
04/12/23, 2:30 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
04/12/23, 2:32 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Thank you
04/12/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 155 8395: We are through with the first stage
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
04/12/23, 2:40 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, 
*Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
04/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes I am
04/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 155 8395: I understand
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
04/12/23, 2:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
05/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes, thank you
05/12/23, 3:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: It is good to connect with you today, Mangoma,
I hope you are doing well
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss the Edoofa Program with your family, please?
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes l am. Hope you are doing well too.
05/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Yes I managed to.
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know, can you provide a summary of your family discussions regarding the Edoofa Scholarship Program and share their thoughts after learning more about the program
05/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 155 8395: We discussed. After the discussion my family kept encouraging me saying that the scholarship is good since it provides full information about their programs, the counselling session that they gave is very important to us since it gives us full information hence giving us full assurance that's it is a real thing and not associated with human trafficking.  They also outlined that it is also a good  scholarship since it offers jobs and that l should work hard.
05/12/23, 3:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Excellent, well it seems that you took your family through the entire conversation which we did during your counseling session! May I know if your family has any questions for me?
05/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 155 8395: They wanted to know if you also offer part time jobs which will sustain me whilst am doing my studies.
05/12/23, 3:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mangoma, Please note that India doesn't permit international students to do part-time jobs during their studies and this is the reason, we have the Earn While You Learn Program which is online offering students the opportunity to reduce their cost of education significantly based on their efforts and at the same time opening the opportunity to gain employability skills.
05/12/23, 3:59 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Okay. Thank you
05/12/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You are welcome, are you having other questions for me?
05/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 155 8395: For the five years of the course, is there a year of attachment.
05/12/23, 4:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please note that the duration of the course is 4 years and you can do your attachment in the final year
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Thank you.
05/12/23, 4:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mangoma, Is there anything else you would like to ask me regarding the program now?
05/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 155 8395: Nothing yet. Thank you

May I know the thoughts and opinions of your family regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please

06/12/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Mangoma and Ms. Loveness,
I hope that you both are doing well
06/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 155 8395: Yes we are well. Thank you
06/12/23, 9:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
06/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 77 263 4652: We are well
06/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 78 155 8395: Yes we did.
06/12/23, 9:46 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that
06/12/23, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
06/12/23, 9:47 am - Pallika Edoofa: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
06/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 155 8395: Yes l am looking forward to have that opportunity.
06/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 155 8395: That's why l am seeking for this opportunity.
06/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that
06/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Mangoma, Before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me?
06/12/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: 1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?

6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.
