22/11/23, 12:36 pm - Tushti: So, do you believe the family would eb ablr to raise around $2000 per year for Advent's higher studies abroad?
22/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 402 9090: To be honest I'm able to raise at least $1000 per given we have  2 other children. A bit challenging.
22/11/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: I see
