30/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 534 4045: Hello there...
30/10/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Prince, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
30/10/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: I hope this helps you understand?
30/10/23, 11:24 am - Tushti: Let me clarify your doubts using a video. Please go through it properly <This message was edited>

30/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 534 4045: Yeah now I understand but as for me my family is very poor and also as I've said earlier my parents are separated so there are many financial difficulties I think you do understand what I mean . So can you please kindly help me to know how much is the money I'll be supposed to pay for the study ...
30/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 534 4045: Wow this is awesome Ms Tushti there are some of the questions that I had before but through this video I'm adequately answered but I still have some things to ask....
30/10/23, 11:39 am - Tushti: I shall explain everything as we proceed with the session
30/10/23, 11:40 am - Tushti: Alright so Prince, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

14/11/23, 7:18 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
