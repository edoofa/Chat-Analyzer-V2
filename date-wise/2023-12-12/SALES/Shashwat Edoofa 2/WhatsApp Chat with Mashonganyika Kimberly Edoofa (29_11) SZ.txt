05/12/23, 12:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Mrs. Tendai! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
05/12/23, 12:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Tendai. However, since the coursework is extremely intrinsic for the evaluation, can you please share her previous term results?

11/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 77 498 8460: Will do so as soon as we have it on hand
11/12/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 498 8460: She wants to pursue medicine or anything in the medical field which is why she chose to do Maths, Biology and Chemistry for A level.
11/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Mrs. Tendai, could you please share why Kimberly didn't pursue Physics in her A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science subject, isn't it? <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 498 8460: Well she had a D in Physics and a D in Chemistry so after Biology and Maths she was given and option to choose one of the two Ds subjects, and her teachers encouraged her to take Chemistry because they thought she was better in Chemistry than she was in Physics
11/12/23, 6:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
11/12/23, 7:22 pm - +263 77 498 8460: I was not aware.Noted though.thank you.
11/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Tendai. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with Kimberly's A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
