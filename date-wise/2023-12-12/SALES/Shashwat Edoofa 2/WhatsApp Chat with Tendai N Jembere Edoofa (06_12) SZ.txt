Could you shed some light on what kind of student do you feel your daughter is, what are her strengths and weaknesses and how would you describe your child as a person, please?
06/12/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 857 3350: I'm I'm tendai jembere's father and husband to S Angelina Makoni. We are a small educated family. We have three kids. Jesca Jembere, courage Jembere and tendai jembere. My wife, she is a professional teacher, teaching at primary Level. My first born she is a nurse here in Zimbabwe and my son is also a teacher. Teaching is like genetics within our family, I'm also a teacher. However the economic situation on our country is not favorable so we are financial constrained but we have been trying for tendai and we managed to pay for her secondary level and she passed both O and  A level studies 

Tendai is a hard working girl a well behaved daughter. She strive by all means to succeed in life and she made us proud when she passed here o and A level studies. With this opportunity coming we are more than happy, she is showing that she can't give up on her academic journey  even tho we are financially crippled. Again as the father I'm not giving up on her we will push harder for tendai to achieve her goals

Tendai she is a kind hearted person, who is value free she can accommodate everyone and she always do good to others. 

Like everyone she got her weaknesses, she works too hard to achieve her goals she can't rest if she wants to achieve something. I concidered that as a weakness. However all in all I see her as a very strong women... and she will prosper and never disappoint us
06/12/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 857 3350: I have a diploma in education together with my wife. Our whole life we have been teaching. So education is of great importance in our family,  and it was easy for us to groom our children. We encouraged them to focus more on education. 

I think tendai started to develop interest in agriculture long back probably because we live in rural area where agriculture is the only basic area which gives us money and food. Therefore to her learning and studying agriculture will help her and the community to utilise the land and commercializing agriculture for the betterment of everyone  and it helped here to choose agriculture at A level and now willing to do it at university level.

Mostly during this period Mrs Angelina together with our first daughter paid using their salaries and loans from banks. Sometimes relatives also helped us especially when she was doing A level. I also provided little amount to her fees since I had some financial problems.
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 857 3350: The fees were paid United states dollars yet government was paying us in local currency so it was bit harder for us

07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok learning abroad is not something unique but it's something special and of great importance, particularly in India at your institution. Through her friend Fungai who assisted her and shared a lot about Edoofa scholarship we were satisfied and  encouraged tendai to apply.

 What motivates us more is quality of education abroad which is incomparable with what we are getting here in Africa.  There is a lot of exposure in India which will be very helpful for tendai and other if she manage to study there and come back home 

Again as a Parent it's commendable to support your child aspiration and allow her to follow her dreams. She always wanted to study abroad and with this opportunity coming we had no choice, but to support her. 

Concidering this interaction with you (Edoofa) we are even motivated more than before and we are willing to do what it takes to send Tendai to India and study we are feeling safe as if she will be studying here in Zimbabwe. ..

Most importantly we need Tendai to have a brighter future and your organization we believe will provide and give Tendai the future she needs

Due to limited opportunities in our country she informed us that agriculture will help her since Zimbabwe is an agro based economy and there is vast of land however without enough knowledge and education in the agriculture sector agriculture is or will become worthless.

08/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 857 3350: So from your assessment This program is the best for Tendai or it's optional
08/12/23, 4:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. Embarking on a journey with a Bachelor of Arts in Geography opens doors to a seamless transition into the dynamic field of agribusiness. The interdisciplinary nature of geography, encompassing environmental science, human geography, and spatial analysis, equips graduates with valuable skills applicable to the agribusiness sector. With a holistic understanding of Earth's physical and human landscapes, graduates can comprehend agricultural systems, analyze spatial data for optimal crop selection using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and contribute to sustainable practices. The acquired skills in market analysis, rural development, and environmental sustainability during a geography degree directly align with the demands of the agribusiness industry. Opportunities for further studies, such as pursuing a master's in agribusiness management, environmental management, or agricultural economics, enable individuals to deepen their expertise and tailor their knowledge to specific facets of agribusiness, ensuring a successful and impactful career in this vital sector!
08/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok thank you I think tendai will be happy to hear this

In agribusiness, India stands as a beacon of innovation, seamlessly blending traditional wisdom with modern techniques.

08/12/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok sir I have exhausted the information. Very motivated only if got the chance I could have studied in India. Hope my daughter will make it happen
08/12/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 218 4623: I have gone through all the information...l can confidently say l am even more interested in learning in India after reading and understanding this information you shared sir
08/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?
08/12/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 218 4623: As you mentioned above, studying in India helps in Global recognition and career prospects... getting an Indian degree would make me recognisable globally. After studying in India many doors and opportunities will be open for me to explore and venture into my career globally and locally
08/12/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 218 4623: I would achieve my career goals by getting opportunities to showcase the skills l intend to learn from india globally and locally at the same time using the knowledge to build my career into something that benefits others. I believe Indian education system will help me gain all the knowledge and skills l need to create a brighter future for me
08/12/23, 8:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
08/12/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 218 4623: No sir l am not familiar with that
08/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 747 4845: Maybe that can be our starting point if we can know the costs
08/12/23, 8:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tendai and Mrs. Angelina! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 8:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 8:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
08/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 857 3350: With edoofa giving a hand I think  reduced fee is reasonable and affordable considering it is payable in instalments.
08/12/23, 9:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. You will be delighted to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
08/12/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 857 3350: And if she can get a scholarship it will be better for us also
08/12/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 857 3350: No sir u can assist us, on how it is done. I think it will be very helpful
08/12/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
08/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
08/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
08/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
08/12/23, 9:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
08/12/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 857 3350: I think she will benefit from everything you shared concidering there is job security after graduating as well as variety of opportunities
08/12/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Again the program u offer eg earn while you learn. Is very helpful
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Tendai can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on her parents?
08/12/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 857 3350: This is very wonderful, and it requires the student to understand her or his background and stay focused to reduce the pressure on parents. I believe if this happens to tendai we will actually pay nothing as she will earn more and more through out the year. She is a hard worker
08/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok thank u
08/12/23, 9:49 pm - +263 78 218 4623: Thank you
09/12/23, 9:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The greatest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams." - Oprah Winfrey*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
09/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 218 4623: Good morning sir
09/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 77 857 3350: Ok. We can start
09/12/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Tendai and Mr. Courage!
09/12/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
09/12/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
09/12/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
09/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 857 3350: All the points are equally valuable and incomparable but for the sake of your question number 4 is appreciated most because it's always good to be guided from the beginning to the end.
09/12/23, 10:35 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mr. Courage! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
09/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 857 3350: We really appreciate
09/12/23, 11:00 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Tendai studying abroad?
09/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 857 3350: I'm excited, very happy and feel successful. I want my child to prosper and start her own life and new experience. There is fear and joy at the same time. Thinking that is it really happening are will able to make this happen. We are just curious
09/12/23, 11:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that she is diligent and possesses extreme valor. She will surely prove her mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, as I have mentioned before, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that she will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents!
09/12/23, 11:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
09/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 857 3350: Ok thank you
09/12/23, 11:47 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
09/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 77 857 3350: Yaa that's it
09/12/23, 11:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
09/12/23, 11:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
09/12/23, 11:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:50 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
09/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 857 3350: Ok understood
09/12/23, 12:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
09/12/23, 12:02 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok noted
09/12/23, 12:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
09/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Enwe in shot edoofa will cut the cost in various ways  including reduced fees through out the program further to this it allows us to pay in instalments. 350 kana be paid in instalments first 200 within 7 days. And if the application is don or assisted by edoofa it will be garanteed that the student will be enrolled.
09/12/23, 12:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.

09/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 857 3350: 01 that's where we are
09/12/23, 12:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Yes we can continue
09/12/23, 12:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 857 3350: It is clear. However on visa processing do we have to pay anything. And also how much the travelling cost to india
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 857 3350: From zimbabwe
09/12/23, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not flight tickets because the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe once or twice, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So, they learn and do internships during breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
(air fare :-around $400) is to be borne by the student which is mostly a one time investment.
09/12/23, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
09/12/23, 1:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

09/12/23, 1:10 pm - +263 77 857 3350: No so when are we supposed to pay the application fee so that we can budget for it
09/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. If the student is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship and receives the Acceptance Letter from The Academic Board, then only you have to commence the financial process, please.
09/12/23, 1:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer, please?
09/12/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 857 3350: No sir everything is clear now
09/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It was my pleasure assisting you, Mr. Courage!

11/12/23, 9:04 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I trust that you've had the opportunity to discuss the points mentioned above with your family. I'm here to assist with any questions they may have. Would it be agreeable to proceed with your application now?
11/12/23, 9:06 am - +263 77 857 3350: Morning
11/12/23, 9:09 am - +263 77 857 3350: We discussed at length. So on the application edoofa will do that through the counselor? Is tendai required to do anything during application?

11/12/23, 9:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. Tendai will be indulging in an academic interview with the director, please.
11/12/23, 9:17 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
11/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 218 4623: 1.  Bachelor of Arts in Geography.

2. India.

3. $6000 - $8000

4. If found eligible for the program the fee to be payed would be $2000 -$ 3000

5. The enrollment fee for the edoofa program is $350.

6. The first part of the enrollment fee is payed in 7 days.

7. Yes sir.
11/12/23, 9:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are parents ready for the same, please?
11/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 77 857 3350: Yes
11/12/23, 9:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly acknowledge the same using voice notes, please?
11/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 857 3350: From your guidance, we are able to pay 2000-3000 annual fee. I think for us 2000 will be ideal
11/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 857 3350: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/12/23, 9:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/12/23, 9:58 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:59 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023 for $200 and the 18th or 19th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 857 3350: We need to discuss with the family first on this one so that we give you a correct answer on when to pay but I think the  first option will be better  one
11/12/23, 10:19 am - +263 77 857 3350: Is 18 December the only dead line in case we fail to raise the same amount by next week.
11/12/23, 10:55 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. The tentative deadlines would be around the 18th or 19th December 2023 for $200, please.
11/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 857 3350: Ok will try to get that amount
11/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 857 3350: It is needed after the eligible test right?
11/12/23, 11:05 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mr. Mr. Courage. May I know which option is more convenient for you, please?
11/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 857 3350: The first one
11/12/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 857 3350: Number 1

11/12/23, 11:41 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Considering that you have provided comprehensive answers to all the inquiries, the next step in the process involves scheduling a video call with the Program Director. Once I submit the evaluation report for the application of Tendai, I will promptly arrange suitable time slots for the video call. Could I inquire about your availability for tomorrow to proceed with this arrangement?
11/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 857 3350: Yes we can do that tomorrow
11/12/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 857 3350: Video call does it involve all of us or tendai only. If tendai I wld like confirm with her.
11/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 77 857 3350: Or it's a group call
11/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Courage. The video call will be conducted with the parents, please.
11/12/23, 12:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know what time frame is suitable for you, please?
11/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok it's ok
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Tuesday will be ideal if we can
11/12/23, 12:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mr. Courage. May I know what time will be convenient for you tomorrow, please?
11/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 857 3350: 10 am
11/12/23, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Your interview has been scheduled for 10:00 A.M. CAT Time tomorrow. Please set an alarm to ensure you're available at least 10 minutes before the call. Also, make the necessary preparations for a video call. Please note that the director will only conduct the interview once, and missing it may lead to application cancellation. Best of luck!
Additionally, we'll be sharing a letter from our Honorable Director, Mr. Abhinav Gupta, with parents before the interview. Please make sure to go through the document, and as parents, acknowledge it using a voice note.
11/12/23, 12:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session tomorrow at 09:00 AM CAT as my working hours are over for the day.

11/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 857 3350: Ok ok no problem
