11/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 197 9498: Well  my main drive for studying abroad comes from the issue of Market... growth abroad.  Looking at some of the programs or degrees done in universities for example sociology....in economies like the one in Zimbabwe or most of the African countries it is very difficult to find real market for that kind of a job here . According to my research I have discovered that programs such as law , engineering,  tourism.... these ones still have a grip on the market especially abroad in countries with huge  economies
11/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 197 9498: Hence I think it is best to study abroad to have an advantage in market as well as due to technology advancement it is very easy to carry out researches as well as projects in these programs

11/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 197 9498: Well honestly speaking from childhood I have always loved tourism... I have always loved to travel. Going on a school educational trip to the Eastern Highlands in Zimbabwe can also be described as the fuel that generated more love for it.
11/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 197 9498: Through seeing different documentaries concerning the different parts of the world I have also loved the idea even more... however due to the still heart for others I intend to make it a dream come true for the less privileged
