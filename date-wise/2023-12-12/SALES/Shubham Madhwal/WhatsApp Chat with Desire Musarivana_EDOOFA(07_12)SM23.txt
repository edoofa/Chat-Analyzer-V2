11/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 133 7677: 1) Personal growth and expanding my horizons motivated me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program.I viewed scholarships as an opportunity to learn new skills,meet new people and broaden my perspective in the world
2)My understanding is in india students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like internet for around $40 for the whole year
