*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Kudzaishe?*
16/11/23, 4:25 pm - +263 71 543 8646: I saw that Edoofa is a good and different university compared to the universities that we have here in Zimbabwe. It has safe and welcoming environment and high quality education compared to our universities that we have in Zimbabwe. It also shows that Edoofa moulded the behaviour of the students as it stated that it involves parents and be punctual to schedule of your counsellor . I also understood that Edoofa has an affordablilty tuition and it offers high quality education than our universities that we have here . Edoofa offers both scholarship and Sponsorship but it only gives scholarships to the previledges but those who cannot afford Scholarship may get Sponsorship

I am Mr Shubham, The Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa. 

I am here to discuss the application of Simeon

Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
20/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 314 6326: Good morning. 

It's my pleasure having conversation with you.

Of recently I have heard that there is a scholarship program called Edoofa that is assisting students to study in India.
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
20/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
20/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Thank yu giving me more information about Edoofa. I'm now enlightened.
20/11/23, 12:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000+ students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe who is also our associate and is the Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

*United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High*, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s,*Shalom Academy*, Christ Ministries, *Advent Hope Academy*, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
20/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Great news.
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa
I'm sure you would be very much happy to be a part of your child's career counselling sessions. As we are interacting for the very first time, can you tell me a bit more about yourself, your highest education, your profession and what motivates you to support your child to study abroad?
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Tru that. I'm a holder of Bachelor of Commerce Honors Degree in Finance from National University of Science and Technology 2013. I'm currently working as an Audit Clerk at Binga Rural District Council. .

Considering the current educational systems we are having in Zimbabwe, i would be very happy for Simeon to study abroad as he will be able to explore a lot into his career provided adequate resources are availed to him as we lack resources hence enhanced accademic experience.
Studying abroad will assist in making better decision as one will be having a seen HOW OTHERS ARE DOING THINGS  thus unlocking new greater possibilities that we are not realizing today in our community. 
Studing abroad will also enhance personal growth and gives an expanded cultural awareness.
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: It is indeed a pleasure to be connected with you, *Mrs Tinotenda Wamedzwa*, so I hope you know that the Edoofa Program makes higher education affordable through financial aid and how it helps the students make a financial plan to ensure their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

I believe that is exactly what you are looking forward to from the program for *Simeon*, right?
20/11/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 314 6326: Indeed
20/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Now *Simeon*, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
20/11/23, 6:52 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

21/11/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 543 8646: My name is Simeon Wamedzwa. I am a gentleman aged twenty-two  . I am currently studying my Advanced level (Lower 6). I completed my ordinary level in 2022 and I obtained six subjects. These subjects include English language, History, Heritage studies, Shona, Commerce and Family and Religious Studies.                        I want to be a journalist. I have got my own parents but unfortunately my father died when I was young and my mother is a single mother and she's not working .                 My guardian who is my sister in law is a audit clerk and she is currently working at Binga Rural District Council. Her highest education level it's Tertiary level. She is the one who is responsible for my fees , welfare  and all necessities. My sister in law would be responsible for my Tertiary level .                      I have five elder brothers and two young brothers. The two young brothers are still learning to a certain school in rural areas, however, the other five are not gainfully employed since they have failed to reach better level in their fields due to financial constraints.            Currently, I am a student at Binga High School in Matabeleland  North, province. I am doing Literature in English, History and Family and Religious Studies

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
22/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 543 8646: I once was a student at Chipendeke Secondary School in Masvingo province from 2016 upto 2019. This is school is located under Bikita District and it is in rural areas. But unfortunately,I failed to pass since I used to walk a long distance to school . This meant that I had not enough time to study. This school helped me to be a better person in the community and at school since we used to have guidance and counselling sessions with the elders of the community and other senior teachers who were incharge of shaping and moulding the students' behaviour. There after I appointed as a senior prefect in 2018 where I targeted at shaping the behaviour of the juniors and other fellow students.            In 2019, I joined volleyball and Netball club where  I trained as a coach . There after I decided to repeat my Ordinary level last year.                In 2022 , I decided to join scripture union,drug and abuse compaign as well as cleaning up compaign at Binga High School. I did this because I had greater understanding on dangers of taking drugs ,promoting good hygiene at school and many more. This made me to be a good student and to be popular in the community and at school.

I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

Additionally, journalism can be a very rewarding career for me , since it would cultivates the spirit of patriotism. It also enables me to be more vexed with the current affairs.

05/12/23, 5:14 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/12/23, 5:19 pm - +263 71 543 8646: Yes am sure I will going to have better points
05/12/23, 6:28 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>

07/12/23, 4:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation. Till then please take care.

08/12/23, 12:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
08/12/23, 12:41 pm - +263 71 543 8646: It's because I would get an opportunity to get job after studying my course as compared to my country, I can get an opportunity to work outside the country as I compared with my country since there is high rate of unemployment. I want to create relationship and friendship with different people,I also want to improve my English command as I would socialise with different people with different languages. The other reason is education level ,we are now used to learn our native things so I would like to change that system . It also give me an opportunity to experience some new cultures and learn about the ways of life. It provide the chance to improve language skills and endede up building strong communication with different people.  Studying abroad gives me a great chance to experience the standard of living . Studying abroad lead to personal growth and developments ,as it often requires students to step outside of their comfort zone and learn to adapt to a new environment. Lastly to travel and explore a new  part of world.
08/12/23, 1:15 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
08/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 543 8646: No accept Edoofa
08/12/23, 1:18 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
08/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 543 8646: No
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
08/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*

11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.
