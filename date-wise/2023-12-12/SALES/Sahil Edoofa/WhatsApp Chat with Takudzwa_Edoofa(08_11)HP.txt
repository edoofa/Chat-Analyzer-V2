08/11/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: That's great, now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
08/11/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
08/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 391 9609: we are really happy about,such information coming from you,last year we could hardly apply due to financial constrains,but this time let us help each other so that Takudzwa will be part of your students
08/11/23, 4:42 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words and efforts for Takudzwa.
08/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thank you madam,but the current situation in our beloved Zimbabwe is a bit tough i hope and trust you shall help us through
08/11/23, 4:53 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr Tapera, Senior Academician Mr. Piyush was in Zimbabwe for about 90 days. He had the privilege of meeting many Zimbabwean students who had applied for the Edoofa Program back in 2018-2019. However, at that time, they didn't proceed because they were enticed by the prospect of earning quick money in the country. This year, when they met him, they shared how difficult things have been for them. Some of them, despite holding reputed degrees from UZ, MSU, and HIT, are working as petrol attendants, while others have started careers as mobile/laptop repair technicians. Some were facing even more challenges, resorting to selling Ecocash, Simcards, or vegetables.

Observing this scenario, Mr. Piyush saw many of them regretting not seizing the opportunity when they had the chance. So, what you are sharing, I can understand that, in reality, things are much more challenging over there.
08/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 391 9609: You see madam is there any chance that Takudzwa can work and learn at the same time because here things are becoming tough on a daily basis
08/11/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: I understand please and we shall discuss
08/11/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Tapera before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you and Mrs Gloria better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
08/11/23, 5:09 pm - +263 77 391 9609: ok Madam
08/11/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Please
08/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 391 9609: alright Madam
08/11/23, 5:13 pm - Harmehak: You can address the same please.
08/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 391 9609: im a peasant farmer and Gloria is a teacher,and Takudzwa is very brilliant in Sciences and you offer a wide range of Science programs
08/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Well received Mr Tapera, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself.
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thank you
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue however I will be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 11:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile you can go through the shared video please.
08/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 391 9609: afternoon
09/11/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: How are you doing today Mr Tapera?
09/11/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 391 9609: Im fine madam
09/11/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great.

Were you able to go through the shared video please?
09/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 391 9609: my network here is very bad,its very unfortunate
09/11/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please

You can go through the video once you are in a stable network in that case.
09/11/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: May I know Takudzwa's current Subject combination at A level please?
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i will make efforts to download it Madam
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 391 9609: Maths,Physics,and Chemistry
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
09/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 391 9609: yes we had to make him pass we are trying to make him go for extra lessons so that he will get maximum points though things are hard,but as parents we are trying our best to make him pass
09/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: It's great to know that you are putting efforts to support him, Mr Tapera!

So do you have any other children beside Takudzwa?
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 391 9609: yes we got two little girls,one is doing grade 5,and the other is 3 years old
09/11/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: It's a pleasure to know about them please.
09/11/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Mr Tapera, Takudzwa is a student at Glen View high, isn't it?
09/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 391 9609: ok
09/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 391 9609: yes Madam
09/11/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: I would like to mention that Edoofa is proudly associated with the same and we have students who would be coming to India as well.
09/11/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thats my prayer for him to win the scokarship
09/11/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: We look forward to the same.

So Mr Tapera, would you agree studying abroad would require financial support for Takudzwa?
09/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 391 9609: with the current situation prevailing in our beloved country financial support is of great concern
09/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: While I do understand the same Mr Tapera!

So how are you planning Takudzwa's higher education?
09/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 391 9609: when will be the intake,so that with the little we got we can save up to that time,we want him to persue with education
09/11/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me address the same!

Is Takudzwa currently a Lower 6 or Upper 6 student please?
09/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 391 9609: he is upper 6
09/11/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: The intake is of next year August please.
09/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 391 9609: Ok,i hope he would pass well,and im praying for maximum points
09/11/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great!

So are you willing to support Takudzwa financially please?
09/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 391 9609: The thing here madam is that looking for a scolarship means my finances are not stable,it is my great pleasure if you can chip in and help,with the little we got it will be very difficult,
09/11/23, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Now while I do understand the same, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
09/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 391 9609: well said
09/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 391 9609: with my position now as a peasant farmer i would opt for sponsorship añd i think Takudzwa is free and willing to do anything for the organisation sponsoring him
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: I understand please,

However Edoofa is a scholarship program please.
09/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 391 9609: its fine madam 

i really understand
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, now let me share a document with you for your even better understanding.
09/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 391 9609: ok
09/11/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i hope by next year August,Takudzwa will be part of your team
09/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same.
09/11/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Kindly go through the document and inform me once done.
09/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 391 9609: alright Madam
09/11/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 391 9609: im going through the document,let me have my time Madam
09/11/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.

09/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
09/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i will go through it whole night
09/11/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: Sure please
09/11/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thank you Madam have a splendid weekend and enjoy your festivals
09/11/23, 8:44 pm - Harmehak: Thank you, Mr Tapera.
09/11/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 391 9609: welcome Madam
13/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i had gone through this piece it is very informative and easy to understand
14/11/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
14/11/23, 12:28 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Yes we can
14/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: How are you doing today Takudzwa?

14/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Yes l went through it
14/11/23, 1:40 pm - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
14/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 859 2669: 1 Edoofa offers scholarships across the world for international students
2 Once under Edoofa the university fees becomes more affordable .As a student you can also do the earn while you learn programme helping you in paying your fees without involving parents
14/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Takudzwa.

What all did you understand regarding the finances involved?
15/11/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Firstly the annually university fees ranges from 7000 to 8000 but after the edoofa scholarship the fees falls to 2000 to 3000 per year
16/11/23, 9:12 am - Harmehak: Good morning Takudzwa
16/11/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 859 2669: Morning how are you?
16/11/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: I am doing well please,

16/11/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Yes please?
16/11/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 859 2669: Let us say l got the scholarship right but the programme l needed isn't the one on my scholarship or the one l dreamt of there is a twist will that be fair ???
16/11/23, 9:40 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate or rephrase?
16/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 859 2669: Let's say l applied for  mechanical engineering and the scholarship offer me chemical engineering which l didnt applied for will that be fair
16/11/23, 9:46 am - Harmehak: That's never the case please.

You would finalize your course and that's how you proceed.
16/11/23, 9:55 am - +263 78 859 2669: Some are saying that you won't get the programme you applied
16/11/23, 10:00 am - Harmehak: I shared that you would get the program you applied for if you qualify for its requirements!

The program won't be changed by the scholarship.

You yourself can change the program if you wish to.
16/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 859 2669: Ok now l understand thank you
16/11/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask?
16/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you, now I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
17/11/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 859 2669: Morning
17/11/23, 9:53 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
17/11/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 859 2669: . Yes we can start
17/11/23, 10:09 am - Harmehak: So far are there any queries, Takudzwa?
17/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 859 2669: Noo l think l have asked enough
17/11/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Alright please,

So did you happen to discuss your learnings from the document with your parents?
17/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 859 2669: Yes l we discussed everything
17/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: That's great, so do you understand the following as well?
17/11/23, 11:23 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
17/11/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 859 2669: But for me my parents said if it's 2000 to 3000 it will unaffordable
17/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 859 2669: So through the earn while you learn program can l cover my whole annual fees
17/11/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: I understand
17/11/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Takudzwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
17/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 859 2669: Now it's understandable
17/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 859 2669: I fully agree
17/11/23, 11:42 am - Harmehak: So may I know how exactly are you planning your higher education even if you stay in Zimbabwe, Takudzwa?
17/11/23, 12:06 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Here in Zimbabwe l am planning to study engineering if the Edoofa program doesn't work out it is quite easier to study in your country of birth than overseas
17/11/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, however given the finances for Zimbabwe, who would be supporting your education financially please?
17/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 859 2669: My parents will be supporting me financially
17/11/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: When did you discuss with them regarding the same please?
17/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 859 2669: About 5 months ago when l started this counseling sessions
17/11/23, 4:02 pm - Harmehak: Didn't you discuss with them yesterday or today, Takudzwa?
17/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT, do ensure active participation so that we can conclude the counseling session and proceed with further stages.

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead!
18/11/23, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?

18/11/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: However yesterday itself you shared that the fee is unaffordable.

Can you elaborate on that?
18/11/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 859 2669: Yes comparing that $2000 to $3000 per to here in Zimbabwe the fees is about $1000 per year with everything  food and stuff without a scholarship, my parents are unable to raise that kind of amount as their jobs are not highly paying jobs
18/11/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Takudzwa, aren't these the costs of education in Zimbabwe including everything?
18/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 859 2669: In zimbabwe accommodation is much cheaper compared to India and food is much affordable
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Takudzwa?
18/11/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: You agreed, isn't it?

Regarding the costs of education and living expenses.
18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected?

@263788592669 @263773919609
18/11/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting to hear from you during the session however I understand there must be some reason due to which you were unable to get back to me.

I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 10 AM CAT* since already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
20/11/23, 8:13 am - +263 77 391 9609: good morning Madam,our network here is poor i went through the document its very understandable

20/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 391 9609: he wants Mechanical Engineering
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
20/11/23, 2:25 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about his desired course.
20/11/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

20/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i wish Takudzwa to be part of your students
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to him joining our Proud Edoofians too!
20/11/23, 2:48 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Mr Tapera.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 391 9609: not familiar at all
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 391 9609: yes Madam
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 391 9609: By the look of things India is the best
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
20/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i also appreciate your kind heart
20/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 391 9609: this could be affordable with the Earn While You Learn Program i hope Takudzwa will do that without any problem
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Yes please.

It's a choice for every student and they start from Zimbabwe itself with the Earn While You Learn Program.
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 391 9609: what can we do to join
20/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 391 9609: well said
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: He would join as soon as he is accepted into the program please.

You would be guided with the process too.
20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

20/11/23, 3:22 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i will be very proud if Takudzwa join you
20/11/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please!
20/11/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 391 9609: it is a very good program,especially for Takudzwa
20/11/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 391 9609: if it is like that it will be affordable
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
20/11/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

20/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 391 9609: very clear now it is now our duty as Takudzwa's parents to work through thick and thin to have money for this scholarship but with God everything is possible
20/11/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Mr Tapera!

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
20/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 391 9609: this program is so amazing i hope and trust Takudzwa will excéed all these credits
20/11/23, 5:33 pm - +263 77 391 9609: im ready only that maybe our network here but im ready
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: I understand
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Takudzwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
20/11/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 391 9609: it will be $1500-$2250
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Mr Tapera, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
20/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 391 9609: understood so it means it is not easy to be admitted when you apply for one university
20/11/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: That's the case for a student who applies himself which is without Edoofa.
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 391 9609: this is affordable
20/11/23, 5:46 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i understand madam
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
20/11/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thats great
20/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thank you very much for this information
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your acknowledgement.
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
20/11/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
20/11/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 391 9609: very clear
20/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
20/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
20/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
20/11/23, 6:01 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 391 9609: thats great news
20/11/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
20/11/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 6:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

20/11/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
20/11/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth, Mr Tapera.
20/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 391 9609: ok
20/11/23, 6:17 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i will definitely
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
20/11/23, 6:32 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

21/11/23, 12:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
21/11/23, 12:58 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Let's proceed
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Hello sir
21/11/23, 1:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
21/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Yes she did address them well .
21/11/23, 3:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 391 9609: i contacted her and she insisted that Édoofa is second from none,thàt as for now she's encouraging us as parents to get that scholarship,and i hope Takudzwa will be part of your team
21/11/23, 6:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?
7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
21/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 391 9609: 1.Mechanical Engineering
2.India
3.$6000-$8000/year

21/11/23, 8:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What is not clear in question 7 ?
21/11/23, 9:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:37 am - +263 77 391 9609: i wanted to say Yes
22/11/23, 11:56 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
22/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 391 9609: very fine afternoon Sir
22/11/23, 2:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are your parents ready for the same?
22/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Yes they are very ready
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th November 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 859 2669: Option 1 is understandable
22/11/23, 5:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents please answer using voice notes.
