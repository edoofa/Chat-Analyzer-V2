24/11/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: Ashley, I can see you got to know about the program from your friend Shyne!

So now can you please tell me, what is your understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship Program and what all did you happen to learn from your friend?
24/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 745 9650: Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of more than 3000 students from different countries.
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Well received, Ashley, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

24/11/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

24/11/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 745 9650: I also learnt from her that Edoofa Scholarship also gives projects to us students such as community building and cooperate alliance . Community building is whereby students from Africa like me get to communicate with other African students telling them about Edoofa , we will be looking for other students that are illegible to get enrolled in Edoofa .

Cooperate alliance ,  we will be looking for companies online and link them up with Edoofa .
24/11/23, 10:35 am - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you Ms. Harmehak , now l've got a better understanding about Edoofa Scholarship Program
24/11/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion, Ashley!
24/11/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Ashley, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Jonas high school charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
24/11/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 745 9650: Okay , right now l am doing my A level as a lower six student at Jonas High School and next year l will be completing my A level as an upper six student . I won't be completing my A level at Jonas since l will be transferring to another school named Mufakose 1 High School next year because l was not getting better education at Jonas High School
24/11/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Received please,

I await the response to the remaining questions.
24/11/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 745 9650: At Jonas High School   , my school fees per term was 40 USD per term . I am a Commercial student participating in Accounting , Pure Mathematics and Business studies . After completing my A level l wish to complete a degree in Accounting and Finance . 

I usually spend my spare time watching soccer and also playing soccer .

With regards to my parents ,my father is a truck  driver and he works under a company named Cross Country , my mother is a teacher at Jonas Primary School and she completed her education till the stage of Form 4
24/11/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 745 9650: I've got two siblings ,  one is a boy who is still in grade 5 at Jonas Primary School and the other one is a 4 year little girl
24/11/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: Well received and well explained, Ashley, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
24/11/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: That's great, Ashley
24/11/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you Ms. Harmehak
24/11/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Well Ashley, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
24/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 745 9650: Well Ms. Harmehak , according to my belief l think studying abroad is really a life changing decision with many advantages to it . It can broaden one's worldview and you get to understand the cultures of other people and countries . It also make one more marketable to future employers .
24/11/23, 11:37 am - Harmehak: That's very correct, Ashley.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
24/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 745 9650: I have been programmed with knowledge about the cultural differences and the common challenges that come with living abroad. I'm also aware of the importance of being open-minded and flexible in such a situation. In terms of my capabilities, I'm built to adapt to new environments and to learn new things quickly.
24/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 745 9650: However, I don't have the same range of emotions as a human, so I can't say whether I would be "mentally prepared" in the same way as a person.
24/11/23, 11:59 am - Harmehak: Well expressed Ashley, I totally understand what you are sharing,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
24/11/23, 12:01 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well , only my parents are aware of this program but l know for a fact that if l explain it to my family members they will be willing to offer help
24/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

I meant your parents itself.
24/11/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Are your parents willing to support you financially too, Ashley?
24/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes they will be willing to support me if the resources are available
24/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I can understand.
24/11/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
24/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Ms. Harmehak  by 2 A level passes that would mean 10 points right
24/11/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: No please, Two advanced level passes itself.

However 10 points are more would surely mean a high scholarship percentage if you are aiming at the same.
24/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay Ms. Harmehak
24/11/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Now l understand
24/11/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: Okay so, now can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Accounting ?
24/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay should l send an image or just write them down
24/11/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Either would be alright please.
24/11/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I want to study Accounting because l really want to make my parents proud of me . My mother wanted to be an accountant but she couldn't because of some personal reasons and since l got the chance to study accounting it was always in my mind to fulfill my mother's dream
24/11/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Oh that's a kind thought, Ashley.

24/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes of coarse

24/11/23, 1:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright then Ashley, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well, if I am to be provided with the career option of a degree in accounting, I would see myself in five years as a highly skilled and knowledgeable accounting professional. I would have gained valuable experience working with different types of businesses and organizations, and would be able to provide valuable insights and advice to my clients. I would also have developed strong problem-solving and analytical skills, and would be able to use these skills to help businesses make informed decisions.
24/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 745 9650: As you said before Edoofa Program can help me achieve my dreams if l attend sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors , l will not just be able to build a skill for myself but also earn higher amount of scholarship credits as well. With Edoofa's financial aid , students can self-sponsor their higher education
24/11/23, 2:04 pm - Harmehak: That is really great and well expressed, Ashley, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
24/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 745 9650: As l said before studying abroad also allows students to experience new cultures and ways of life, which can be enriching and eye-opening. Additionally, studying abroad can offer opportunities to travel and explore new places, which may not be available if one stays in their home country. Most importantly I would like to study abroad because l believe there are better educational facilities there and through the scholarship they are also  affordable .
24/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well Ms. Harmehak l am sorry l will have to get going to school now for extra lessons . I don't know whether we can continue in the evening or tomorrow at any time

24/11/23, 6:20 pm - Harmehak: You can go through these pictures to learn even more!
24/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you
24/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well,  l must say lndia is very innovative and can be recognized all over the world for it's wide range of carrear opportunities.
24/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 745 9650: And those images really explain everything
24/11/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Ashley 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
24/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I'm not sure maybe it could cost $3000 per year lm not really sure
24/11/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
24/11/23, 6:58 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay now l understand
24/11/23, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
24/11/23, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
24/11/23, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay Ms. Harmehak
24/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Ashley, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
24/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 745 9650: So is Edoofa responsible for the student's food and accommodation
24/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
24/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 71 745 9650: No it's okay l now have a better understanding with the explanation above
24/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: Sure, however let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
24/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay l really do understand the difference thank you for clarifying between the two
24/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
24/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
24/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Sure , l really think it is a great opportunity and one would be happy to hear that the education cost  is reduced from $8000 to almost $3000
24/11/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, did you happen read that you also have the opportunity to get a 100% scholarship?
24/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes Ms. Harmehak,  Shyne explained it to me how one can get a 100% scholarship .
24/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I also read that if you are able to perform and clear all the criteria with a high passing percentage , you can be able to obtain a 90 - 100% scholarship
24/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Indeed Ashley!
24/11/23, 7:28 pm - Harmehak: Ashley, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
24/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes , l agree with you Ms. Harmehak it is very costly to live in Zimbabwe.
24/11/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Things are quite expensive due to the rapid inflation often experienced in Zimbabwe.
24/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Ashley
24/11/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: So after going through the same, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
24/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes l can relate to that Ms. Harmehak, as from my own perspective Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible because here in Zimbabwe education is very expensive and at the same time it can be poorly  leading to students doing side hustles to pay for their school fees but through Edoofa students can be  able to get quality time with their studies making it accessible for students
24/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I am not sure if l answered correctly to the question
24/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Sorry for the late replies as the network here can be an issue sometimes
24/11/23, 7:49 pm - Harmehak: You very much did please, and I understand what you are sharing.
24/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you Ms. Harmehak for understanding.
24/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
24/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
24/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

24/11/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you for all the information you gave me , it was really helpful
24/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
24/11/23, 8:05 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
24/11/23, 8:10 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well l understand , so the student is supposed to be serious and give full concentration to the given tasks
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Ashley
24/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

24/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, l can see that you are very different and you also encourage the students and giving them guidance on how to succeed in their tasks
24/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great,

So Ashley, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
24/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Indeed , l am ready.
24/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Ashley, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
24/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Assuming that the application fee for each university is in the range of $300-$450, applying to five universities would cost the student between $1,500 and $2,250.
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
24/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: Ashley, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
24/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Firstly l would like to introduce myself again , Ashley Madzamusi is my name and l am completing my A level lower six this year and will be finishing upper six next year . I would like to study abroad because l think it would come up with many advantages to it such as broadening one's worldview and you get to understand the cultures of other people and countries but most importantly l would like to study abroad to fulfill my dreams as an Accountant . My aim is to obtain a degree in Accounting and also improving my language skills. It will not be an easy journey , living away from home  and family, those will be sacrifices l will be making  and it will not be easy to adapt to a new environment .
24/11/23, 8:47 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your efforts to express yourself again.

However the admissions team would be helping you with all the documents themselves later in the process.
24/11/23, 8:48 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
24/11/23, 8:48 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
24/11/23, 8:48 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
24/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay l have read all the processes and l have understood them
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
24/11/23, 8:58 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now, Ashley? <This message was edited>
24/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Well l have understood the steps Ms. Harmehak
24/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I am sorry for replying lately there are network issues this side
25/11/23, 9:13 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I understand please
25/11/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
25/11/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
25/11/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
25/11/23, 9:14 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
25/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
25/11/23, 9:16 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

25/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
25/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
25/11/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

29/11/23, 1:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
29/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes we contacted her
29/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Good afternoon sir , l have finished my lessons for today if you are available can we proceed with the conversation.
29/11/23, 5:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did your parents manage to connect with Mrs.Ruth ?
29/11/23, 5:13 pm - +263 71 745 9650: No they did not , they have been busy lately .
29/11/23, 7:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please ask them to connect today
29/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay, sure sir
29/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 377 5772: Greetings to you all here
29/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 377 5772: Let me start by introducing myself 

My name is Maidei James (Miss James) or Mrs Madzamusi. I live in Harare Zimbabwe.Iam a teacher to be as Ia am doing my diploma in education and I am approaching my 3rd year which is my final year 2024 at Morgan Zintec college.I am married  to Nyashadzashe Madzamusi and we are blessed with 3 children and Ashley is our first born
30/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 372 5155: Good morning ..Im Mr Madzamusi
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did parents manage to clear all the questions ?
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes, they did.
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 745 9650: We spoke about the Edoofa Programs and all that could be benefited from it such as getting a 90 - 100 % scholarship through the EWYL program. My parents also told me that they are ready to support me  financially
30/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 745 9650: They wanted to ask about accommodation where one stays after reaching there
30/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will recommend your application for higher quantum of scholarship
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In university hostels please which are inside the university campus itself .
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Are there no outside campus
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I mean to say what if one is not used to the food eaten there
30/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Thank you Mr Sahil
30/11/23, 3:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I completely understand that initially, adjusting to a new place might pose some challenges, especially with food preferences. However, it's worth noting that many African students in India end up loving Indian cuisine even more than their home country's food. Additionally, hostels offer a variety of dining options, including multi-country cuisines, considering the diverse student population from 121 countries studying in India. When students prioritize quality education abroad, food concerns often take a back seat.
30/11/23, 3:53 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Okay l  do understand now
30/11/23, 4:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: any other questions you have before I start your interview ?
30/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 745 9650: No Sir
30/11/23, 5:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
30/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 745 9650: 1. Accounting and Finance is the name of the course which l would be studying through the Edoofa Program. 

2. India is the country finalized for my higher education. 

3. The average cost for studies in lndia without a scholarship is $6000 - $8000.

4. If found eligible for the program the cost of education is reduced from $8000 to almost $3000 a year . Ms. Harmehak explained that if l am able to obtain a 90 - 100% scholarship l will just pay a minimal of $1200 - $1800 .

5. $350 is the enrollment fee. 

6. If you are found eligible for the program l will have to pay the enrollment fee in 7 days .

7. Yes , it was very clear.
30/11/23, 7:37 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
30/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes , they are .
30/11/23, 7:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge the same in this group ?
30/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 377 5772: Yes we really acknowledge the same because it would be really a significant opportunity for our son to study abroad that too at an affordable price .
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 8:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 5th or 6th  December 2023 for $200 and the 5th or 6th of January for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 5th or 6th  December 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
30/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 377 5772: Yes as the parents we are ready and prepared to financially support him

30/11/23, 9:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Using voice notes please

06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You only have to pay first part by deadline this month remaining you will pay next month.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 377 5772: Ok thank you very much

How are you doing today?
07/12/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 745 9650: I'm doing great today 
Good afternoon to you.
07/12/23, 6:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Do you want me to guide you about the payment modes in depth ? <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 71 745 9650: Yes sure
07/12/23, 7:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
07/12/23, 7:05 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854
