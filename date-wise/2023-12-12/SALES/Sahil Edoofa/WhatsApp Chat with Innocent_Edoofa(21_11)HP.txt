22/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Well received, so, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
22/11/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
28/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Ok  Madam lets discuss.
28/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 357 3521: According to my view if you really have a vision or objectives while being abroad it makes a difference and I strongly believe its a life changing decision.
28/11/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across, Innocent.

Would you add you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
28/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 357 3521: I need to fulfil my objectives and I am deeply committed in every circumstances that I will overcome even nomatter how hard studying will be I am truly prepared for a life abroad ,not just that but to work very hard to accomplish my dreams to make them come true.
28/11/23, 2:00 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Innocent,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well,my family is really aware of this and they agreed to support me on  both mentally and financially.
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Its alright mam no problem with that.
28/11/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Business ?
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well, do you mind if I can send my O level results immediately in   February when the certificates are out unfortunately my transcript was misplaced I hope you understand .
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: You can type them for now please, Innocent
28/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Commerce B , English B,history A ,Family religious education B , Agriculture C,Shona C, Geography B,Mathematics,B , Accounts B.
28/11/23, 8:41 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted, I await your response to the remaining part.
28/11/23, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Thursday at 12 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
29/11/23, 2:24 am - +263 71 357 3521: My Combination I'm studying is accounts , economics and business studies.
30/11/23, 2:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well it's amazing .
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Did you find the information helpful too, Innocent?
30/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Yaa I  found a variety of business that can be essential in employment opportunities I think it can be helpful too.
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Innocent.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - +263 71 357 3521: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Not really.
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Ok  understood.
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Innocent, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
30/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well , I will try to work on best grade for I would like to get 90 to 100 % as  my parents can  afford.
30/11/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great
30/11/23, 3:15 pm - Harmehak: Innocent, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
30/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well I agree
30/11/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?
30/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Yaa  I understand very well.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/11/23, 6:17 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

30/11/23, 6:27 pm - +263 71 357 3521: This is brilliant good creativity madam.
30/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please. <This message was edited>
30/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/11/23, 6:34 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Well it's very good ,I really like it it's helpful.
30/11/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
01/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Good afternoon ,can we continue please.?

01/12/23, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
02/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
02/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Good afternoon mam ,I followed the discussion its interesting and to a greater extent the program is very beneficial as I was going through it
02/12/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
02/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Yes I'm ready mam.
02/12/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: Innocent, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
02/12/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
02/12/23, 7:33 pm - +263 71 357 3521: $1500 _$2250 .
02/12/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
02/12/23, 7:34 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 7:35 pm - Harmehak: You see, Innocent, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Very well , it's not bad
02/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
02/12/23, 7:42 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
02/12/23, 7:46 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Ok  I understood.
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
02/12/23, 7:47 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
02/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 357 3521: Yes ,I understood very  well
02/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
02/12/23, 7:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/12/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
02/12/23, 8:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
03/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
03/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
03/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
