18/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 77 242 8203: No. 

Kindly note that I am a guardian to Stacey and I basically want to understand what Edoofa is all about and how it can assist a young student aspiring to get to University and the sponsorship programs/structures in place. 

Also the university study courses that it provides sponsorship support to
18/11/23, 11:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
18/11/23, 11:36 am - +263 77 242 8203: Thanks for the clarification. 

In this case what you actually offer is an international scholarship for studies in India, am I right?

20/11/23, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! Well, before we move ahead with your course discussion, can you please share your motivation behind studying abroad. Also please share pictures of your previous qualifications results for evaluation. Moreover, please mention the year of completion of A level as well?
20/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I have not completed my A level yet.
20/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge the other questions as well?
20/11/23, 4:59 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I believe there is not a more exciting privilege for a student to be able to discover new academic systems from new places.Studying abroad is the opportunity to discover oneself while gaining an understanding of a different culture.I believe that it enhances students self-awareness and understanding in their own culture by providing opportunities to compare and contrast host country customs, values, traditions with their own.In the process students get to meet new people with different backgrounds that are entirely different from their own and they learn to adapt to different situations.Getting to experience all of the above is what motivates me and is why I would like to study abroad.
20/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 242 8203: 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽 that's brilliant, we support you all the way!
20/11/23, 7:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is truly commendable, Mr. Charles!
20/11/23, 7:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Stacey! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!

01/12/23, 12:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
01/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 999 2252: According to research an international student should budget for at least $5000 to $10 000. <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Stacey! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
01/12/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
01/12/23, 1:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
01/12/23, 1:46 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Yes ,I feel that they will be able to afford the reduced fees.
01/12/23, 2:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Stacey. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
01/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Yes ,please.
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Stacey. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

01/12/23, 2:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
01/12/23, 2:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi

It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/12/23, 2:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
01/12/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I think the EWYL program is an excellent way of helping students to learn and develop skills necessary to excel in their careers.I trust that I will benefit much from the program . <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
01/12/23, 3:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

01/12/23, 3:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
01/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Wow,this is really impressive!
01/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 999 2252: May you kindly share more information about the specific aspects of projects that are given, please?
01/12/23, 4:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would kindly request you to go through this message, please.
01/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Okay.
01/12/23, 4:19 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Yes.
01/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
01/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
01/12/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I must say all of the above mentioned points are highly remarkable.However the point which fascinated me the most is the Earn While You Learn program.I was pleased to know that it is possible self-finance myself whilst attending to school.The program not only financially supports me during tuition but also helps to learn and develop and gain excellent working experience.
01/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability and employability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
01/12/23, 9:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
01/12/23, 10:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"The expert in anything was once a beginner." - Helen Hayes*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/12/23, 10:11 am - +263 78 999 2252: Good morning, I am ready.
02/12/23, 10:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Stacey!
02/12/23, 10:38 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this question?
02/12/23, 2:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
02/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Good afternoon.
02/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I was liaising with family on the matter and they advise that that would be a welcome opportunity and are quite supportive.
02/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
02/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
02/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Indeed these appear to be the most critical issues to cover in the process of applying.
02/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
02/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/12/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/12/23, 5:00 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Does the program fee increase on a monthly basis?
02/12/23, 5:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Stacey.
02/12/23, 5:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/12/23, 5:17 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Okay,noted.
02/12/23, 5:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
02/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 999 2252: I understood that Edoofa offers a program which is the Earn While You Learn program whereas student can earn scholarship credits in which they can use to reduce the burden of the cost of thier education.I also learnt that if a student is found eligible ,Edoofa pays part of the enrollment fee and the remaining $350 is paid by the student.
02/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 999 2252: The student is given a period of 7 days to pay the fee.However an alternative payment method is available,whereas a part of the fee ($200) can be paid within 7 days and the remaining balance of $150 can be paid within the next 30 days.
02/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
02/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2 changed the group name from "Stacey Rurayi Nyakabau Edoofa (14/11) SZ" to "Stacey Rurayi Nyakabau Edoofa (14/11) SZ 2025"
02/12/23, 6:46 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 999 2252: We have discussed all the above phases except phase 6.
02/12/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 999 2252: If I am not mistaken,I am currently in stage 2 in my application.
02/12/23, 7:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
02/12/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Yes, please.
02/12/23, 7:13 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
02/12/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Yes.
02/12/23, 7:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
02/12/23, 7:15 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

02/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 999 2252: When does the eligibility check take place?

02/12/23, 7:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I ask whether you have other queries that I can answer, please?

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

I hope your recent session with *Mr.Shashwat* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
04/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 78 999 2252: Good Morning.

04/12/23, 3:28 pm - +263 78 999 2252: The sessions were enjoyable.All went well to my satisfaction.
04/12/23, 5:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: ​​May I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members, and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
04/12/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 999 2252: We discussed as a family the importance of every member getting involved in the decision making process, particularly where it involves tertiary education. We therefore deliberated on their ability to meet the required fee payment standards and they gave their word that they would strive to their fullest to meet the demands. 

What they would like to ask is your forbearance in raising the funds in a harsh African economic environment as they strive to work out the best for their child's education. They wanted to find out if there is room for other concessionary payment terms
04/12/23, 8:32 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I appreciate the thorough family discussion, and it's commendable that everyone is actively participating in the decision-making process. Regarding your family's concerns about meeting the fee payment standards in the challenging economic environment, I completely understand the situation. Edoofa is committed to supporting students in their educational journey.

We acknowledge the economic challenges and We understand the importance of education, and our aim is to make it accessible. I would be more than willing to explore flexible payment options that align with your family's circumstances.
04/12/23, 8:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
04/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Not just yet. We wanted to reach a consensus as a family firstly and foremostly, have the conviction on our own then proceed to seek external reinforcement such as her experience and journey
04/12/23, 8:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Make sure your family connect with her and inform me ,  You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.

11/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
11/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Good afternoon 
I am doing well and you
11/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 999 2252: Kindly excuse me for the delay, the day was a repeat of the previous days, electricity challenges again and I couldn't communicate.
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023 for $200 and the 17th  or 18th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
11/12/23, 8:43 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I will connect with you *tomorrow again at 10:30 AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
