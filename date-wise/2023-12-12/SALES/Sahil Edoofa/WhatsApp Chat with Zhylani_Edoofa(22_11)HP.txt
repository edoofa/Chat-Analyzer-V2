22/11/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: I can see you have a drive, Zhylani!

That's wonderful!

Does science include physics and chemistry, Zhylani?
22/11/23, 3:25 pm - +260 779684925: Yes it does
22/11/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, so let me brief you about your desired course in that case.
22/11/23, 3:27 pm - +260 779684925: Sure thing
22/11/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech Civil Engineering: What is it About?*

Civil engineering is one of the oldest engineering disciplines in the world. Civil engineering, until a few decades back, was a much sought after course among Indian students, but lately has been sidelined due to the software and IT boom. However with the increasing need to develop and maintain India’s infrastructure, which is lagging in all aspects, this field is bouncing back strongly.

There are options for higher studies after the completion of B.Tech. course. Students can pursue Master’s degree in specialized course. Master of Technology (M.Tech.) in Civil engineering and other allied branches like-

*Structural Engineering*
*Architectural Engineering*
*Geotechnical Engineering*
*Environmental Engineering etc.*

*B.Tech Civil Engineering: Who should opt?*

Before you decide to pursue your undergraduate studies in this field, it is important to understand that Civil engineering is not just about buildings and bridges. If you are under the assumption that all that civil engineers do is wear a yellow helmet and supervise workers in construction sites, then you are yet to understand the true capacity of this field. 


*Career aspects*

In these cases, you will have to hunt for a core engineering job all by yourself through off-campus placements. Creating strong professional networks, developing a great resume with stellar GPA and doing impressive projects and internships will help you secure a job in one of the core civil engineering companies.

Also, civil engineers find work not just in construction industry, but also in other industries such as oil and energy, transportation, petroleum, environmental, power and electric utilities, chemical etc where infrastructure projects and construction facilities are involved. Some students transition to software, consulting or banking as they feel that salary and growth prospects are better in these sectors.
22/11/23, 3:31 pm - +260 779684925: Interesting
22/11/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: Alright so then Zhylani, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/11/23, 3:36 pm - +260 779684925: In the next 5 years I see myself seating with Sir Mokshangundum Visvesvaraya
22/11/23, 3:39 pm - +260 779684925: As one of the best engineers
Getting into Edoofa would be of good help to me in that I would expossed to very good teachers and I would also be in one of the best      Universities
22/11/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Zhylani, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
22/11/23, 3:41 pm - +260 779684925: I don't feel my country would offer the high education, I need to be one of the best to develop it
22/11/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: It's great to see that you are willing to put efforts for a promising future, Zhylani.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
22/11/23, 3:50 pm - +260 779684925: The  Bharatmala progect
The Char dham expressway
And the international north-south transport corridor
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - +260 779684925: These seem very Impressive from my perspective
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to see that you have knowledge, Zhylani.
22/11/23, 3:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

22/11/23, 4:04 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Zhylani!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - +260 96 7889730: No please share the cost line for our internets
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Sure please.
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:08 pm - +260 96 7889730: It’s manageable and affordable we are ready to proceed with such
22/11/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mr Nephan.

It's great to have you thoroughly following and acknowledging your support.
22/11/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
22/11/23, 4:14 pm - +260 779684925: This is impressive
22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 4:31 pm - +260 96 7889730: You are just an amazing institution please secure her studies and find her a university space
22/11/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words.

And we look forward to the same, Mr Nephan.
22/11/23, 4:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 4:33 pm - +260 96 7889730: It’s well
22/11/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 5:01 pm - +260 779684925: We will get back to y
22/11/23, 5:05 pm - +260 779684925: You
22/11/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Surely Zhylani!

Are there any queries please?
22/11/23, 5:51 pm - +260 779684925: Only one
What points is one required to get for the qualification
22/11/23, 5:54 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
22/11/23, 6:01 pm - +260 779684925: So for me to qualify is a must that I first have to do  A-levels
22/11/23, 6:07 pm - Harmehak: No please, you would be proceeding on the basis of provisional admissions now and start with your Earn While You Learn Program too!
22/11/23, 6:18 pm - +260 96 7889730: Let’s conclude the discussion have followed
22/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. It would be concluded in 10-15 minutes.
22/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: Mr Nephan, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/11/23, 6:28 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 6:58 pm - +260 96 7889730: Send me the banking details were remittance of funds for applying can deposited
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - Harmehak: These are not the payments please.

No money is paid before she is found eligible and she receives an acceptance letter please.
22/11/23, 7:06 pm - +260 96 4841330: A lot of money Is spent indeed
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/11/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: You see, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 7:10 pm - +260 96 4841330: Meaning you only pay for your the application form,write a statement of purpose and a letter of recommendation after being accepted?
22/11/23, 7:10 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please.
22/11/23, 7:11 pm - +260 96 7889730: We can then proceed on that order
22/11/23, 7:11 pm - +260 96 4841330: This is encouraging
22/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
22/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
22/11/23, 7:11 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 7:15 pm - +260 96 4841330: Wow this is amazing
22/11/23, 7:17 pm - +260 96 4841330: Okey this is great
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to have you acknowledge the same!
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/11/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/11/23, 7:26 pm - +260 96 4841330: recieved and well understood thanks
22/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Its good to have you thoroughly following please.
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

30/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: While I do understand that the deadline is of 4th December the key benefit your child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of November 2023. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.

01/12/23, 12:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Duly noted did you share the same with Ms.Betty?
01/12/23, 12:46 pm - +260 96 7889730: No we didn’t share you can share it
01/12/23, 12:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
01/12/23, 12:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you not pay the transfer charges as mentioned on the acceptance letter ?
01/12/23, 1:33 pm - +260 96 7889730: Kindly note that the acceptance letter has $350.00 that’s what has been paid and transferred no other additional charges
01/12/23, 1:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please check last page of the acceptance letter the transfer fees is mentioned
01/12/23, 1:42 pm - +260 96 7889730: Should I instruct the bank to conceal since haven’t paid the transfer charges
01/12/23, 2:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge. 

The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.

The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $368 ($350 + $18 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-
