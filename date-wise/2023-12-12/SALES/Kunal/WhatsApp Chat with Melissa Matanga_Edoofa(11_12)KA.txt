*"Education is the foundation upon which we build our future." - Christine Gregoire*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
11/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 600 9026: Good afternoon.  Yes we may
11/12/23, 12:43 pm - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
11/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 600 9026: I am fine thank you. How are you?
11/12/23, 12:50 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 12:54 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
11/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 71 600 9026: They are not available now. Am sure they will catch up with the conversation later.
11/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
11/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 600 9026: Okay.

11/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 600 9026: My name is Melissa Matanga. I am a girl aged eighteen.  I am currently waiting for my Advanced level results.  I was doing Maths, Biology and Geography.  During my spare time i enjoy reading novels and i like watching cartoons.  Am the first child in a family of three girls. I lost my biological mother last year in March.  My father is currently unemployed at the moment.  My siblings are still at school.  The second one is 10 years and was doing grade 5 this year. The last one is 4 years and not yet going to school.  My maternal uncles have been supporting my education ever since i lost my mother since she was the bread winner. And am sure my uncles will be supporting my higher education.  At my previous school i paid $120. I would like to be a medical doctor.  Ever since i was a child i have always wanted to be a medical doctor but my determination for medicine grew stronger when my mom was ill. My only wish was to treat her someday and she could get better but unfortunately i couldn't so i want to pursue medicine so that i can help treat people who are suffering the same way i have always wanted to treat my mother.
11/12/23, 4:41 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing about yourself and your family honestly, Melissa
