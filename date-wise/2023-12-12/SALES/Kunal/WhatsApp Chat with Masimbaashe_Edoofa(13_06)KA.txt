Scientists have taken technology to a whole new level by bringing Harry Potter’s invisibility cloak to life.

Chinese professor Chu Junhao, director of the Faculty of Science at Donghua University in Shanghai unveiled his invention at a virtual event called Super Night of Science, with footage later shared online.

Clips show a man accompanied by two assistants holding a life-size sheet. They demonstrate how the translucent material works by initially placing it in front of the man’s legs to show them in full view.

They then proceed to tilt it 90 degrees, and to the viewer’s surprise, the lower half of his body entirely disappears.
