10/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 978 5595: 12:30 is a bit tricky how about 18:00
11/12/23, 12:31 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon, everyone

*"Education is the foundation upon which we build our future." - Christine Gregoire*

With a positive note, I am here to resume the session
Shall we proceed?
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Yes
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - Kunal: It is a pleasure to connect with you
How are you?
11/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Well thanks.
How are you?
11/12/23, 3:59 pm - Kunal: I am doing fine, thank you
11/12/23, 3:59 pm - Kunal: Before we begin the session, shall we add your father to the group?
11/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 978 5595: No it's fine my mother is enough we can proceed
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - Kunal: May I know why cannot we add your father to the group?
11/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 78 978 5595: He has a tight schedule he won't make it for any session anyway
11/12/23, 4:14 pm - Kunal: In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
11/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 978 5595: My father wouldn't follow up. My mother is in here so she's enough.
11/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
11/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Sure
11/12/23, 4:23 pm - Kunal: I am making you the group admin, please add them
11/12/23, 4:25 pm - ~ qUnDai added +263 78 116 7947
11/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 78 978 5595: I added my sister. Are we able to proceed now?
11/12/23, 4:32 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*
11/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 78 978 5595: I've nobody else to add my mom is in here already mr Kunal!
11/12/23, 5:41 pm - Kunal: Alright Kundai
We wish you to add your father in the group to avoid any complications in the later stages
I hope you understand
11/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Ooh
11/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kunal: So, shall we add them?
11/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Add him
11/12/23, 6:13 pm - Kunal: You can add them now
11/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Okay, I've sent him the link to join it seems i can't add him myself.
11/12/23, 7:14 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 7:16 pm - +263 78 978 5595: Noted sir.
