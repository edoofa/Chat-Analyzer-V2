17/11/23, 10:10 am - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
17/11/23, 10:19 am - +265 993 64 66 69: They will join later
17/11/23, 10:32 am - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
17/11/23, 10:33 am - +265 993 64 66 69: I will add them later on or I can forward everything to them since they are not on WhatsApp

17/11/23, 11:52 am - +265 993 64 66 69: In the heart of my educational aspirations lies a profound desire to be a part of the Eduoofa community. I see in Eduoofa not just an institution but a gateway to a world of transformative learning and boundless opportunities.

Eduoofa represents more than an academic pursuit; it symbolizes a commitment to excellence, innovation, and the holistic development of individuals. As I aspire to be a part of this esteemed institution, I am not just seeking an education; I am embracing a philosophy that resonates with my own passion for growth and contribution.

This scholarship isn't merely a financial aid package; it is a partnership in my journey to shape a future where knowledge is a catalyst for positive change. With Eduoofa as my compass, I am confident that my academic endeavors will not only elevate my personal growth but also contribute meaningfully to the ethos of this institution.

I am more than an applicant; I am a future collaborator in Eduoofa's mission to empower minds and shape leaders. Together, let us embark on a journey that transcends conventional boundaries and creates a legacy of excellence.

Thank you for considering my application to be a part of the Eduoofa family.

17/11/23, 12:34 pm - +265 993 64 66 69: I am currently pursuing Bachelor's degree in Business Administration from University of malawi where my academic journey was marked by a commitment to excellence and a keen interest in strategic management.
17/11/23, 12:38 pm - +265 993 64 66 69: Currently residing in Blantyre, I find inspiration in the dynamic landscape that surrounds me. My connection to this region goes beyond geography; it influences my perspective and fuels my drive to contribute to its economic and cultural vibrancy.

Outside the realm of academia, my interests span a diverse spectrum. Whether immersed in a book, exploring nature through photography, or engaging in community service, I believe in the power of well-rounded experiences to enrich one's life. Sports, particularly tennis, serves as both a source of physical activity and a metaphor for the importance of agility and resilience in navigating challenges.

Family is the cornerstone of my support and values. I come from a close-knit family with 3 siblings, each charting their unique paths. My parents have been my pillars of guidance. My father is a driver, bringing a wealth of experience and wisdom, while mother excels in procurement  fostering a strong work ethic and dedication in me.

Beyond the realms of my professional and academic pursuits, I am deeply committed to contributing meaningfully to societal progress. Volunteering has been an enriching experience, allowing me to witness firsthand the transformative power of education and community engagement.

In essence, my journey encapsulates a tapestry of learning, growth, and a commitment to making a positive impact. I am not just an applicant; I am a narrative in progress, seeking to weave my story into the vibrant tapestry of your esteemed institution.
