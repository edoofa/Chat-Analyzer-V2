06/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 317 7426: Yes
06/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Duly received please, Munyaradzi.
06/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

06/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

06/12/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 317 7426: Well understood ma’am
06/12/23, 10:20 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
06/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 317 7426: Yes
06/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Munyaradzi, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 71 317 7426: My name is Munyaradzi Musemburi ,, i am nineteen . I just finished writing my A levels recently .I did Maths Physics and chemistry and im awaiting my results , i was learning at Mpopoma high school in Bulawayo . I wish to persue medicine if i get the opportunity to get the scholarship because I have had a passion for medicine since my childhood .i like reading novels at my spare time , i have only one older brother .My mom is a teacher and my dad is in the military . Currently i just finished writing my advanced level and im waiting for my results.
06/12/23, 10:54 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Munyaradzi, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

May I know more about your siblings please?
06/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 317 7426: I only have one older brother , he is currently at University
06/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Munyaradzi.

He is at which university please?
06/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 317 7426: At Roman Catholic University

06/12/23, 11:19 am - Harmehak: Well Munyaradzi, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
06/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 317 7426: Ok
06/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 317 7426: Education abroad can definitely be a life-changing experience .For one thing, it can open up your world view and expose you to new cultures, languages, and ways of thinking. It can also help you develop a greater sense of independence and self-confidence, as you navigate a new environment and learn to make your way in a different country.
06/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: That's well put across, Munyaradzi.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
06/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 71 317 7426: Yes i am
06/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: That's great,

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 317 7426: Yes they supporting me ma’am
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great
06/12/23, 12:29 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 317 7426: Ok ma’am noted
06/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Medicine ?
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 317 7426: Olk they are coming
06/12/23, 2:22 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/12/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 317 7426: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:25 pm - Harmehak: Received !

I await the response to remaining part, Munyaradzi.
06/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 9:06 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
07/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 317 7426: Yes lets start
07/12/23, 9:22 am - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine, Munyaradzi?
07/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 317 7426: I'm motivated to study medicine because I want to make a difference in people's lives. I know that a career in medicine will be challenging, but I also know that it will be incredibly rewarding. I'm inspired by the idea of helping people to heal and improve their health. I want to use my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the world, and I believe that studying medicine is the best way to do that.
07/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: I understand and appreciate your thoughts, Munyaradzi.

So did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine?
07/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 71 317 7426: Yes
07/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: Alright, so may I know why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?

Considering medicine and biology is completely connected with the human body and living beings.
07/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 71 317 7426: This side chemistry is the one  that is used for selection in medicine schools so i chose physics
07/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: While I understand,

However usually students opt for Biology itself.
07/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
07/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 317 7426: Ok
07/12/23, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are :

*1. Bachelor in Pharmacy*
*2. Bachelor in Optometry*
*3. Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*
*4. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
*5. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics* <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 317 7426: So they don’t get to do medicine and surgery
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: No please, Biology is a strict and mandatory requirement.
07/12/23, 6:02 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.
