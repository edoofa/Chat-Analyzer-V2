11/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: That's great Tadiwa!

It's a pleasure to know about them

I can see your parents lead a family that values education.
11/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess they really try to get us educated by all means
11/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 438 9968: All the boys in my family are very talented soccer players and my mother has a diploma in business administration
11/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
11/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Well Tadiwa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I believe higher education abroad is a life changing decision as it will give you an opportunity to interact and share ideas with international students. There is nothing more beneficial than being exposed to interaction with people from different countries. I believe my career path requires that. Higher education abroad also helps us to bring back ideas to home countries which allows global connection to make the world one place.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across, Tadiwa.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am mentally prepared Ms Harmehak. The passion of wanting to study without financially burdening my parents has  helped me to prepare.
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
11/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yes my family members are aware and they are delighted to support me mentally but financially to  a lesser extent.
11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding financial aspect, Tadiwa?
11/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: The total amount of money that my parents earn is not enough to support all the 5 children in our family. My parents encounter a lot of expenses such as school fees, food as well as clothes and other rentals so it becomes difficult for them to support the five of us.
11/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tadiwa 

So how are you planning your higher education in India?
11/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: My mother is saving from her salary every month
11/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: And I am hoping to get a scholarship
11/12/23, 6:59 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
11/12/23, 7:00 pm - Harmehak: Alright, may I know your understanding of a scholarship, Tadiwa?
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am sorry for the late response Ms Harmehak.
A scholarship is a fund given to a person inorder to support or subsidize their education or opportunity. Scholarships come in different percentages which determine the limitations of the payments done by the person offering the scholarship.
