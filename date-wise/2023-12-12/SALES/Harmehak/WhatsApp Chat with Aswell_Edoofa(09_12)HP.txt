11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Aswell, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
11/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 691 7416: I shared with them.
11/12/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 691 7416: They are aware of my plans
11/12/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Are they willing to support you financially and mentally too?
11/12/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad they are supportive
11/12/23, 5:24 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 691 7416: Yes im confident
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: I am glad!
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Actuary ?
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
11/12/23, 8:42 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile do go through the shared video to learn more about the experience of our Proud Edoofians.
