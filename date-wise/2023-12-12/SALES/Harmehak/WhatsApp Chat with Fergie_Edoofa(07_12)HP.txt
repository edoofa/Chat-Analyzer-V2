From Mr Mudenda I've learnt many things. Such as  self dependent and He also guided me in choosing career.
07/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: That's great, I am glad you had a thorough discussion.

Did you happen to read the document shared with you earlier?
07/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yah I did, but not the whole of it.
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: I understand.
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
07/12/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 738 6311: thank you
07/12/23, 11:00 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yes , it is.
07/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Fergie, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Tafara 1 high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
07/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I am the firstborn child in a family of six children. I was raised in Tafara. For my primary education, I attended Mwanandishe Primary then Tafara 1 High School. Being the eldest child in my family I had an early sense of commitment that was to look after my siblings. My mother works as a teacher at Mwanandishe Primary School. Life has never been easy for my family in terms of finances especially when the school feels hiked to $180 from $90. After my father died in 2019 I was forced to learn in debt. Mashambanzou Care Trust chartered for my fees until I finished my ordinary level which I passed with flying colors.

Driven by an impoverished way of life, I had to carefully make financial calculations hence I discovered my passion for arithmetics. At the advanced level, I took science subjects that is mathematics, chemistry, and biology. Given the opportunity to attain academic studies, I want to be a veterinary scientist. I believe this scholarship will be a stepping stone for me to achieve my dream and bring honor to my family and community as well as transform their standard of living.
07/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: I am very sorry for your loss, Fergie.
07/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you Ms. Harrmehak.
07/12/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Fergie, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
07/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Thank you.
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Well Fergie now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 738 6311: I think studying abroad will not offer me education and professional skills only, but life skills also. This will help me when it comes to social interactions with others social groups and it'll also be easier to access job opportunities .
07/12/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Okay, thank you Ms. Harmehak
08/12/23, 9:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/12/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 738 6311: Yes we can start.
08/12/23, 9:18 am - Harmehak: Very well,

And would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
08/12/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
08/12/23, 12:56 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Okay Ms. Harmehak. I'm having connection problem this, I'm sorry .
09/12/23, 9:30 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/12/23, 9:46 am - +263 77 261 0463: Good morning. Yes we can continue. Thank you
09/12/23, 9:56 am - Harmehak: I am currently communicating with Fergie or Mrs Kudzanai please?
09/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 261 0463: I am Mrs Kudzanai. Fergie is currently struggling with network connectivity. He is trying to get a better place to improve his connectivity
09/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

I understand.

Have you been following the discussion so far?
09/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 261 0463: Yes I have been following
09/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Wonderful, so far do you have any queries?
09/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 77 261 0463: No queries at all so far.
09/12/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

Mrs Kudzanai, were you able to discuss more regarding the finances from Fergie?

Since he happened to read the shared document at the earlier stages.
09/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 261 0463: Yes I did,  I was telling him that my prayer is he gets a bigger percentage of the scholarship. This will help ease the financial burden on me.
09/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: I completely understand please,

Mrs Kudzanai, considering the finances involved, what is your take on the same?

If he is found eligible, are you willing to support him financially and mentally?
09/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 261 0463: I will try my best to offer financial assistance as well as supporting him mentally.
09/12/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I am glad you are supportive, Mrs Kudzanai!

Meanwhile as we proceed ahead, may I know more about Fergie's siblings?
09/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 261 0463: Fergie is the first son in a family of 6 children. The second child is girl aged 18,  she will be doing her Advanced level studies next year. The next one is a girl aged 14 who is doing Form 3. There is a boy aged 10 who is in grade 5. There is a set of twin boys aged 8. They are in grade 3
09/12/23, 11:35 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please,

It's a pleasure to know more about them, Mrs Kudzanai,

So who supports them all for the education financially please?
09/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am a primary school teacher, I don't earn much. The kids in primary school do not pay fees as they learn at the school I teach. The arrangement there is that our children as teachers do not pay fees. Secondary children I am paying for one child. The girl doing advanced level is having her fees paid for by a well wisher from our community.
09/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Fergie like he mentioned earlier had his fees paid for by an organization called Mashambanzou Care Trust
09/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, I do understand.

However I would like to add and appreciate your efforts to support your children.
09/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Thank you
09/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: So far, do you understand the following too?
09/12/23, 12:12 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if he is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, he would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
09/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I do understand this very well. Like I alluded to earlier, I will try my best to assist him financially. Knowing him as I do, the Earn while you learn program will not pause any challenges to him. He is able to multi task and make sure he completes everything and that too in time. Growing up with a lot of responsibilities made him a hard worker
09/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Mrs Kudzanai.

However would you agree that he would require financial support from you as well?
09/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I do understand that
09/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: So are you willing to support him roughly $1000 a year?
09/12/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Yes, I will do
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
09/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
09/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am very confident that he will get the grades. Even the pre covid requirements, he will get them
09/12/23, 1:04 pm - Harmehak: It's great to know the same.

May I please have his O level results?
09/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am not at home presently. If you can allow me to send you the results by end of day today when I will be home
09/12/23, 1:08 pm - Harmehak: That's surely alright please.

You can type them if you recall.
09/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 261 0463: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please,

Can you please share his current subject combination along with what exactly he would like to study?
09/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 261 0463: He was doing
Mathematics
Chemistry
Biology
09/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: He appeared his A level exams this year please? <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Pharmacy or Veterinary Science are his passion
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Yes
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: And results will be out next year February
09/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Or late January
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please.

So since he wishes to study Pharmacy or Veterinary Sciences,

May I know why he didn't he pursue Physics in his A level?

I believe it's a crucial science subject, isn't it?
09/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 261 0463: It  could be a result of poor career guidance, our research had shown that chemistry and biology are the key subjects.  Also since he had a grade C in Physics he could not pursue it at A level due to school policy that does not allow a learner to pursue a subject with a C
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
09/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
09/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 261 0463: From the above courses, we sat down and agreed that it would be best if he studies physiotherapy
09/12/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Sorry for getting back to you late. I was waiting to reach home and discuss the issue with Fergie
11/12/23, 9:07 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
11/12/23, 9:11 am - +263 77 261 0463: Yes we can start. Good morning
11/12/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: I understand please.
11/12/23, 9:24 am - Harmehak: Sure Mrs Kudzanai.
11/12/23, 9:26 am - Harmehak: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.

Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.

Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.

The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
11/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 261 0463: Thank you for the information. It only shows we did not err in choosing Physiotherapy as a career for Fergie
11/12/23, 9:34 am - Harmehak: That's great,

However what intrigued him towards Physiotherapy more?

As usually I have seen more students opt for Medical Laboratory Technology as well.

What are your thoughts on the same please?
11/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 261 0463: We used to stay with my mother who was paralyzed due to strokes. She lived in that state for more than 10 years. This is what pushed him to take physiotherapy. Also looking at our country Zimbabwe presently we decided to take Physiotherapy because there are a lot of employment opportunities for the course
11/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: I am sorry to hear about the same please.
11/12/23, 9:54 am - Harmehak: It's good to see that he has a kind heart that wishes to do well only.
11/12/23, 10:15 am - Harmehak: Mrs Kudzanai, Now as we proceed ahead with the remaining discussion, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
11/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 261 0463: I am not sure if I got you right but from what I hear Indian tertiary education is among the best internationally
11/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
11/12/23, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

11/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 261 0463: Quite intriguing facts there. It makes me more determined to have my son study in India
11/12/23, 11:48 am - +263 77 261 0463: Thank you for the information. I learnt a lot
11/12/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Mrs Fergie.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 261 0463: I got the information on the average cost of study from this message you shared with us
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: That's great.
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 11:50 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 261 0463: Duly noted. Thank you
11/12/23, 12:01 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Kudzanai, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/12/23, 12:06 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I do agree with you
11/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Kudzanai?
11/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I have a great appreciation of how Edoofa is making higher education accessible and affordable
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

11/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed the discussion so far, Mrs Kudzanai and Fergie?
11/12/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 738 6311: Yes, I'm following.
11/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am sincerely sorry Mrs Harmehak, I was hosting visitors. I couldn't follow for a while. 
Let me say I got time to go through the EWYL program. It is a good program that I am sure will help us in reducing our contribution towards Fergie's fees
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 261 0463: And it will open avenues for him in research and all other mentioned projects
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

I appreciate your acknowledgement for the Earn While You Learn Program.
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
11/12/23, 2:47 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Noted. I am following
11/12/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

11/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Quite a helpful and interesting program, the EWYL
11/12/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I hope my son will one day benefit from it
11/12/23, 3:28 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
11/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I am ready
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Kudzanai, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
11/12/23, 3:56 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 261 0463: A student will end up spending $1500-$2250 applying to 5 universities
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 4:06 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Kudzanai, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
11/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I think so too.
11/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Does this mean we have to pay the $350 by December 30
11/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 261 0463: It is a positive development on our part since it makes it very affordable to us who are low income earners
11/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
11/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
11/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Noted. Thank you. In our case when do we expect the reservation letter
11/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 261 0463: It would be good to settle for this arrangement considering our financial status
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
11/12/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/12/23, 4:50 pm - +263 77 261 0463: I now understand properly. Thank you
11/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
11/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

11/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Noted
11/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
11/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
11/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

11/12/23, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: Feel free to connect with her over a normal call, Mrs Kudzanai.
11/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Beautiful. Inspiring
11/12/23, 5:05 pm - +263 77 261 0463: Okay. I definitely will call her
11/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
11/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: I am glad please
11/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
11/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/12/23, 5:53 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
