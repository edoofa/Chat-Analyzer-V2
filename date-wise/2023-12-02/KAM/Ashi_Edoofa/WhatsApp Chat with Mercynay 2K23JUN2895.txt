10/08/23, 8:25 am - +263 71 237 7790: Good morning Mr Singh
10/08/23, 8:26 am - +263 71 237 7790: Wanted to confirm if the percentage is still 7% if I pay through Mr Rajan Nayer
10/08/23, 8:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Mercynay!
I hope you are doing well today.
10/08/23, 8:27 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, it would remain the same as 7% if you are making the payment in cash.
10/08/23, 8:28 am - +263 71 237 7790: Alright there is some confusion here then because he was saying its 11%
10/08/23, 8:34 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, he is right. For the payment that you are planning to make, the charges would differ based on the type of payment. Let me help you with that here. 

For the balance in the registration fee: Transfer Charges would be 7% of the amount.

For the Tuition Fee: Tranfer Charges would be 11% of the amount. 

So, in this case, I would advise you to make two different payments one for the balance registration and the other for the balance tuition fee. I hope you are clear with that?
10/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 237 7790: Its alright thank you

17/08/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 237 7790: Yes
17/08/23, 11:03 am - +263 71 237 7790: Morning how are you
17/08/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
17/08/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 237 7790: Per semester fee aftrr the scholarship is 1475
2. Standard duration of my course is 2Years (8 semesters)
3.Admission processing fee is 200
4.Registration fee is 700
17/08/23, 11:10 am - Milan Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 2-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 4 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $1475 making your per annum tuition fee ($1475*2) = $2950. Is that clear?
17/08/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 237 7790: Yes it is
17/08/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. To provide you with a better understanding of the offer letter, I would like to assist you in breaking down the fee structure of Lovely Professional University.
17/08/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: *On-Campus Accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1475*2 = $2950
2. Per Annum Accommodation plus food Cost = $1675
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4825.
17/08/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: *Off-Campus accommodation*

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee = $1475*2 = $2950
2. Per Annum Accommodation Cost = $1000 or less
3. Per Annum Examination Fee = $150
3. Per Annum Health Insurance = $50

The total cost of education with off-campus accommodation = $4150.
17/08/23, 11:18 am - Milan Edoofa: Compared to the on-campus accommodation, if you prefer more affordable housing and don't want to stay on campus, you can choose off-campus accommodation. The approximate annual cost for off-campus accommodation, including food expenses, is around $1000, you will also have the option to cook your own meals.

To find off-campus accommodation options, you can connect with Edoofians who are already staying off-campus. They will assist you in finding suitable accommodation. If you don't know any Edoofians, we will help you connect with them closer to your arrival date so that they can guide you.

It's important to note that LPU doesn't force anyone to choose the hostel. They encourage students to visit the campus, see the options available, and then decide whether they want to stay on campus or off campus.
17/08/23, 11:28 am - +263 71 237 7790: Ok noted
17/08/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 237 7790: With the time left umm i think iam not able to take the LPU offer letter
17/08/23, 12:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here Mercynay, why is it that you think that the time is not enough to take the LPU letter dear?
17/08/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 237 7790: I see it as too expensive for us to be able to pay $4150 per annum , According to my father he was saying he will not be able to raise the money so he came to a conclusion that at least for Galgotias he can manage a bit
17/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 370 5882: Long time Mr Milan Singh the fees are higher than Galgotias although if funds permit we can but this time we can't
17/08/23, 1:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: So, shall we go-ahead and finalize that you will be going to Galgotias University for your higher education?
17/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 237 7790: Yes Mr Singh
17/08/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please dear, let me pass on the same information to the university officials and get your admission confirmed for Galgotias University.

Please review them carefully as you will need them for your visa application process. Once you have gone through the letters, kindly send us an acknowledgment to this group so that we can guide you with the visa application form.

31/08/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 237 7790: I don't understand where they are saying fees to be paid is 1050.. Wasn't it supposed to be waived off because i paid 750 for registration fee plus 250 as the remaining tuition fee since we had agreed that 750 is to be part of the tuition
31/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 237 7790: I also request for the receipt of paid fees
31/08/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, Mercynay, that is absolutely correct, I want you to take a look at your acceptance letter again. I think it's important to double-check everything. As per the letter, the balance tuition fee is actually after the adjustment of $750 in your first-year tuition fee of $1800. 

If you subtract $750 from $1800, then the balance for the first year should be $1050. Additionally, the $250 that you paid to clear your fee will be adjusted to your first-year fee once you arrive in India and report to the campus. For your reference, I am sharing the payment receipt for your registration fee and the tuition fee payment below.

31/08/23, 5:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mercynay, as per the visa you shared, it seems as if you collected your visa on the 22nd of August, however, you did not share any such information with us, is that right?
31/08/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 237 7790: Yes u had told me to process the the online so proceeded with the physical
31/08/23, 6:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I would like to inquire about something, Mercynay. Why didn't you inform us about the update? You seemed to only focus on obtaining your bonafide letter over the last couple of days, which was a requirement for your visa application process. 

I must admit I am a little taken aback because in our previous conversation, you seemed to put undue pressure on obtaining the bonafide letter. However, it appears that you had already secured your visa without submitting the letter, and that too a week ago. If you had informed us earlier about obtaining your visa, we could have moved forward in our discussions, but now we have been working towards a goal that is no longer needed.

Please don't take this the wrong way, Mercynay, but it raises concerns about transparency, especially since we are going to be your guardians in India.
31/08/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 237 7790: Ohhh ok am sorry about that
31/08/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 237 7790: But then my parents still wanted to see the bonafide letter and the receipt because they were also doubting about the transparency of the same
31/08/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 237 7790: That's why i was so pressurized in enquiring about the same
31/08/23, 6:24 pm - +263 71 237 7790: Sorry for the inconvenience but you wouldn't understand the pressure I was getting from parents
31/08/23, 6:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mercynay, if this was the case, it would have been better if you had been more forthcoming about the situation. The university was verifying your credentials, which is why it took some time. Despite you completing all the necessary admission procedures and securing your admission acceptance, you still seem to believe that we have not been transparent with you and do not have your best interests at heart. I am not sure what you expect us to interpret from this.
31/08/23, 6:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Whatever has been done is irreversible, and we must accept that fact. However, I must express my disappointment with the way you handled the situation. Your actions reflect on the team under your supervision, and I hope you will take steps to improve your behavior and ensure that such incidents do not happen again.

I am thrilled to hear about your visa update. Congratulations on this remarkable achievement! We are excited for you and looking forward to your arrival. To ensure a collective experience with your fellow students, please book your flight tickets with an arrival date of September 6th.

Congratulations on reaching this significant milestone, and we are eagerly looking forward to seeing you soon! ✈️🌍

31/08/23, 6:33 pm - +263 71 237 7790: Iam so sorry
31/08/23, 6:34 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mercynay, we do not question the situation you are in, however, we are concerned with the way you handled it. As I mentioned above, we cannot change whatever happened, hence, let us focus on the next steps you are to undertake.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 4:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

03/09/23, 4:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
