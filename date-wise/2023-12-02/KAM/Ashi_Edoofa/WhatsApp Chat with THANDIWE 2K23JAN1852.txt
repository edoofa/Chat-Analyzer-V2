02/08/23, 1:42 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thandiwe,

I hope this message finds you in high spirits, and I trust that everything is going smoothly with your visa application process. I wanted to inquire if you have managed to complete the visa application form by now, or if you require any assistance with it?

If there's anything I can do to help or if you have any questions about the application, please don't hesitate to ask. We are here to support you throughout the process and ensure a successful application at the embassy.
02/08/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Everything is going smoothly for now Sir
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: That is amazing. Can you please share your response to the query I asked regarding your visa application so that I can understand the status of your application process and guide you on the right track?
02/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I will as soon as Im in good space
02/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I have not yet completed the online visa application  because my academic certificates are not yet attested but I have partially filled the other parts of the online application form
02/08/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Tomorrow I have an appointment at the Ministry of foreign affairs for the attestation process then I will complete my online visa application afterwards
02/08/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand, @263779568110, and I appreciate you sharing this information with me. I would like to provide you with a recent update that could be beneficial for your visa application. For some students, the embassy has begun issuing visas without the requirement of attested documents. Therefore, if you wish, you can try processing your visa application without getting the documents attested.
02/08/23, 8:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: By opting for this approach, you may save time in the application process, secure your visa earlier, and avoid the additional cost of getting the documents attested. However, please keep in mind that individual circumstances may vary, and if the embassy asks for the attested documents, in that case, you would have to get them attested and then proceed further. I hope you have taken note of this update?
02/08/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I didnt know. Thank you for sharing such  useful information.
02/08/23, 8:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: You are most welcome Thandiwe. Take your time for the remaining requirements. Once you are done with the visa application form, kindly share the form with me here so I can crosscheck all the details and ensure everything is accurate. This will help us move forward with the next steps in the process smoothly.
02/08/23, 8:56 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If you encounter any issues or have any questions during the form submission, feel free to reach out, and we will be here to assist you. We look forward to receiving the downloaded form.

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: THANDIWE 2K23JAN1852*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 3:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.
