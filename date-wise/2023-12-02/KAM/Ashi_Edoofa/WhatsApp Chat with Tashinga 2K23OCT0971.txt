23/10/23, 8:36 am - +263 77 535 2647: Thank you. Can I please delay the process by at least 20 minutes. I got tied up a bit at work
23/10/23, 8:38 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263775352647, Let's connect after 20 minutes I am looking forward for your response.
23/10/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 535 2647: Please lets go ahead
23/10/23, 8:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263775352647. Let me add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights: <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 8:50 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/10/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/10/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/10/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/10/23, 8:51 am - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?

23/10/23, 1:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263775352647. If you want to discuss more regarding the videos, do let me know. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/10/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 09:00 AM.
23/10/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded.

23/10/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please do let me know once you have taken a note of the above messages <This message was edited>
23/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Recieved and noted

23/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Copied let us deliberate and inform you sir
23/10/23, 2:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263775352647, I am looking forward for your response.
23/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 535 2647: For planning reason, I understand we will be required to  pay $500-750 university registration  fee, usually when is it paid? (Time frame)
23/10/23, 3:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263775352647 Firstly, I would like to appreciate your proactive steps regarding your University registration fees. It's truly commendable.  However, I'd like to kindly inform you that there's no need to make any payments until you've received your official offer letter and have confirmed your choice of university. Please rest assured that we will provide you with all the necessary information and guidance at the appropriate moment.
23/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Thank you.
23/10/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263775352647. Moving forward with the session, May I know by when you will be able to complete the above form and documents.
23/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 520 3440: Can I send tomorrow morning
23/10/23, 3:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Surely @263785203440. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
25/10/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 535 2647: If all goes well today sir
25/10/23, 10:24 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263775352647. As you must be aware that your EWYL session was scheduled for yesterday but due to some initial delays in our session, we were unable to provide you with the necessary support to commence your EWYL journey.

As a result, we have rescheduled your EWYL session for the 27th of October, which falls on a Friday. To ensure a smooth start to your EWYL journey on that date, we kindly request that you share the revised EWYL form with us. I hope this message is clear to you. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.
25/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 535 2647: Noted. I already have Tashinga's statement of entry (A level)

25/10/23, 10:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the assurance, looking forward for the document.
25/10/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 535 2647: Welcome
25/10/23, 10:43 am - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, Let's start our today's session. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelors in Computer Application* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
25/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 520 3440: This message was deleted
25/10/23, 11:15 am - Ashi Edoofa: Kindly excuse me @263785203440 Could you please explain your message?
25/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 535 2647: Disregard  lost message please

25/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 520 3440: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 520 3440: Please find answer to question 1
25/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 535 2647: It is accurate yes
25/10/23, 12:31 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In order to have the effective communication, I would like to know if we can proceed further with the session. Also, I wanted to take a follow up on the EWYL document.
25/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 535 2647: We can proceed sir
25/10/23, 12:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the go ahead @263775352647. Although, I wanted to inform you that in order to start the EWYL journey on Friday the EWYL Document must be shared today.
25/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Ok noted. Rachel confirmed she is sending soon.
25/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 520 3440: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you @263785203440 for sharing the document, I have update our records with the same.
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
25/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Noted
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
25/10/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
25/10/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Correct we discussed
25/10/23, 1:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
25/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 535 2647: We are yes please
25/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
25/10/23, 1:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
25/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Noted
25/10/23, 1:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
25/10/23, 1:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
25/10/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Understood
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
25/10/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
25/10/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/10/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/10/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Ok noted
25/10/23, 3:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Noted. What's is the advantage for a student who attains for example 12 to 15 points at A level
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263775352647. These benefits are for those students who failed to attain atleast two A level Passes.
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
25/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Understood that. I am just asking for general information
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I can understand that @263775352647, for those students we have benefits that we have discussed above.
25/10/23, 4:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have gone through my last message?
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Yes I have read it
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
25/10/23, 4:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
25/10/23, 4:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
25/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Very clear
25/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 535 2647: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 535 2647: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 4:59 pm - +263 77 535 2647: I don't have the PDF converter if it's a problem Rachel will send in proper format later because she tied up at work
25/10/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the documents with us @263775352647, We have updated them in our records. Now, Moving ahead with our session.
25/10/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 6:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
25/10/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Duly noted
25/10/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
25/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
25/10/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
25/10/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 535 2647: I don't have any queries for now.registration  cost will be $  750 reduced to 600 courtesy of$  150 help from Edoofa endowment benefitm. That $750 will be deducted from the total university fee per year. $600 can be spread in such a way that a student can 300$ first then pay the remainder after 30 days.
25/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263775352647. Your registration fees is reduced to $600 as edoofa will pay the extra $150 according to the Endowment Plan and $750 will deducted from your university fee for only first year.
25/10/23, 7:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 8:48 am - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 267 2924: Good morning
18/11/23, 10:05 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning @263772672924, I hope you have gone through the offer letter by now, could you please share your response with us?
18/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 535 2647: Good morning. Definitely we are happy with the conditional offer letter. I think let's go through it. I have got some points I need clarification
18/11/23, 11:09 am - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263775352647.  As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.

The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 535 2647: Ok thank you my main worry is about the the due date for the payment of 750 registration fee. 15 it's needed in 15 days time. Like I mentioned in our previous chats about the same. You assured that the money can be spread into two installments. Does that still apply now.
18/11/23, 11:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, you are absolutely right we will talk about the same in detail in our session today. Before that now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Gulzar Group of Institutions, rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 11:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 535 2647: 1)  Tuition fee after the 60% scholarship $1200;  2) Compulsory  hostel fee $1200.        $750 registration fee will be deducted from the $2400
18/11/23, 12:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly, you are absolutely correct. I would like to provide some additional details regarding your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes. As you can see, following the scholarship, your annual tuition fee amounts to $1200.

In the first year, it is compulsory for students to select on-campus hostel accommodation, primarily because the university needs to complete their Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) formalities. However, from the second year onwards, students have the flexibility to choose off-campus housing if they prefer, as they would have become more familiar with the area and likely formed connections with their classmates.
18/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Ok noted.
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Gulzar Group of Institutes places a strong emphasis on student safety as a top priority. To ensure that students have an affordable and comfortable living experience in the hostels, the university has designed its accommodations with the well-being of the students in mind costing $1200. 

The hostel rooms are four-seaters and come equipped with air conditioning. Importantly, the cost of accommodation also covers the expenses for the food/mess service, which includes three meals a day (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) for each student.
18/11/23, 12:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, the university intentionally assigns roommates to students to foster a supportive and communal atmosphere, enabling students to rely on their peers for assistance and companionship. 

This approach enhances the overall living experience and contributes to a sense of security and camaraderie within the student community. I hope you have taken note of this and this clarifies the tuition fee and the accommodation facilities for you?
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Thank you
18/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Where is the universitas located on India. Which town?
18/11/23, 2:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, @263775352647 I'll share the university insight with you soon. Before that let us move forward with our discussion. As you are now familiar with your annual fee at Gulzar Group of Institutes, let me outline the various facilities and services covered by the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living/Accommodation Costs
3. Food Costs
4. Library Fee
5. 24-Hour Wifi Access
6. Maintenance Fee
7. Water Bill
8. Electricity Bill
18/11/23, 2:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: These components collectively make up the comprehensive package that [Name] will receive as part of his university fee, ensuring a well-rounded and hassle-free educational experience. I hope we are together so far and this resonates with you?
18/11/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Noted
18/11/23, 3:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we have established the your tuition fee at $1200 and accommodation fee at $1200, making your total annual education cost $2400, let me guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. Through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
18/11/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Very much clear
18/11/23, 4:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earn scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2400. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2400 - $1000 = $1400, which will need to be paid by you. <This message was edited>
18/11/23, 4:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Clarified yes
18/11/23, 4:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.

Having said that, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee mentioned in your offer letter.
18/11/23, 4:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As previously mentioned, the registration fee of $750 is not an additional cost; instead, it's a part of your first-year tuition fee. Therefore, it will be adjusted against the total fee of $2400 for the first year. 

Consequently, the remaining fee that you will be required to pay after you arrives in India will be $2400- $750 = $1650. This amount can be conveniently paid in two installments of $825 and $825, with a six-month gap between them.
18/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The first installment can be paid either before your arrival in India or within three days of his arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this information is clear and we both have a shared understanding of this arrangement?
18/11/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 535 2647: It is clear sure
18/11/23, 4:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 1st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 535 2647: We are together yes. I just hope I will manage to secure the money though the due date is too close
18/11/23, 5:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We understand that @263775352647, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Afirmative. We have come far that  I am forgetting some of the information.
18/11/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263775352647, Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 1st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 1st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 6:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before *December 1st, 2023* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Thank you we really in agreement
20/11/23, 6:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tashinga, I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our discussion, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to engage with us to move ahead with our discussion?
20/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 833 8947: Good evening
We're doing quite well
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are doing well @263788338947, Are you ready for the session please?
20/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 833 8947: Yes ,I'm ready
20/11/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation, As you remember in our last session, we shared the payment plan, now let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 6:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 833 8947: We stay in chiredzi
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 6:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 833 8947: Noted
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Good evening thank you for the information. There was a srios network blackout this side since morning. However I try to sort out payment to Mr Kawadza again tomorrow.
20/11/23, 8:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263775352647, We can understand that there was blackout however may I please know if you have taken a note of my above messages?
20/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Affirmative yes. However does Mr Rajan only accept cash payment or transfer
20/11/23, 8:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me inform you that the payment can be made either in cash or through Mukuru. Please note that in both cases, there will be a transfer charge of 7% of the amount you wish to send. Let me share the mukuru details with you. 

*Mukuru Details*

Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?

20/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Not at the moment. Any issues I will definitely put them forward. Thank you

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

25/11/23, 12:18 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern with us, I can understand that you are looking for the cheaper accommodation in the second year for Tashinga and I'm pleased to provide you with further clarification. Certainly, upon Tashinga's arrival in India, there is the flexibility to explore off-campus housing options. However, it's important to note that the estimated cost of off-campus living, inclusive of food expenses, is anticipated to range between $800 and $1000. I hope you understand?

However, I am glad to see that you are dedicated towards your Higher Education and I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
25/11/23, 1:26 pm - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.

Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.

As the university has set a deadline of December 1st, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?

25/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?

https://www.paypal.com/signin?returnUri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fmyaccount%2Fmoney&state=%2F
01/12/23, 11:44 am - Ashi Edoofa: With this approach, You will be able to made a transaction easily. If you have any concern please do let me know.
01/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 78 520 3440: This is the same link
01/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 78 520 3440: And it's taking me to that 300usd invoice once I open it
01/12/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know please. To help you here, could you please let me know the status of your verification?

Have you been able to log in to your account, and add your card details, and verify the same with PayPal? If not, may I know what is the challenge you are facing in getting the same done?
01/12/23, 12:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, if you find that the challenges with Paypal persist and you're unable to verify your account, you can opt to make the payment through your Visa/Mastercard by visiting the Edoofa website. I am providing you with the link to the website [https://www.edoofa.com/]. 

To proceed, simply visit the website and scroll to the bottom of the page, where you'll find the "Pay Now" button. Clicking on this button will ask you to fill in your card details and proceed with the payment. I have also attached screenshots for your reference.

01/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 520 3440: I'm not finding a pay now option on the portal
01/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 78 520 3440: I have verified but I saw that for PayPal to lift the 250 max payout you pay an amount(which I did) and I got notified that it would be lifted after 3 days that's why I was asking you guys to split the invoice
01/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for updating me, Tashinga. I am glad to hear that your account verification is in progress, and now you are waiting for an update from their end.

While we wait for your account verification, as per your request, I can assist you with the two invoices. However, I want to make you aware that this might not fully resolve the issue, as you currently have a transaction limit of $250. If you manage to make the payment for the first invoice, you may encounter the same challenge with the second part, as PayPal has not lifted the limit.
01/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To address this, we can create two invoices, each for $150. If you can process both of them, it will complete the formalities for the first part. However, if you can only process the first payment of $150 and face difficulties with the remaining, we can hold off on the second payment. Once your account is fully verified, you can then proceed with the second part of the fee. What are your thoughts on this?
01/12/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 520 3440: That's still okay because the money is in the visa account
01/12/23, 2:39 pm - +263 78 520 3440: Let's do 250 then we cross the bridge when we get there its easier for both of us isn't it?
01/12/23, 2:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, Let me share the invoice with you for $250

01/12/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the payment receipt for your university registration fee, we have duly noted it. Our accounts team is currently processing the same receipts for payment confirmation.

Once the payment is verified, we will update your scholarship application accordingly. Additionally, we will notify the university authorities about the payment for their records to ensure a smooth visa process.
01/12/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 535 2647: Noted thank you
01/12/23, 10:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263775352647
