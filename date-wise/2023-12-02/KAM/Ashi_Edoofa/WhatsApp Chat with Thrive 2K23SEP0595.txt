20/09/23, 1:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Thrive.

I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Im good and you
20/09/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Sorry network is bad this side
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I was going through the video understanding you shared yesterday,  and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
20/09/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
20/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted

20/09/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
20/09/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Ok
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 01.00 pm.
20/09/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

21/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 828 3290: An accounting standard is a common set of principles, standards, and procedures that define the basis of financial accounting policies and practices.

Examples of accounting standards include revenue recognition, asset classification, allowable methods for depreciation, what is considered depreciable, lease classifications, and outstanding share measurement.

It is mandatory for companies to follow accounting standards as it ensures uniformity in the accounting process and also makes statements comparable with other organisations.
21/09/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 828 3290: Accounting is the process of recording financial transactions pertaining to a business. The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators, and tax collection entities. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position, and cash flows. 

Audit is the examination or inspection of various books of accounts by an auditor followed by physical checking of inventory to make sure that all departments are following documented system of recording transactions. It is done to ascertain the accuracy of financial statements provided by the organisation.

accounting indicates maintaining a company’s financial statements. In contrast, auditing means checking whether the financial statements maintained by the company are accurate. Accounting is done for daily transactions, while auditing is done quarterly or annually.

Accounting primarily focuses on current financial transactions and activities, while auditing focuses on past financial statements.

Accounting is very detailed and captures all the details related to financial transactions, records, and account statements, whereas auditing generally uses financial statements and records on a sample basis

A company employee usually performs accounting tasks, while an external person or agency audits.

Both accounting and auditing are essential and fundamental for every organization and play a decisive role. However, the scope of auditing is broader than accounting. It requires in-depth knowledge of tax laws and regulations, accounting and auditing standards

22/09/23, 12:11 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes  i am available
22/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents while we wait for the O- level results.. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
22/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
22/09/23, 12:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course, Bachelor of Commerce, for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
22/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes true
22/09/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
22/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes im ready
22/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
22/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
22/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
22/09/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
22/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 828 3290: noted
22/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
22/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
22/09/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes it is impossible
22/09/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
22/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
22/09/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
22/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted

22/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes we are
22/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 828 3290: I have a question

Is it a must to stay at the campus
22/09/23, 12:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718283290 kindly excuse me for a while, as I am heading for a meeting please, I would have loved to attend to your query, however, I will get back to it once I am back from the meeting. I hope you understand?

25/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
25/09/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 828 3290: 👆👆
25/09/23, 9:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, let me help you understand it is not mandatory to stay on Campus, many Edoofains are staying off campus, however, please do not worry everything will be discussed in more detail.

I hope we are clear?
25/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
25/09/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
26/09/23, 6:48 am - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
26/09/23, 6:48 am - +263 71 828 3290: Good morning
26/09/23, 6:58 am - +263 71 828 3290: To those who stay off campus ,According to your estimation rent cost how much per month
26/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thrive 

Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

To commence your EWYL Program, your dedicated mentor has created a group with the name *Thrive EWYL23E0678*. You along with your parents/guardian/sponsor will have to join your group using the below link.

Group Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/LK98piKtdeQ3ygeTVRQPE1"
26/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you and your parents have joined the group. please send the following message to the group - *Dear Mentor, my name is Thrive Duncan Tinarwo and my EWYL group name is Thrive EWYL23E0678.* I have completed my counseling session with the admissions team and now I am ready to start with my EWYL journey as well.
26/09/23, 12:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms. __"
26/09/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: By the time you responded it was past our available hours, so we did not get back to you, thank you for your query, however, I would appreciate you to be a little patient Thrive, since each and every query of yours will be covered as we move ahead with the discussion,.

Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Mr./Ms.
26/09/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Ok
26/09/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, in the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us to move ahead with the discussion?
26/09/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes im available
26/09/23, 12:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you have any queries so far?
26/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 828 3290: I dont have now
26/09/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
26/09/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.

26/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Hello Admission officer, I have started my EWYL journey and my mentor is Ms Aditi
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I wish you a wonderful journey ahead with your Mentor.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
26/09/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
05/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes i am
05/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 828 3290: How are you
05/10/23, 1:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and thank you for sharing the O-level result. It is duly noted with us. May I know if you are ready to start with the discussion?
05/10/23, 1:24 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes im ready
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
05/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes we are
05/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Thank you..Noted
05/10/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted..im happy ti hear that
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
05/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
05/10/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Wow thats amazing
05/10/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Im done
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. On the basis of Blessing's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
05/10/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Thrive, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.

05/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
05/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/10/23, 1:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes and it sound good
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
05/10/23, 1:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes thats good
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
05/10/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 15, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 15, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Notes ...all these benefits are amazing
05/10/23, 2:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
05/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes provide more inoformation
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
05/10/23, 2:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
05/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Noted
05/10/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
05/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
05/10/23, 2:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
05/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
05/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 828 3290: I agree
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
05/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
05/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes
05/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Sorry about late reply i was recording an audio in EWYL group
05/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I am glad to know that you have started your EWYL journey and taking it seriously for your growth ahead.
05/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
05/10/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
05/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes Noted
05/10/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.

05/10/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand network can be a challenge, I am glad to be connected with you again. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 3:34 pm - +263 71 828 3290: I dont have any queries rightnow
05/10/23, 3:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
05/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes they are excited
05/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes im really excited
05/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
05/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Ok
05/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Good night

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you want to share any thoughts of concerns?

11/10/23, 3:59 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Send**
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263718283290 this is something I can not answer as I mentioned above the university 3-5 days to evaluate your application, and every university takes its own time as soon as we receive an update we shall update you please do not worry.
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Ok thank you
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

17/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 100% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout your course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Thats it
17/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Sorry for late reply
17/10/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Thank you so much ,i really appreciate .I'm happy
17/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Thank you so much adoofa team,God bless you. I really appreciate your authentic and much needed help.
17/10/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Thrive Duncan Tinarwo father
17/10/23, 11:00 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Sorry for late replies nowadays im writting my exams
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thrive!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome please. Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $0
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $1250 + $250 = $1500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $1250. I hope you are clear about that?
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes thank you very much
18/10/23, 4:44 pm - +263 71 828 3290: im fine how are you
18/10/23, 4:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm fine too dear, thank you for asking. Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes thank you for the information
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, students under the Edoofa Program have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
18/10/23, 4:58 pm - Milan Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits. 

In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
18/10/23, 5:07 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes thank you
18/10/23, 5:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $1250 and so the balance fee becomes $1250 - $1000 = $250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 828 3290: How much is the cost of food per month
18/10/23, 5:16 pm - +263 71 828 3290: Yes thats sound great
18/10/23, 10:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding the food, if all the students residing together will prefer self-cooking option in which they will be able to cook food as per their preference, then the costs of that would be around $35-40 per month. And if they will choose the meal plan available in the Hostel, then it will be around $70-90 per month please. I hope this is clear?
19/10/23, 5:46 am - +263 71 828 3290: Yes ,thank you very much
19/10/23, 5:47 am - +263 71 828 3290: There is no electricity this side so my phone is battery low
19/10/23, 5:48 am - +263 71 828 3290: Now tell me explain to me about registration fee
19/10/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Thrive!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Good afternoon, thanks and,how are you?yeah,I m available for discussion

19/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Thrive Duncan Tinarwo live in harare and has no electricity since yesterday because of the rains and wind damage some of the electricity lines.
19/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 71 254 1923: I'm his father
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand. Now, on that note, may I know if you are clear so that we can move ahead?
19/10/23, 8:19 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Yeah,I'm clear we can go head
19/10/23, 8:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $1500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $1500 - $1000 = $500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
19/10/23, 8:23 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Yes
19/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Noted
19/10/23, 8:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 8:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 29th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 29th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 8:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *29th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 254 1923: Sure,we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
19/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 828 3290: For now i dont have
