31/08/23, 10:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this Rutendo. I believe at such a high cost, you would have booked a fully furnished apartment?
31/08/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 408 1233: It doesn't have a bed
31/08/23, 10:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Well in that case, @263714081233, if you don't mind me asking, may I know why have you booked such an expensive accommodation? The average rent for an apartment with roommates is around $35 with the facilities to self furnish.
31/08/23, 11:00 pm - +263 71 408 1233: Won't the roommates be sharing the same beds and everything?

31/08/23, 11:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263714081233, each room would be shared by two people and if you are looking for more details about the accommodation, in that case, I would encourage you to please go through the document outlining the off-campus accommodation which was shared with you on Monday. 

Ms. Eugene is the right person to share the details about the accommodation available. We were hoping that you had already gone through the document, but if not, please take a moment to check it out and then let us know about your accommodation arrangements.
31/08/23, 11:25 pm - +263 71 408 1233: Send the document again it don't see it

31/08/23, 11:57 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263714081233 and we respect the same. Could you please share the receipt for the payment you made to reserve your accommodation? We need to submit the same receipt to the university along with the above-asked details as these would be needed for your FRRO process.
01/09/23, 12:04 am - +263 71 408 1233: What is an FRRO receipt
01/09/23, 12:10 am - Ashi Edoofa: Terrence, we are referring to the payment receipt of 20000 Rs for your accommodation reservation, not the FRRO.
03/09/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon, Parents and Rutendo,

As you prepare for your departure and get ready to board your flight from your home country, please take a moment to review the following messages. They contain important instructions for things you need to do before boarding your flight and tasks you'll need to complete upon your arrival in India.

*As per our records, your flight is scheduled to land in India on the 6th of Sep at 08:45 am at the Delhi Airport.*

Please read these instructions carefully and follow each one diligently. They are not only essential for your safety but also crucial to ensuring a smooth journey to India. We have full confidence that you understand the importance of these arrival instructions and will adhere to them accordingly.
03/09/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Things to do before departure:*

1. Kindly ensure that all of your luggage is properly labeled with your name and securely locked to guarantee safety during travel.

2. Make sure you get a covid test done and have a negative RT/PCR report with you.

3. Keep at least $150 cash handy with you. The easiest, most reliable way to convert your dollars into Indian rupees and to get the best exchange rate is to do so at the airport. Additionally, make sure to double-check the conversion rate online before exchanging the money.

4. Keep your passport and Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) handy for identification.

5. Before boarding your flight, take a picture of yourself at the airport and share it in your respective admissions group. This will help the team identify you upon your arrival at the airport.

6. Ensure to keep these contact details on a piece of paper and keep it handy: 
 Mr. Rithvik - +91 7696398732
 Ms. Vilsha - +91 81787 23499
 Mr. Mukund- +91 93546 23922
03/09/23, 3:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Post Arrival Instructions*

1. As soon as your flight lands, kindly connect to the wifi. You would need at least one to one and a half hours to check out and collect your baggage. Inside the airport, you will have to buy an Indian sim card which would cost you around $5-$7. Activate the SIM and call the officials whose contact details you have.

2.  Once you check out, do not leave the airport. The officials from the Edoofa team will be coming to the airport to receive you at 10:00 am. You can wait for the officials at KFC, near gate number 6, pillar number 17. I am also sharing the picture of the KFC with you for your reference.

3. When you meet the Edoofa Official, provide them with your full name and ask them to confirm your admission group name. Trust them only if they can verify the code. Rest assured, there will be no instance where the Edoofa Officials fail to receive you. Wait for them at the designated meet-up point and disregard any other individuals claiming otherwise or offering transportation services.

*Your Admission Group Code is: Rutendo 2K22MAR1777*

4. Please do not exit the airport premises until you meet the Edoofa team members. Do not take a taxi or bus from the airport to the university unless instructed to do so by the Edoofa team in person. Taxi drivers may approach you, but ignore them and wait for the Edoofa Official's guidance.

5. For your journey from the airport to the university campus, you will be boarding the university bus. The bus ride takes approximately 5-6 hours to reach the university campus. The Edoofa officials will assist you in boarding the bus. Remember to adjust your watch to be 03 hours 30 Minutes ahead of your time, as that will be the local time in India
03/09/23, 3:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please take your time to carefully review the above instructions, including the provided pictures of the designated waiting area at the airport. Additionally, make sure to go through the shared Travel Guidelines. Once you have read and understood everything, kindly send an acknowledgment here in the group.

Furthermore, we are sharing the undertaking form once again. If you have already filled it out, please share the scanned copy with us. Remember to bring the physical form with you to India and submit it when you meet the Edoofa Officials. In case you have not yet filled out the form, please ensure to do so today.

We hope this message finds you in good spirits. ☀️

I have an important update to share with you that the university officials have successfully concluded the process for setting up bank accounts specifically tailored for our international students. This marks a crucial step towards ensuring a seamless and enriching experience during your tenure at our university.
01/12/23, 10:38 am - +91 93546 23922: In order to open a bank account, all the students are required to visit any nearby branch of the *Punjab and Sind Bank*. To commence this process, it is mandatory for all international students to make a brief visit to the International Relations Office by today, before 4:00 PM. We've discussed the same with the Officials of the International Relations Department at Galgotias University and taken the liberty to prepare Bonafide letters for you since it is a mandatory requirement in opening a bank account with Punjab and Sind Bank.

When you drop by, kindly ensure to bring along a copy of your FRRO Registration Form. This will enable the officials to efficiently compile the necessary paperwork required for you.
