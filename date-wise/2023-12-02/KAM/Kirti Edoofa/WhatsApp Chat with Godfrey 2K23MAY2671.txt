18/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm available
18/10/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting and International Finance) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 833 7127: It's Bachelor's of commerce in Accounting
18/10/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, allow me to correct this, the course you've selected for your higher education is BCom (Accounting) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 71 833 7127: it is accurate
18/10/23, 4:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes l remember we were done with step 1, on step 2 l filled the online form
18/10/23, 9:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 71 833 7127: not yet
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 10:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes we are
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
18/10/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm done, thank you for sharing this,it sounds interesting
18/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 10:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 10:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Godfrey, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 10:20 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm following
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 10:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes
18/10/23, 10:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 10:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 10:38 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes go on
18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:42 pm - +263 71 833 7127: nothing ,lm understanding
18/10/23, 10:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 71 833 7127: uuum lm not aware ,you can provide
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement
18/10/23, 10:56 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes
18/10/23, 11:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
19/10/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Godfrey.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @263718337127 @263772670032?
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 267 0032: Blessed afternoon how are you
19/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 267 0032: Yes available
19/10/23, 12:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am happy to connect with you again, and I'd like to inquire if you are clear so far?
19/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 267 0032: Yes
19/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
19/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772670032 Greetings may I know if we are still connected?
19/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes
19/10/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
19/10/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/10/23, 3:47 am - +263 77 267 0032: Yes but my battery is low no electricity
20/10/23, 3:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Godfrey,

I hope this message finds you all in good health and high spirits. Thank you for sharing that I understand the challenges completely, we were looking forward to connecting with you and addressing crucial aspects related to your university admission process so may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was hoping to get a response from you however it seems like you are not available to respond, your absence has been having a negative impact on Godfrey's scholarship, I hope you are aware that the 2024 admissions are now open through Edoofa, and these delays will make Godfrey behind the peers, which is not a good sign, may I know if we are still connected?
20/10/23, 11:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 08:30 a.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
21/10/23, 8:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Godfrey,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning your university admission journey. With regard to our conversation yesterday. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?@263718337127 @263772670032
21/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 833 7127: how are you today,...uum l was busy
21/10/23, 9:22 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
21/10/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 833 7127: we can connect while lm doing my work now😓
21/10/23, 9:25 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please, I would not take much of your time, the discussion would only take 5 minutes if you are available.
21/10/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 833 7127: oky 5 minutes is good, lets start please
21/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
21/10/23, 9:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
21/10/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 833 7127: yes lm following
21/10/23, 9:32 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
21/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 833 7127: lm following
21/10/23, 9:37 am - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/10/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 833 7127: not yet ,we can move forward
21/10/23, 9:51 am - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
21/10/23, 9:52 am - +263 71 833 7127: yes lm excited 😊
21/10/23, 9:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. 
With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

15/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 833 7127: hello
16/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Godfrey.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now to move ahead with the discussion?
16/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 833 7127: l am available now
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 833 7127: 1.tution fee after scholarship is $900
2.the standard duration is September 2024-July 2027
3. $300 admission fee
4.750 USD
16/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/11/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/11/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 833 7127: we are following
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes lm following
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm clear
16/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/11/23, 1:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes we are together
16/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 3:46 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes explain to me please
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 3:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 4:02 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes we are on the same page
16/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 71 833 7127: oky so how long does it take to have this bank account
16/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm Mashonaland East but near Harare
16/11/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
16/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 71 833 7127: thank you😊
16/11/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.
17/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Godfrey.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation previously, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead and complete our discussion today regarding your university letter?
17/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 71 833 7127: lm available now
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that and thank you for telling me that. Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/11/23, 3:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 833 7127: oky thank you
17/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 833 7127: noted
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences. <This message was edited>
17/11/23, 7:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
17/11/23, 9:43 pm - +263 71 833 7127: l will prefer this one
17/11/23, 9:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, 

I hope you're in good spirits. Since it is past our available working hours now let us reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow at 08:30 am.
18/11/23, 8:09 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Godfrey,

I trust this message finds you in good health. With regard to the message above, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that I will be able to help you with your queries and discuss the letter in detail?
18/11/23, 11:15 am - +263 71 833 7127: sorry there is a network challenge this side
18/11/23, 11:16 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
18/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 833 7127: lm available now
18/11/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you would like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
18/11/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 833 7127: yes you can
18/11/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
18/11/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 833 7127: noted
18/11/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
18/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 833 7127: oky noted ....so l miscalculated it l thought it was around 3200
18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
18/11/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
18/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes lm following
18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
18/11/23, 12:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 833 7127: yes
18/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
18/11/23, 1:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
18/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 833 7127: l just wanted to know that is it the only university or some are not yet to send offer letters?
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Galgotias and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
18/11/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond since today is Saturday and our available hours were ill 01:30 pm, however, I extended for you, since it is beyond my working hours now, I will be connecting with you on Monday have a great day and weekend ahead.

20/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics.

28/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Godfrey.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you since as per our previous conversation you were to make a deposit of the first part by today, so I would like to know how is your preparation going on and if you have any updates to share?
28/11/23, 5:28 pm - +263 78 477 0482: Hi dear. We had a challenge yesterday which affected the payment which we were supposed to pay today. So um restragizing to pay next month. I'm really sorry. Is it ok

28/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263784770482 I am sure you will be however, what I am worried about is that you will lose this scholarship offer from Galgotias University, I do not wish for that. I understand that you might not be in a position to make the payment of the entire amount of $300 now, however, if you are able to work hard and are able to secure at least $100 and pay the same towards your fee before Thursday, 30th November 2023, I can once again have a conversation with the university officials and help you out, I am certain I will be able to present a strong case to you and your family.
28/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, since the 30th of November is when the university is closing the current rounds of applications, we wish to assist you before that date. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer. Therefore, it is essential for us to understand the plans you have in place so that we can help you out. Hence, can you please let me know if you are certain that you will be able to make the payment before the 30th so that I can have a discussion with the team accordingly?
28/11/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 477 0482: Will let you know tmrw if I'm able to make a payment the day after tmrw but what I was sure of is that will be able to pay everything by 28 December
28/11/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that circumstances can make a change of plans and it is not in your hands, however, that is why I am asking if you will be able to deposit $100 by the 30th of November so that I can have a discussion with the academic board and help you with a payment plan that will be convenient for you, I am here to assist you only?
28/11/23, 10:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings,

I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication since the university closes the round of applications on the 30th of this month and I will not be able to assist you after that?
29/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 477 0482: Hie how are you
29/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 78 477 0482: Sorry was busy
29/11/23, 7:18 pm - +263 78 477 0482: Will find money on 2 December that is when I will be able to pay 100 dollars is it ok
29/11/23, 9:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great, and thank you for sharing that update with me. I understand the challenges that you are facing so I have some information to share with you, you know we will be having a meeting with the university officials of Galgotias tomorrow and we will discuss the students' seriousness for their higher education and this month's performance as well. I can use this opportunity and help you here by discussing your case with them as well, what I suggest here you make the deposit of $100 by the 2nd of December and pay the next $250 on the 2nd of January 2024, and the remaining $250 on the 2nd of February 2024.

May I know if this will help you to ease your burden?
30/11/23, 4:13 am - +263 78 477 0482: Thank you so much, but is it okay if I pay it on the 15 of Jan and 15 of Feb is it OK because um certain thts when I will have money
30/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Godfrey.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing, however, I understand that you are going through challenges. While I empathize with you, you have to understand that you have applied for an International Scholarship, and there are certain rules of the scholarship that must be respected. Students all over the world are competing for this scholarship opportunity, and while we wish to assist you, the university has to be fair to reach every student.
30/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Considering that Godfrey is a student under the Edoofa Program, and we have made a promise to help you secure your scholarship seat, we can once again have a discussion with the university officials and see what can be done to allow you an extension until 15th January to secure your scholarship seat. However, given that you have also been granted the Endowment Grant of $150, it might not be possible for you to retain all the benefits.
30/11/23, 6:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In such a case, I believe as a parent, you have to make a decision. I can have a conversation with the university and help you process your admission as a regular application by 28th December, but that would mean letting go of the Endowment Grant of $150, and you will need to deposit $750. If you are okay with this, I can certainly take another step to help you out. However, sir, that cannot be done if you do not understand the importance of these due dates.
30/11/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 477 0482: It's OK will try to stick on the 2nd of these months
30/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would like to understand what happened all of a sudden, you can respond to this message by tomorrow since it is past my available hours and it has been a long day for me, have a great evening ahead.
01/12/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Godfrey

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. Since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday. Could you please confirm if we can connect with now?
