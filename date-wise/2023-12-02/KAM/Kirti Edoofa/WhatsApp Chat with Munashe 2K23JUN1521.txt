The past few days, we've been eagerly awaiting your response and engagement with the admissions team to progress on your university admission journey. Regrettably, despite our consistent efforts, we haven't received any communication from your end and this prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.

 May I please know the underlying reasons for your unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing?

02/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you for a while now but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. In our past conversation, you wanted to start with the discussion hence I am curious to know what happened all of a sudden that has led to your inactivity in the admissions group. If you are not going to be transparent with us regarding the concerns you are dealing with, I may not be able to help you here, please I would appreciate you communicate with us, if you think that you will not be able to share your concern in the group we can discuss over the personal window as well?

02/11/23, 7:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
02/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Yes I am available now
02/11/23, 7:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Yes i remember it
02/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
02/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 71 565 4624: For my university admission process, the edoofa team will work out on my scholarship application. The academic board will apply in multiple universities and once those universities accept my application they will send offer letters outlining my scholarship amount, annual tuition fee  and accommodation fee.with time when multiple universities accept my application for a scholarship,they will send offer letters and i will make a decision on which university i would like to study at
02/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
02/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 71 565 4624: So far no queries
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
02/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
02/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Yes we really excited
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
02/11/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
02/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 71 565 4624: I have reviewed the benefits
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Munashe, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
02/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 71 565 4624: I have understood
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 9:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 71 565 4624: Yes
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/11/23, 12:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I was hoping to get a response from you however, you did not respond. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
06/11/23, 4:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 4:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you on Saturday, however, you did not respond, and since it was the weekend the team was not available yesterday. May I know if you are available to connect with us npw?
07/11/23, 10:16 pm - +263 71 565 4624: I am available now
07/11/23, 10:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I am glad to know that we can connect now. So may I know if you are clear so far?
07/11/23, 11:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have been looking forward to hearing back from you, but it seems the day has stretched on, and we've reached the end of our working hours. Let's aim to reconnect again tomorrow at 1:00 p.m. Wishing you a restful evening. Good night!
08/11/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected with each other?
08/11/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to complete the admission process for Munashe, we have been delaying the process a lot. I would appreciate if you share your concerns if you have any with us openly and be active in this conversation. Given that we have not completed our timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of the process. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently and hoping to connect with you tomorrow at 10:00 am.
09/11/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 565 4624: Good morning sir
09/11/23, 11:02 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Munashe.

I hope you are doing well. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 565 4624: Yes i am available now
09/11/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
09/11/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 565 4624: Yes um clear
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
09/11/23, 11:18 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
09/11/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 565 4624: Yes i followed them
09/11/23, 12:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
09/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 565 4624: You may provide more information
09/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
09/11/23, 12:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
14/11/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: "Good day, Parents and Munashe,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
