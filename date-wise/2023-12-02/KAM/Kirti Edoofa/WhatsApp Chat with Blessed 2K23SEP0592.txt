11/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Thank you Sir for explaining further
11/10/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Yes Sir when to submit
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with these documents, I want you to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
12/10/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Are we using EWYL23E0687 or the one on the group information?
12/10/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Hallo l am asking if we use that number?
12/10/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773966229 The EWYL group is the group where the EWYL mentors will make sure Blessed is prepared to self-finance his education here in India. With his dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, he will earn maximum scholarship credits and since the student is not available parents can also join the group and attend the sessions. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake and yes you can use the same number to join the group through the link we provided you.
12/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The admissions group which is Blessed 2K23SEP0592 is different from the EWYL group. The admissions group is the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process.
12/10/23, 7:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263712954051 I have been expecting a response from you during the afternoon, and I was able to notice that you were able to go through my messages above, may I know if we are still connected?
12/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Yes
12/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Can l kindly reconnect and send by 0230pm tommorrow without fail
12/10/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please that is alright, I hope you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks by tomorrow 02:30 pm.
12/10/23, 9:26 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Sure l will. Thank you Sir
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/10/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 71 295 4051: True
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Yes
13/10/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
13/10/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Yes, will he be working though?
13/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773966229 I did  not get you well here, could you please help me understand your query well here?
13/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 295 4051: noted Sir
13/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Will he work and earn physical money while working?
13/10/23, 2:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query Mr. Zhou let me help you understand, through the EWYL program he would be given projects to work on and if he consistently works hard he would be rewarded with credits which he can directly use to further reduce his cost of education.

I hope we are clear now?
13/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
13/10/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 295 4051: ok
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
13/10/23, 2:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
13/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Ok
14/10/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Blessed.

I trust this message finds you in good health. Please accept my apologies for the delay in connecting as I had a busy schedule at work. I am available to connect now. Are you also available to engage with us at this time?
14/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 295 4051: am going to church l will be available on Monday . my apologies
14/10/23, 8:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: No need to apologize. I hope you have a peaceful time at church, and we can connect on Monday.
14/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 295 4051: Thank you Sir
16/10/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @263712954051 I was hoping to connect with you at 02:30 pm, and was expecting a response from you, may I know if we are still connected?
16/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Greetings Sir , can  l connect at 0230 tommorrow
16/10/23, 5:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however,may I know what are the challenges that you are facing?
17/10/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents, and Blessed,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you yesterday, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?
17/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 295 4051: How are you Sir
 

l was having board meeting at work yesterday
17/10/23, 1:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great and I understand that work can be a challenge during discussions, however, I appreciate you letting me know that. May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 295 4051: yes sir
17/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, so may I know if you are clear so far?
17/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Yes I am
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
17/10/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
17/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Noted Sir
17/10/23, 1:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 1:23 pm - +263 71 295 4051: It is clear Sir
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
17/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 295 4051: nice picture
17/10/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It was a heartwarming experience to finally meet them in person I hope you are excited to see Blessed in this picture for next year?
17/10/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 295 4051: very true . l like this
17/10/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am excited to hear that. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
17/10/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
17/10/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
17/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 295 4051: I have read the benefits
17/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
17/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
17/10/23, 1:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Blessed, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 295 4051: noted sor
17/10/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 295 4051: sir
17/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Sir
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Thank you. Noted Sir
17/10/23, 2:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
17/10/23, 2:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
17/10/23, 2:47 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Noted with thanks
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
17/10/23, 2:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 295 4051: thank you
17/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 71 295 4051: noted sir
17/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
17/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 295 4051: May you kindly clarify Sir on this
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
17/10/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
17/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Very clear now, it means the final  result will determine final quantum Sir
17/10/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, you are absolutely correct here. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
17/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 71 295 4051: True
17/10/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
17/10/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 295 4051: sure
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
17/10/23, 3:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
17/10/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Yes sure
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
17/10/23, 3:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
17/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Noted Sir
17/10/23, 3:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Ok Sir
17/10/23, 3:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 295 4051: no questions Sir
17/10/23, 3:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Blessed's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Blessed is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
17/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 71 295 4051: With pleasure Sir
17/10/23, 3:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 71 295 4051: l really appreciate Sir . Thank you goodday
02/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Blessed,

03/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you again.

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Goodday Sir, yes l read the letter and understood its contents

Above all, am happy that l am in possession of an offer letter
03/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
03/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
03/11/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 295 4051: yes Sir
03/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from *Galgotias University*. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
03/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 71 295 4051: sure
03/11/23, 3:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 71 295 4051: 1. 900us
2.4years
3.300us
03/11/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your answers to the first 3 questions I inquired, may I know if you were able to go through 4 question I inquired above?
03/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 295 4051: yes .300usd waived off from
03/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 71 295 4051: from first registration
03/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, I believe what you are referring to above is the admission procedure fee and what I have inquired above is the registration fee, I would please want you to go through the second page of the offer letter as well.
03/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 295 4051: We are suppose to deposit 750us so that we get admissions acceptance for Visa application
03/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct, and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a Four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you? <This message was edited>
03/11/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 295 4051: noted
03/11/23, 3:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. I am pleased that we've been able to make progress and are clear. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
03/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
03/11/23, 3:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
03/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Well received Sir
03/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
03/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 71 295 4051: yes
03/11/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
03/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 295 4051: clear Sir
03/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
03/11/23, 4:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Noted Sir
03/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 295 4051: yes sir please do
03/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Ok Sir let me wait for Mr Zhou so that we can work out on the modalities.  We have noted the dates. Sir
03/11/23, 5:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please we can definitely wait for Mr. Zhou and since you've got the dates noted, everything seems to be in order. Could you please let me know a time by which we will be able to connect with Mr. Zhou?
03/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 71 295 4051: On Tuesday he is out of the country in Botswana and not reachable
03/11/23, 6:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that Mr. Zhou must be occupied with work, however, since this is a very important discussion, I would recommend that we move ahead with the discussion and when Mr. Zhous is back home he can go through the conversation, and share his thoughts, may I know if this sounds acceptable to you?
03/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Sir can we kindly continue on Monday from 0900am now going to church and will be free on Monday. My request Sir
03/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that. Rescheduling to Monday can be possible, however, considering the time-sensitive nature, since the offer letter is issued by Universities that have certain guidelines. I would not suggest connecting on Monday and letting our two days go in vain because being your admission officer I would want to make you understand the offer letter so that you as a family can have enough time to think about it.
03/11/23, 6:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I do not mind connecting on Monday, but I would always want good for you so that you make the right decision in light of that, if you are not available to connect right now, we can even connect in the evening when the network is also stronger. So may I know if you would be available for 1 hour anytime from 08:00 pm to 09:30 pm?
03/11/23, 6:36 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Where am going there is no network . But Monday will be fine Sir
03/11/23, 6:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that network can be a hindrance to communication and as I mentioned above it is a time-sensitive nature since the offer letter is issued by Universities that have certain guidelines. So Monday will be a really long time, since we would be not connecting for two whole days, so may I know if you will be able to connect with us tomorrow?
03/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Am coming on Sunday. Will be available on the internet on Monday
03/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please thank you for sharing that, in that case, let us reconnect on Monday, please. Travel safe, have a great time at church, and have a great weekend ahead.
03/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 71 295 4051: thank you Sir, same to you
06/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessed.

I hope you are doing well and had a great weekend. With regard to our conversation earlier, I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 08:00 p.m. I hope you will be available to connect since letter discussion is an important aspect and 3 days have already past and I do not wish to delay the discussion more as I want you to have a better understanding of the letter.
06/11/23, 8:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, with regard to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now so that we can make progress and move ahead with the admission process?
06/11/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 08:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 12:28 am - +263 71 295 4051: How are you sir . l am Mr Zhou l have been out for church programme in Bostwana . We are so thankful for offering Blessed    acceptance letter .  l am now available for further discussions .
07/11/23, 12:32 am - bimol49: You deleted this message
07/11/23, 4:26 am - +263 71 295 4051: Noted Sir
07/11/23, 7:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents, and Blessed,

I trust this message reaches you in excellent health and good spirits. We are eager to get in touch with you to discuss vital matters concerning Blessed's offer letter. With regard to our conversation. Could you kindly confirm your availability for a connection at this time?
07/11/23, 9:22 pm - +263 71 295 4051: Goodday Sir
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/11/23, 11:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that circumstances may have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation. Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents. I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Good morning, Blessed and parents!

I hope this message finds you all in excellent spirits and good health. I am absolutely thrilled and bursting with excitement at the prospect of meeting you all in person, as we embark on a fantastic journey filled with boundless opportunities and a bright future 🚀. Let's join hands and create a path to excellence together! 🌟
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 396 6229: I am very sorry we are nolonger interested since some Universities in Zimbabwe recognize chemistry, biology and maths to to do pharmacy or medicine and money required in terms of tution and other basic needs question existence of a hundred percent scholarship.
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 396 6229: I can understand that. May I know if you have discussed the same with the Admission Team?
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Not yet
08/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Let me send the same to them.
08/11/23, 3:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessed.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing your thoughts of concerns with me, I really appreciate it. I will surely help you with your concerns, may I know if you are available to connect with us so that we can have a detailed discussion?
08/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 396 6229: At what time and when Sir?
08/11/23, 4:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: We can connect now if you are available @263773966229?
08/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Go ahead Sir.
08/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 396 6229: The challenge is we had heard that the conduct and clear ance from the school will determine full scholarship, but the fees given are too high for us.
08/11/23, 4:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please I am happy to connect with you again. Thank you for sharing your concern with me, however, as per your conversation with your EWYL mentor that you shared above could you please clarify if your concern is required for the course as you mentioned above or if the concern is related to the financial challenges that you mentioned right now?
08/11/23, 5:04 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Both financial challenges and course.
08/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Absolutely, I appreciate you bringing up your thoughts with clarity and openness. Let's tackle each point step by step. Regarding our last discussion about Blessed's academic path, I do remember that based on his results, pharmacy wasn't a viable option. It was agreed, with guidance from his counselor, that optometry could be a suitable alternative. We are certainly open to exploring additional medical-related courses that could align with his interests and capabilities.
08/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that the choice of course might not be the primary issue at hand, as the decision to pursue education in India was made with the recognition of the high-quality medical education available here. This was a choice you were comfortable with, valuing the educational standards we uphold.
08/11/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If I'm not mistaken, it seems the predominant hurdle at this moment is of a financial nature. Please correct me if I have misunderstood, or let me know if there are any other concerns we need to address.
08/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Financial challenges, but the course also counts though we can accept the offered one if fully sponsored because it seems cheaper for him to study in Zimbabwe.
08/11/23, 6:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing, I completely understand. However, to understand your financial concerns better, could you please help me understand which part of the offer letter from Galgotias University according to you is not affordable. Galgotias University is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

And the cost that we promised of $2000-$3000 your cost is within the same range and this cost includes your tuition fee, accommodation, examination fee, and food as well annually so maybe you could help me understand better?
08/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 396 6229: You have no visa and air ticket. Part of the university seems to be expensive
08/11/23, 9:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern. I would love to continue and help you with your concerns, however, since our available working hours are now over, I would love to connect with you tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a brief discussion regarding Blessed's offer letter.
09/11/23, 6:07 am - +263 77 396 6229: Ok including issues l raised
09/11/23, 8:28 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Blessed.

I hope you are doing well. Yes, please and thank you for acknowledging the message. I am looking forward to connecting with you today at 10:00 a.m.
09/11/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 396 6229: Fine but let us reach a fruitful point in our discussions.
09/11/23, 10:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings with regards to our conversation earlier, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 396 6229: Now a available
09/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 396 6229: Go ahead
09/11/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, kindly excuse me for connecting late since it is festival time here in India, hence we were a little occupied and there were some important meetings as well. Now coming back to the concern you mentioned above, as per my understanding I believe the financial concern that you have is related to the travel and visa expenses, could you please help me understand if my understanding is correct here?
09/11/23, 2:15 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Yes we heard that the scholarship excluded all these.
11/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Well, thank you for clarifying your concerns transparently. Let me help you understand better. Ideally, scholarships are provided only on the tuition fees however, since you are enrolled through Edoofa, we make sure to include accommodation and food within the cost range that was informed to you in your counseling sessions.

Now, coming back to your query again, traveling and visa fees are just one-time investments that you do not have to pay every year. Considering Zimbabwe's economy and the challenges you're facing in your current environment, have you thought about the long-term impact on Blessing if he continues to grow up in the same circumstances? Education is a one-time investment, and it rarely goes wrong. However, the choice of where to pursue that education is a different matter. If you are ready to invest in his future then why not the travel and visa expenses these will be only one time investments please.
11/11/23, 1:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Given the current economic situation in Zimbabwe, the challenges you're experiencing now could be a part of Blessing's life in the next 10 years if he stays there. On the other hand, if he secures admission, performs consistently in the EWYL program, and completes his education in India, his future could be considerably brighter.
11/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: India is renowned for its education, and upon returning to Zimbabwe, he could easily find a job earning $1000 to $1500 per month. However, if he decides to work in India, his potential for growth is even greater. In India, a fresher's basic salary is typically $5000 to $6000 per year, and this presents a significant opportunity for his career to flourish. With such an opportunity, your child would not only be in a better position than you are but also in a position to support you effectively.
11/11/23, 1:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I urge you to consider the long-term perspective and not just the immediate challenges. While the next 5-6 months might be challenging, it's a small sacrifice for your child's future growth and the opportunity to provide a better life for both himself and your family.
11/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 396 6229: Yes if given medicine or pharmacy we sacrifice
12/11/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings of the day.

I hope you are doing well. I would like to inform you that we will not be available as a team till the 13th of November and we will be connecting on the 14th of November on the occasion of Diwali also known as Deepavali, a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
12/11/23, 7:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

14/11/23, 12:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessed.

I hope you are doing well. It was a great time with my family during the festival. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to schedule our conversation for 05:00 pm CAT today. I hope you will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 295 4051: afternoon sir, noted with thanks
14/11/23, 5:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me it was our dinner break, however, we can connect now. May I know if you are available to connect now?
14/11/23, 7:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263712954051 I was hoping to get a response from you, may I know if we are still connected?
15/11/23, 4:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Blessed.

I hope you are doing well. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply. I understand that you must be occupied with your work, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected, as tomorrow stands your first deadline to secure your seat with the university for Blessed?
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - +263 77 396 6229: We can't afford 50 percent scholarship, visa and air ticket costs.
15/11/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me. I must express my disappointment regarding our recent discussions. Despite our daily efforts to connect and explain the situation, there seemed to be a lack of engagement from your end regarding Blessed's higher education. An open and responsive discussion might have led us to a solution if any concerns or problems had been communicated earlier.

Our Academic Board had genuinely considered your request and even planned to offer Blessed a new course in the medical field, accompanied by a substantial scholarship. Unfortunately, due to the lack of active participation in our discussions, these efforts have not borne fruit, impacting Blessed's future prospects.
15/11/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's regrettable that the opportunity at Galgotia's University has been missed. By reserving a seat at the university, you could have secured Blessed's academic path. At Edoofa, we are committed to our student's best interests and have even kept a transfer option available, which we couldn't discuss due to the lack of engagement from your side.
15/11/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I want to emphasize that education is a valuable investment. Reserving a seat at the university would have been a significant step in securing Blessed's future, especially considering India's renowned medical studies. My assistance remains available, but it requires a mutual interest in pursuing and enhancing Blessed's educational opportunities. Please remember, that investing in education is not just a commitment but a step towards a brighter future.

Thank you for asking, I am doing great. It has been a long time since we connected may I know how are you doing today?
