06/09/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Ruth,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Ruth's higher education?

10/10/23, 5:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening, Parents and Ruth.

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to get in touch with you and express my understanding regarding the difficulties you've been facing recently, which have led to your absence.

Over the last few weeks, I've been anticipating your response and observed that you haven't been able to engage with us. May I know if you are facing any challenges @263719749119 @263775987016 @263785661672 ?
11/10/23, 5:33 am - +263 78 566 1672: Morning Ma'am. We are all well thank you. Please note that Ruth is starting her final exams this coming week and she has been under a lot of pressure. Am also engaged in my first half semester exams so can we do this later.
11/10/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. Good morning! Thank you for the update. It's completely understandable that you both have academic commitments. Focus on your exams. However, please understand that we want you to connect because the 2024 admissions are now open only through Edoofa, and I do not want Ruth to miss this opportunity in such a case, what we can do is connect on Saturdays for 2 hours, where the work and study pressure is also less and you will be able to take out 2 hours easily. Does this plan sounds acceptable to you?
11/10/23, 10:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. Kindly excuse me for not connecting earlier, as I was occupied with some unforeseen work commitments, and I would love to answer your concern here however, as it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow afternoon at 12:30 pm. 

I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good night.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing the academic documents it is duly noted with us may I know if you are available to connect with us now?

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
24/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes we are
24/11/23, 1:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
24/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
24/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Step 5... The Admission Process. It sorely depends on the Earn While You Learn Program. To complete the application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare me for Statement of Purpose and then send it to their various Partner Universities.

Once you receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where my scholarship and fees would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, I  would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that i could start reducing my annual fee while I'll be in their country .
24/11/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
24/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 598 7016: No I don't
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
24/11/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. I would love to continue with our discussion, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
25/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well and excited about the weekend, with regard to our conversation yesterday since we were not able to continue with our discussion ahead may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
26/11/23, 1:06 am - +263 77 598 7016: Good day to you Ma'am
I'm sorry for the late reply
I'm sure I'll be available during the day for the session
27/11/23, 12:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth

I hope you're doing well and you had a great weekend since we were not available yesterday because of the weekend, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion?
27/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon
Yes I'm available for the session
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 598 7016: I have read the benefits
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Ruth, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
27/11/23, 11:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, so l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good afternoon ma'am
28/11/23, 1:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday?
28/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: may I know if you are clear so far?
28/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
28/11/23, 2:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/11/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Not really
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
28/11/23, 2:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
28/11/23, 3:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before December 10, 2023. The remaining $325 should be paid by January 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I've followed
I have no inquires
28/11/23, 3:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
28/11/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Do provide more information
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
28/11/23, 4:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
28/11/23, 10:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. Since it has been a long day for me, and our available working hours for today are now over, l will be connecting with you tomorrow to continue with our discussion ahead. Have a blessed night ahead.
29/11/23, 7:19 am - +263 77 598 7016: Good morning
Yes I understand
29/11/23, 1:41 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth.

I hope you are doing well, since we were unable to continue with our discussion yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Ruth 

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you following my previous message. However, I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet. Could you please confirm if we are still in communication?
01/12/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes ma'am
01/12/23, 4:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: May I know if you are clear so far?
01/12/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 6:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a student fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
01/12/23, 7:35 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 7:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
01/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes I agree
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
01/12/23, 7:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
01/12/23, 9:48 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Yes
01/12/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
01/12/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 598 7016: Good night
