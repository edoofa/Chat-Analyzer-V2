02/11/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
02/11/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I'm ready, we can start
02/11/23, 12:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have read the process you can explain
02/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/11/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
02/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I understand these steps
02/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
02/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I'm following. We can proceed
02/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
02/11/23, 1:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
02/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 753 6134: They are clear as well thank you
02/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
02/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We may start
02/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
02/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/11/23, 1:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
02/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I am ready you can share the videos
02/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
02/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

02/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
02/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As our available hours for Saturday are over we will be connecting with you on Monday. I hope you will be able to go through the videos by that time since it has been a long time since we have not able to move ahead from step 1 and if we keep moving at this pace we will not be able to start your EWYL program on the 7th November. Have a great day and weekend ahead.
04/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 296 0806: Noted with great dissappointement in nertwork connectivity this side hopefully will be available on Monday .blessed weekend to u too.
06/11/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 753 6134: Good morning
06/11/23, 12:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Shane

I hope you are doing well. I understand that network problems can be a serious challenge these days. With regard to our conversation on Saturday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes we are available
06/11/23, 12:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, so may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
06/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have been able to go through the videos
06/11/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that so could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos?
06/11/23, 12:53 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Oky in the first video i understood the need to be teachable and open minded and also to follów instructions and rules from Edoofa so that i can bear the confidence and pleasure of being a Proud Edoofian

In the sécond video i understood Edoofa's vision and it's focus on making students more responsible and independant

The third video shed some light on the various institutions in India under the Edoofa program and how the program can allow me to experience the good education and hospitality that these institutions can offer 

The fourth video explains the importance of the SOP for my smooth admission as it a document which can help me share some of my traits, achievements, strengths and weaknesses and be able to explain the real reasons i wish to be admiited into Indian institutions and it guarantees admission into the variety of Universities and Colleges depending on how it is presented
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Thank you for the view, it really explains the videos further
06/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 01:00 PM.
06/11/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

07/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Good morning Ms Kirti and the whole Admission Team. Here is my response for the Academic Interview Questions.
07/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 753 6134: <Media omitted>

07/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 753 6134: <Media omitted>

07/11/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 753 6134: 2.The difference between  rights and duties can be seen in various ways. Rights are entitlements which one acquires either naturally by being a human being or they can be based on civilisation.For example, every human being has a right to live. Duties on the other hand are things that one is expected to do by virtue of their position either as a citizen, a leader or any particular position. Every citizen has a duty to keep the environment clean and to respect the law.

Rights are the freedom that one has over their life so that they feel free and that they are  not vulnerable to harm by the people surrounding them.For example, one has a right to express their own opinion freely and a right to freedom. Duties are regulatory. A duty is a 'must' which one is automatically entitled to perfom either by the state or various organisations which they fall under. 

Human rights and civil rights also differ.Human rights are the rights one has simply for being a human being. Civil rights are contextual and one is entitled to specific civil rights through being a citizen of a particular country. Human rights apply internationally whilst civil rights may vary beacuse of citizenship in a particular nation. 

3.A prosecutor and an attorney have a variety of differences. A prosecutor is a legal officer who is responsibe for prosecuting the crime that a person would be charged with and be tried for. They work to provide evidence that indeed a person has committed the crime and they represent the interests of public safety.  An attorney on the other hand is a defense lawyer who works to defend their client who has been accused of a crime. These are usually hired to prove the innocence of their clients and to fight prosecution.

Prosecutors work for the government or the state to protect the rights of the public. They work on federal cases. Attorneys work to protect the rights of their client and to save them from falling victim to false charges and also to acquire reasonable sentences and punishments if the accused is found guilty. They can also give legal advice to clients. Therefore, the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney can be seen through the side on which one is working on, either to prove guilty or to prove innocent. 

4.I am most interested in studying Criminal/Corporate law. This is because of a number of reasons which include protecting the security of individuals and their interests. I'm interested in standing up against wrong-doing and making sure that the people surrounding me are safe from injustice. For example,  there are a lot of people out there who are not aware of the offensive nature of crime in the eyes of the law and they ignore crime as if it is normal in the society. I wish to improve people's lives through practising criminal law and fighting against injustice and ignorance of the law. 

Moreover, i also wish to bring criminals tojustice. 
I am very interested in working torwards the punishment of the wrong-doers and lawbreakers.
I also think that criminals must get fair charges for their offenses and suspects must be tried so that justice is not delayed. For example, crimes of rape, murder and assault must be tried and be awarded thorough punishments without fail. Therefore i am more interested in studying criminal law so that people get the justice they deserve but they are not aware of. 

5.I believe that i have a variety of skills which can make me a successful lawyer. These include good communication skills. I am someone who can communicate well with the people surrounding me to make sure we understand each other perfectly. For example, i am used to public speaking and addressing many people at once and i am also a good listener to be able to understand other's concerns. I also know how to communicate through writing and applying necessary registers. 

I also have good leadership qualities. For example, i am a senior prefect at my school and this has taught me skills of how to meet other people's needs and also provide justice and solve disputes. I can also work well with others in teamwork and i am very fond of organisation. For example, i am used to working with a team to achieve certain achievements such as clean environments and i always make sure to follow my home made daily routine to meet my daily goals.

09/11/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Thank you
09/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. We will be connecting on the 14th of November since we have one of the biggest festivals coming up Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is a major Indian festival often referred to as the "Festival of Lights." It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 12:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

I hope you are doing well. It was a great time with my family during the festival. As we can connect now and move ahead with the discussions I would like to inquire if you are available to connect with us now?

14/11/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright please, these things happen sometimes. I'm sure once he resolves his connectivity problems, he'll get back here, in the meantime may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
14/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 296 0806: Yes I am
14/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of his university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in his admission journey.*
14/11/23, 3:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course bachelor of Arts in Legislative Law for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
14/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Good afternoon Ms Kirti.  Hope you had a good time during your holiday. We are available we can continue
14/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes that is correct
14/11/23, 3:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I had a really wonderful time with my family. Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
14/11/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes i am ready please go ahead
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
14/11/23, 5:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
14/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I agree. One cannot study at multiple universities at the same time
14/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
14/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
14/11/23, 5:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
14/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We understand and the counsillor had discussed this with us
14/11/23, 6:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
14/11/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes we are on the same page
14/11/23, 6:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
14/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have taken note
14/11/23, 7:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example. Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid within the first three days of your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 78 753 6134: So does this mean that we have to pay the university registration fee which is approximately $1000 as per the example within a certain deadline then the $350 after arrival in India and this amount will cover the whole first-year tuition
14/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
14/11/23, 7:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We understand. But i have one question. When can we expect the offer letters so that we may prepare for the registration fee?
14/11/23, 7:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263787536134 as we move ahead with step 4 all your queries shall be answered as well. May I know if you are excited to move towards step 4?
14/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 753 6134: When paying the annual tuition fee at the University do we pay in installments or it is required in once-off payment
14/11/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok we may proceed i am excited to complete more steps
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please all your concerns would be answered as we move ahead.
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/11/23, 7:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We can't wait to reach this stage it will truly be a stepping stone for us
14/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 753 6134: These people really look happy i also wish that one day i will be a part of one such photo and pursue my dream with Edoofa
14/11/23, 9:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed, it was heartwarming to meet with them, and I am looking forward to meeting you as well. I am sure you are excited to be part of next year's batch and I would love to continue with our discussion, however, since it is past our available hours now, let us reconnect tomorrow at 04:30 pm.
16/11/23, 12:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Shane,

I trust this message finds you in good health. Since we were unable to continue our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 296 0806: Good afternoon to u too.I'm afraid Shane is currently in an examination right now.He will contact you once he gets back.
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I shall wait for his response.
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 296 0806: Thank you very much
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.
16/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Good afternoon. I'm available now we can continue with our discussion
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we can connect now. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
16/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We are really glad that you are working towards quality education. We are also doing the same and we also believe we will shape a brighter future indeed
16/11/23, 2:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/11/23, 2:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have reviewed the benefits
16/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 753 6134: We can continue
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
16/11/23, 3:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means Shane, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/11/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 753 6134: This is an exciting opportunity indeed
16/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 753 6134: It is so benefitting
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes it does resonate with me
16/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Kindly excuse me for not responding earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. I'll be concluding our session for today as I have another batch of students to attend to. It was a great time with our session, let's plan to conclude our session tomorrow. So let us connect starting from 12:30 PM onwards tomorrow. Have a great day, and please convey my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
17/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes we may continue the discussion
17/11/23, 3:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if you are clear so far?
17/11/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Indeed i am clear so far
17/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
17/11/23, 6:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/11/23, 7:52 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Shane,

I trust this message finds you in good health. I had anticipated receiving a response from you, but it appears that you haven't had the opportunity to reply, although I did notice that you have read my previous message. May I kindly ask if we are still connected?
18/11/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 753 6134: Good morning. We are still connected
18/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 753 6134: This explains a lot and it's good to know that Edoofa will be helping out with the registration fee
18/11/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/11/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/11/23, 10:41 am - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/11/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have understood the details. Please go further
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Explain a bit to get more clarity
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
18/11/23, 1:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
18/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I am now familiar with how the scholarship quantam is assessed
18/11/23, 1:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Yes that is correct
18/11/23, 1:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
18/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I agree
18/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
18/11/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
18/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 753 6134: It's clear
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
18/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
18/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Does this mean the higher education period will increase
18/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No please a diploma degree is also for 3 years.
18/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok it is clear now
18/11/23, 2:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
18/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I understand
18/11/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
18/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I have no queries. We can move forward.
18/11/23, 2:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
18/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 753 6134: I am indeed excited for the next steps and i'm also curious about the offer letter
18/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
18/11/23, 2:29 pm - +263 78 753 6134: Ok you also have a blessed day ahead
18/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you.
27/11/23, 10:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 11:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Shane,

This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
