As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Tafadzwa's higher education?

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session.

18/10/23, 8:07 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Ooh yes let me send now
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:11 pm - +27 67 073 4530: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the academic documents, it is duly noted with us. Before we move ahead with the discussion.  I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Positive🙂
18/10/23, 8:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 8:29 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes yes l remember
18/10/23, 8:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - +27 67 073 4530: So if l recall, you basically put my application through to different universities with a statement of purpose that you make. Then we will have to wait for their response
18/10/23, 8:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 8:36 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes .Actually l want to know if it is possible for the universities to reject my application. Maybe because l do not qualify or meet their requirements
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, yes it is certainly possible however, you do not have to worry here, because your eligibility was already checked by our counselors and such a case, has never occured.
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Alright noted thank you
18/10/23, 8:39 pm - +27 67 073 4530: We can move on now
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Perfect yes lm listening
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
18/10/23, 8:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - +27 67 073 4530: We can proceed
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students  A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
18/10/23, 9:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Tafadzwa, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Wow that’s a great privilege
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
18/10/23, 9:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:52 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understandable 😊
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
18/10/23, 9:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
18/10/23, 9:55 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Noted
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
18/10/23, 9:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
18/10/23, 10:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 12:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 12:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa.

I trust you are in good health. In relation to our discussion from yesterday, I'd like to inquire if you are currently available to continue our conversation and make progress @27670734530 @27615986736 @27788590184?
19/10/23, 12:31 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Hello. I'm well thanks
19/10/23, 12:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that so may I know if you are clear so far?
19/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings @27670734530 may I know if we are still connected?
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: We are clear
19/10/23, 3:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Sorry network issues
19/10/23, 3:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, I understand. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 3:30 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes may l please know the costs of admissions or ranges if there isn't a specific amount
19/10/23, 3:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Could you please help me understand your query better, in our discussion in May we explained all the cost breakdowns to you, if you want I can reiterate it for you. I just wanted to know if you have any queries further?
19/10/23, 4:27 pm - +27 67 073 4530: No l did understand the breakdowns it's just the specific amount for registration that l want to know
19/10/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand every university has its own specific registration amount however, to be on the safer side, we encourage parents to prepare themselves with the $750 so that if the amount is extra it can be used further in the future.

I hope we are clear now?
19/10/23, 6:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Clear
19/10/23, 6:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 6:53 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes l am
19/10/23, 7:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
17/11/23, 10:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Tafadzwa,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
17/11/23, 10:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 06:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
17/11/23, 10:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 06:00 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

18/11/23, 6:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Tafadzwa!
I trust you are doing well.

I am Mr. Milan Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa. In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
18/11/23, 6:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
18/11/23, 6:26 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Greetings sorry for being late
18/11/23, 6:26 pm - +27 67 073 4530: I'm connected
18/11/23, 6:27 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Well we are very much excited about this.
18/11/23, 6:28 pm - +27 67 073 4530: I noticed there are A'level results that are said to be pending wanted to know if you have noted that too.
18/11/23, 6:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, you can stay assured of that. The statement mentioned in the letter is included in the format of the letter that is same for all the students, therefore, it is written in Tafadzwa's offer letter as well.
18/11/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 6:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 6:35 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Noted we can proceed thank you
18/11/23, 6:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 6:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 6:42 pm - +27 67 073 4530: 1.900usd
2.5years
3.100usd
4.300usd
18/11/23, 6:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 6:46 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes noted
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 6:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 6:50 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Well noted but is the mentioned amount per student or will be divided amongst the students
18/11/23, 6:51 pm - +27 67 073 4530: So on the off campus accommodation, are there sharing rooms or it's individual
18/11/23, 6:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Certainly! The mentioned accommodation fees are per student. Each student occupying the room or availing the accommodation facility is generally required to pay the specified amount individually. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 6:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: The type of accommodation for off-campus stays varies. Generally, university-approved off-campus accommodations offer sharing rooms where students share the living space with roommates. However, there could also be options for individual rooms, especially if students choose to independently find accommodations. I hope this is clear as well?
18/11/23, 6:55 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood
18/11/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 6:56 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Clear too
18/11/23, 6:57 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood
18/11/23, 7:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 7:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: So the examination fee goes for all the 5years right?
18/11/23, 7:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Absolutely, that's correct! The examination fee, as mentioned in your offer letter, is applicable for each semester throughout your entire five-year program. Hence, it sums up to $200 annually for the entire duration of the course, covering the examinations conducted every semester. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:17 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood
18/11/23, 7:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 7:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - +27 67 073 4530: So to understand this. There is a need for the 750 and the 300 too?
18/11/23, 7:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please dear. In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 7:38 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood but that is basically almost R14 000 so must it all be paid once or in installments
18/11/23, 7:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that. Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 7:56 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes please explain
18/11/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 8:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 8:39 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Noted
18/11/23, 8:39 pm - +27 67 073 4530: The first one is better
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Indeed, it helps you with giving a flexibility in terms of the time period. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
18/11/23, 8:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
18/11/23, 8:51 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Currently in South Africa
18/11/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. On that note, I was going through your application file and I noticed that you made the payment of your enrollment fee using Mama Money, right?
18/11/23, 9:45 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes right
18/11/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. On that note, once you would be ready to make the payment, you can then let us a day before so that we can get the Mama Money Order generated for you. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Tafadzwa, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

Let's reconnect with each other here on Monday at 12.00 PM CAT to continue with our conversation. Until then, have a blessed day ahead, and if you have any immediate concerns, don't hesitate to leave a message here. Thank you and take care.
18/11/23, 9:59 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Much appreciated thank u bye
20/11/23, 8:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafadzwa!
I hope this message finds you well.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I regret to inform you that I need to reschedule our ongoing discussion regarding the offer letter from Galgotias University. An urgent matter has arisen that requires my immediate attention.

Due to that, I propose rescheduling our conversation to a new time slot. Could we reconvene today at 01.00 PM CAT in order to move ahead with our conversation? May you, please let me know if this new time suits you, or if you would prefer an alternative time that fits your schedule better.
20/11/23, 9:38 am - +27 67 073 4530: Noted thank you
20/11/23, 1:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa!

I am glad to reconnect with you here. Now, as we're about to reconvene our discussion shortly, I trust you're ready to continue with our conversation as per the schedule?
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Greetings
20/11/23, 1:54 pm - +27 67 073 4530: We can continue with the discussion if you are still available
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please let us move ahead with that. Now, before we proceed, may I know if you are clear till here please?
20/11/23, 3:26 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes clear
20/11/23, 3:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 3:46 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Noted
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Tafadzwa!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes we can connect
21/11/23, 2:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can move ahead?
21/11/23, 3:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Clear but l wanted to know about how we pay the tuition fee and the accommodation as well. 

We have 2 semesters right so the tuition is paid as per semester or once for the year?
21/11/23, 3:11 pm - +27 67 073 4530: And another thing if it's paid per semester is it needed at the beginning of the semester or at the end.

For instance if l am to start the semester  on the 1st of January till in June, when exactly must l pay the tuition
21/11/23, 3:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you with that please. Regarding the tuition fee payment, as mentioned earlier, the per semester tuition fee after the scholarship is $900. You have two semesters in an academic year, so the total annual tuition fee is $1,800. Now, the university expects the tuition fee to be paid at the beginning of each semester or academic term so that the students can continue with their classes without any hassle.

For example, if your semester begins on August 1st and ends in January, the payment for that semester's tuition fee would generally be expected at the beginning of the semester. Therefore, you would be required to pay the $900 for that specific semester at or around the start of August. I hope you are clear with this?
21/11/23, 4:05 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Yes. And the accommodation? Is it also paid per 6months or it's a once off payment
21/11/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: For accommodation, it depends on the type of accommodation that you will choose. In case of on-campus accommodation, the fee is required to be paid at once.

However, when it comes to off-campus accommodation, you would have even more flexibility to the extent that you can pay on a monthly basis. I hope this is understood as well?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood so the $800 is basically the amount needed for the off campus accommodation right?
21/11/23, 4:09 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Or it's just an approximation
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. That is very right. Moving ahead, It is the amount that students normally pay for the whole year for their accommodation and food. I hope this is clear?
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Clear
21/11/23, 4:17 pm - +27 67 073 4530: We can move on thank you
21/11/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 4:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 4:46 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Noted
21/11/23, 4:46 pm - +27 67 073 4530: So are the EWYL projects the same as the ones lm still me busy with right now?
21/11/23, 5:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear. The EWYL Projects are similar to the ones that you are doing as of now and there will be more different projects coming up that your mentor will inform. I hope this is understood?
21/11/23, 5:05 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Understood
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 5:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
21/11/23, 5:13 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Clarified
22/11/23, 8:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Tafadzwa!
I trust this message finds you well. I hope you've had a good start to your day.

Regrettably, our conversation was interrupted yesterday before we could conclude our discussion. As we weren't able to finish our conversation, I'm reaching out to ask if we can reconnect here now to continue where we left off and proceed with our discussion regarding the offer letter?
22/11/23, 8:21 am - +27 67 073 4530: Morning is it possible if we meet at 6pm today
22/11/23, 8:23 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your comfortable time with me here please. About that, I would like to mention that my working hours are only till 04.00 PM, therefore, we must have to conclude the conversation before 04.00 PM here today.
22/11/23, 8:27 am - +27 67 073 4530: Ok at 12pm then
22/11/23, 8:36 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, we will connect with each other here around 12.00 PM please and then we will proceed with our conversation regarding your offer letter.
24/11/23, 6:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Tafadzwa!

I am *Ms. Kirti, Admission Officer at Edoofa*, I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
25/11/23, 8:30 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Tafadzwa

I hope you are doing well. I hope this message reaches you in good health. I have been looking forward to a response from you however, you did not respond., I understand that you might not have had the chance to reply yet and must be occupied with some work. Could you please confirm if we are still connected?
30/11/23, 2:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon to Parents and Tafadzwa,

I trust that you are in good health. I've been eagerly awaiting your response, but I realize that you may have had other commitments or responsibilities that have kept you from replying. If it's convenient for you, could you kindly confirm whether our communication is still active? Your acknowledgment would be appreciated.
30/11/23, 10:45 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Greetings ma'am my apologies for not being present we are currently having a financial crisis and will unfortunately won't be able to get the registration fee that is due tomorrow. Hence we have sadly come to a conclusion that we l will withdraw my application for the time being and if possible will probably resume with the program as soon as we get money.

It really hurts me to stop a process at this stage but we calculated as a family and we noticed that for the time being our financial status is really not supportive.
30/11/23, 10:45 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Please let me know if there are any formalities l must go through to reserve my Edoofa membership privilege 🙏Thank you
01/12/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Tafadzwa.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for sharing that with me, I understand that financial challenges can be a challenge, however, giving up is not a solution please, could you please help me understand your challenges better so that I can understand you and assist you accordingly?
01/12/23, 6:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings may I know if we are still connected I have been anticipating your response during the afternoon @27670734530 @27615986736 @27788590184 ?
01/12/23, 7:05 pm - +27 67 073 4530: This message was deleted
01/12/23, 7:05 pm - +27 67 073 4530: Good evening. Sorry for being late. Actually we are finding it difficult to raise the registration fee that is needed. And not only that, we are also having a financial breakdown as a family so it will be even more difficult to meet up all the needed amounts like the flight ticket, tuition as well as the visa fee. 🤦‍♀️😭
01/12/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @27670734530 I understand that you are facing challenges, and I am here to assist you please, however, for that I would please encourage you to help me understand the challenges that your family is going through financially?
