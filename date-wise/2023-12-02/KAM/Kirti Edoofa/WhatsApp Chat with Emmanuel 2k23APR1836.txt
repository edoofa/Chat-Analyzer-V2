18/08/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 341 4960: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
18/08/23, 8:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
18/08/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Sorry he isn't responding....
Something is wrong with his phone please understand...
But he can use my phone
18/08/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright since this group wants parents equal involvement in the discussions, may I know if you are available to continue with the discussion?
18/08/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes let's proceed
18/08/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now to be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communication for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
18/08/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes that's correct
18/08/23, 8:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Glad to know that. Now, we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. counseling on university admission, are you ready to start with that?*
18/08/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Yes
18/08/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! Now, for your university admission process, we will be closely working on your scholarship application, and as we promised, we will be sharing your scholarship application with multiple universities that are applicable to your course and are recommended by the Academic Board.
18/08/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once those universities accept your application, they will send you the offer letters outlining your scholarship amount, annual tuition fee, and accommodation fee, as well as your university registration fee.
18/08/23, 8:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With time, when multiple universities accept your application for a scholarship, they will send you the offer letters, and in the end, you will have offer letters from multiple universities. I am sure you will agree that it is not possible for you to practically study at multiple universities, right?
18/08/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Yes😄
18/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
18/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
18/08/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
18/08/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Yes he did
18/08/23, 8:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
18/08/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Yes understood
18/08/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
18/08/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Yep
18/08/23, 8:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
18/08/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Sure
18/08/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
18/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 530 8270: No I've understood
18/08/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 530 8270: Thank you for the clarity
18/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 341 4960: I will respond shortly after reading
18/08/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. You are most welcome. Alright, now Emmanuel, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well. <This message was edited>

04/11/23, 12:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Emmanuel.

I trust this message finds you in good health. I've managed to conclude my work engagements sooner than anticipated today and was wondering if this might be a convenient time for you to engage in a discussion with us?
04/11/23, 2:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond. As our available hours for Saturday are over we will be connecting with you on Monday. Have a great day and weekend ahead.

06/11/23, 11:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Emmanuel.

I hope you are doing well. By the time you responded it was past our available hours for Saturday so we were not able to connect with you. That is alright please I understand that completely.  I would like to inquire if you will be available to connect with us now?
06/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Hello please move to evening  im a bit tied up .
06/11/23, 12:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely understand that you must be occupied with work, however, we have not been able to have a smooth conversation for many days and this is delaying Emmanuel's admissions process, please. Many parents have started with the admission process and already reserved their children's seats with the university I am afraid if we keep moving at this place Emmanuel will fall behind his peers.
06/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Im sorry bt sometimes u dont give me scheduled time like  last yu said we shld expect a letter in the next 5 or 6 days bt  nothing came .

06/11/23, 12:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, today I also had an unexpected meeting with one of the universities and that is why I did not confirm the timings of the discussion. Regarding your concern about the offer letter, I would like to inform you that as mentioned above you can expect a letter within 3-5 days after our discussion is completed, however, we were never able to move ahead with discussion only.
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Okay
06/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So where do we stand now cause the last task we were given was to send documents we dd than

06/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 77 341 4960: 🙌
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to connect with you today. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 8:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
06/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Im done reading we can proceed
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 8:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Emmanuel, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Understood
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 8:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes its does
06/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/11/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes it does so does it mean we still owe edoofa a total of 150?
I thought my brother had finished?
06/11/23, 8:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please what you are referring to is the Edoofa enrollment fee this $750 is the registration fee which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
06/11/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So this 150 is it us paying or edoofa please clarify more on tht
06/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 77 341 4960: When we were hqving sessions wth mr sahil we paid money that time and it was said to be the only money we pay before admision so im confused maybe i missed a part
06/11/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you here. Since your year of intake is 2024 and the admissions fro 2024 intake are now open through Edoofa, for that time being you were only to pay the Edoofa enrollment fee and you were to start preparing for your admission process may I know if you recall that you counselor informed you about the registration fee of $500 - $750?
06/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes
06/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 341 4960: I recall
06/11/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing now this registration fee is nothing but a part of your first year tuition fee as I cleared above here, right?
06/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So the registration fee will be paid only if we get the offer letter?
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please and a part of your registration fee will be covered by Edoofa, hence you will only have to pay $600 to reserve your seat with the university however, the full amount of $750 will be adjusted towards your first-year tuition fee.
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes i have understood
06/11/23, 10:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 10:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from you however, as it has been a long day for me and our available working hours are now over so let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm, have a great night ahead.
07/11/23, 1:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and  Emmanuel.

I hope you are doing well. That is alright, please, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
07/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes im available
07/11/23, 1:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, so may I know if you are clear so far?
07/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes we are clear
07/11/23, 1:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great, now may I know if you were able to go through the message above?
07/11/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes i went thru the msgs
07/11/23, 1:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that, so may I know if you are aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 341 4960: If u may  please i will be glad to read more
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Okay
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
07/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes thts true
07/11/23, 2:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
07/11/23, 2:25 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes i do agree
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
07/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
07/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes and its fair enough
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
07/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes its clear
07/11/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
07/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Ok
07/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So if he decides nt to go ahead with a bachelors he will serve edoofa for 1year? Doing  job oriented projects?
07/11/23, 3:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please he can either do a diploma or if he does not wish to continue with the studies he can gain experience with us while working on the EWYL job-oriented projects which will help him learn more skills and make him employable ready.
07/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Thats fair enough
07/11/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
07/11/23, 5:25 pm - +263 77 341 4960: At the moment .bt i just wanted to know tht as we will be waiting for results in january what is the next thing we should be doing at the moment
07/11/23, 6:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263773414960 at this moment you are expected to prepare yourself with the $600 to reserve Emmanuel's seat with the university which through the endowment plan can be paid in two installment of $300 each, may I know if you are clear so far?
07/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So this is after the  offer letter right?
07/11/23, 6:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. As Emmanuel's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that he is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
07/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes
07/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Nw we are waiting for the letter
07/11/23, 6:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
07/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Thank yu maam kirti for todays session .have a good evening .Namaste🙂
07/11/23, 7:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I really appreciate you learning new words. You're welcome! I'm glad I could be of help in today's session. Namaste and have a great night ahead.

18/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes i went through it
18/11/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Noted
18/11/23, 6:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 6:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 6:44 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Per semester-900USD On scholarship 
Standard Duration of course- 6 semesters in 3years
Admission qnd procedure fee-300USD
Registration fee-750USD
18/11/23, 6:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes it does
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 6:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So would yu have an idea of the food served there will there be international dishes?
18/11/23, 6:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: At Galgotias University, the on-campus dining facilities usually offer a diverse range of meals, including international dishes. They provide various options, including mostly Indian cuisine. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 6:55 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes
18/11/23, 6:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes it does
18/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Which city is this university
18/11/23, 7:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Regarding that, stay assured that I will be sharing all the information about the university towards the end of our discussion. Moving ahead, I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
18/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes
18/11/23, 7:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
18/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes its clear
18/11/23, 7:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
18/11/23, 7:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
18/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 341 4960: This i dont follow
18/11/23, 7:12 pm - +263 77 341 4960: So if we pay 750 what happens to the 300 that was said to be going for registration
18/11/23, 7:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Please yu may explain
18/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yu said 1st of december i noticed on the form its written 15working days  so is this for registration or for the seat
18/11/23, 7:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that the mentioned date is for completing the registration process. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes and yu stated that securing the registration is by paying thats why i asked this
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please that is right, and we are coming to discuss that moving ahead during our discussion. Now, In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
18/11/23, 7:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
18/11/23, 7:58 pm - +263 77 341 4960: 15 working days excludes the weekends right  and as the issue day was the 17th we will be having 9days only and that wont be 15days
18/11/23, 8:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that the 15 working days that are mentioned is applicable on the situation when the complete $750 is being paid. Now, in this case, since we are working on a payment plan that further splits the payment into two parts, therefore, the deadline is counted as 15 days from the date of the isse of the letter. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Still if iur deadline is on the 1st of december it will be 13days
18/11/23, 8:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: No, please. Let me help you with the same please. 15 days of deadline from 17th to 01st December also counts those respective dates as well. I hope this is understood?
18/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Ok
18/11/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
18/11/23, 9:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
18/11/23, 9:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Dear Parents and Emmanuel, since my working hours for the day are now over and it is late on my end here, we would be concluding our discussion for now. I appreciate your active participation and cooperation in going through the offer letter details.

20/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 895 9334: Hi this is Emmanuel
20/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 71 895 9334: Sorry I've been occupied lately
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.

My sincere apologies for not being able to connect earlier as I was occupied in an urgent meeting that demanded my immediate attention. Now that I've resolved those matters, I'm back and ready to continue our discussion.

May I know if we can connect with each other here now in order to proceed with our conversation about your offer letter?
21/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 895 9334: Let's proceed
21/11/23, 2:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, may I know if you are clear till here so that we can proceed with our conversation?
21/11/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 895 9334: Yes let's proceed ma'am I understood
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/11/23, 2:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 341 4960: We are in harare and the person responsibke for the payment has a nostro forex account
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/11/23, 3:28 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Okay.will forward the msgs to emmanuels uncle and he will get back to us and i will inform yu
21/11/23, 3:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/11/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through the Bank Details mentioned in the offer letter by using a Telegraphic Transfer/International Bank Transfer.

The transfer charges for that mode would be informed to you when you will connect with the Bank Officials please. I hope this is clear? <This message was edited>
21/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Noted
21/11/23, 4:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
21/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Bt emmanuel once suggested to stay on campus
21/11/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 341 4960: I thought we had an option to choose.for a foreign  teenager  for us we find it safe and more convenient for him to live on campus .
21/11/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please, I understand where you are coming from, however, on that note, I would like to mention that since on-campus accommodation is quite expensive in terms of costs, and that is why almost all the students consider the off-campus option.
21/11/23, 4:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, being your admission officer, I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes.

Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the assurance that you needed, right?
21/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Okay
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes thts underandable
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
21/11/23, 4:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
21/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 341 4960: Yes its clear
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
21/11/23, 4:53 pm - Milan Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
22/11/23, 10:41 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Emmanuel!
I hope you are doing well today.

I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter here. May I know by when can we connect with each other here again for the same?

Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
23/11/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
23/11/23, 3:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263718959334 It has been around 4 hours since I have been expecting a response from your side. May I know if we are still connected with each other here?

Especially Mrs Saloni
23/11/23, 4:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Ms. Kirti, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Friday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
