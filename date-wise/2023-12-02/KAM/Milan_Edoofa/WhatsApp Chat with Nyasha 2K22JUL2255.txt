12/09/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Nyasha,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. I am *Ms. Kirti, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As we had promised that after August 2023, we would proceed with your admission process, I am excited to inform you that we are ready for the commencement of the university application process for your higher studies for the intake of 2024. However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Nyasha's higher education?
13/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 346 3259: We are all well thanks for the update
13/09/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Hope you are also doing well
13/09/23, 3:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon, Parents and Nyasha,

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great and I'm delighted to hear that you and your family are doing well. It's wonderful to know that you've been keeping in good health and high spirits. 

As we come to the conclusion of the 2023 intake, I'm excited to provide you with a glimpse of our Proud Edoofians.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM.

Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.

20/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 407 2653: You can go ahead Madam
20/09/23, 2:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok I heard that the first stage is of talking with the fore founders of edoofa and being given the rough idea of what edoofa is all about 
Secondly, there is the statement of purpose whereby you outline whatever you like to implement for example community building and also the program 
Thirdly,there are counseling sessions by some mentors on how best can a student be able to be accommodated by edoofa maybe through some earn while you learn programs amongst many others.
Adding on, there is offering of a letter to the universities and colleges that offer the various programs and law in my case.
Moreso, waiting for the acceptance letter from the universities and registering as a student of a particular University and lastly the processing of Visa and other final documents
20/09/23, 2:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
20/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 407 2653: No queries for now Madam
20/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 407 2653: You can go ahead
20/09/23, 3:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are ready to start with your Admission process for the year 2024?
20/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yeah we are ready
20/09/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 346 3259: And what are the requirements for the admission process
20/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss them. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
,
20/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
20/09/23, 9:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

20/09/23, 11:23 pm - +263 71 346 3259: I'm also motivated towards achieving those goals towards a brighter future for me, my community and family

09/10/23, 8:01 pm - +263 77 407 2653: Greatly noted
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
09/10/23, 8:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - +263 77 407 2653: May you go ahead and discuss pliz
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
09/10/23, 8:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Nyasha, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
09/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 407 2653: May you go ahead
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
09/10/23, 8:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
09/10/23, 10:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening.
10/10/23, 12:21 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Hello how are you doing today,I'm so good.i hope that I find you well, everything is ok about your explanations
10/10/23, 12:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Nyasha.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for asking, I am doing great and I am glad to know that everything is clear to you, with regard to our conversation yesterday may I know if you are available to connect with us now for a discussion?
10/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I am available
10/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that so may I know if you are clear so far?
10/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes everything is clear
10/10/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 1:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I get right
10/10/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Sorry for the late reply I was attending a lesson
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I understand that completely. 

*4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 4:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes understood
10/10/23, 4:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 346 3259: I think it might be good to wait for the a level results and proceed as Soon as they are out
10/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I completely respect your decision, however, there are benefits offered with the endowment plan apart from the financial ease, which can be considerate for Nyasha.
10/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok so I can take that option because I need the benefits
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you understand further. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 4:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok so I like it it's a good idea
10/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok well noted
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes now I understood the concept
10/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok I am fit to take it
10/10/23, 4:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok yeah well noted
10/10/23, 5:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I get it now
10/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 5:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok well noted
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok I get it right
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I'm
10/10/23, 5:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok well noted
10/10/23, 5:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 6:47 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Well noted
10/10/23, 6:56 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Not questions as for now
10/10/23, 7:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 7:11 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I'm indeed
10/10/23, 7:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Ok and you too stay blessed
10/10/23, 7:18 pm - +263 71 346 3259: I'm glad to hear that
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

14/10/23, 11:02 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Thanks, same to you
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
15/10/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 407 2653: I went through but it seems expensive and above our budget
15/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 77 407 2653: May you look for other universities as well.
15/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Yes I have gone through it
15/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 346 3259: But as  I have said before the fees seems to be high for me
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please I understand that the costs might seem high to you, but let us first discuss the offer letter in detail and then you will have a better understanding of the same. Moving ahead, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?

16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier regarding the questions that I have asked. May you please go through the same and answer so that we can move ahead with our discussion.
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Esteemed Parents and Nyasha!
I trust you're all doing well.

It's been some time since our last communication. I'm excited to share that starting tomorrow at 07:00 PM CAT, we'll be initiating regular sessions. These sessions are specifically designed to address any queries, concerns, or discussions regarding the ongoing admission journey.

Your active involvement and participation in these sessions are incredibly valuable to ensure a smooth and successful process. We look forward to connecting here tomorrow at the scheduled time to discuss and plan the next steps in this exciting journey. Until then, have a pleasant evening ahead.
17/11/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.

Today's session presents an excellent opportunity for us to come together, exchange thoughts, and plan the next steps collaboratively. Your presence and input will significantly shape our path forward.

May I know if you are ready for today's discussion?
22/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Hello how are you doing
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 346 3259: I'm doing good
Ok I'm sorry for not responding quickly due to network challenges
I think it could be better if you had access to more cheaper universities that also produce good results so that we can have some form of agreement
22/11/23, 7:27 pm - +263 71 346 3259: Because the so far available University you have suggested is far beyond our reach as a family
28/11/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
28/11/23, 10:00 am - Milan Edoofa: I sincerely apologize for the delayed response. I was unexpectedly caught up in urgent work that required my immediate attention. I understand that this delay may have caused inconvenience, and I take full responsibility for it.

Now, I understand that the fee at Galgotias may seem to be very high for you, and I want to assure you that we are always looking for ways to make education affordable for our students. That's why we have shared your application with a few of our other partner universities as well, where the costs of education would comparatively be less than what it is at Galgotias. We are expecting a response from them soon, and we will let you know as soon as we have any updates. In the meantime, may I know if you are aware of how the admission process of a student is carried out?
29/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Nyasha!

29/11/23, 12:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting you to connect with me here earlier yesterday so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your admission process. 

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here now so that we can transition to the next steps in the admission journey?
29/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 346 3259: I'm available
29/11/23, 5:08 pm - +263 71 346 3259: But firstly I need clarification on the afore raised questions
30/11/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Nyasha!
I hope you are doing well today.
30/11/23, 5:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, I understand that, however, for the message that I had shared here, I was moving on to help you in understanding the same. But you went unresponsive after that, may I know why is that please?
01/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 346 3259: We think that the thing is understanding each other and then we make a procedure thereafter
