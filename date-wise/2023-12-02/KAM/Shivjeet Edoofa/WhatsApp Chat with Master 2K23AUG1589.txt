Your proactive engagement holds significant weight, and if, for any reason, either you as guardians or the student won't be available, we kindly request you to inform us beforehand.

28/08/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Master 2K23AUG1589)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
c
28/08/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Master EWYL23E0576)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits.
28/08/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session on next Monday, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups?
28/08/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am
28/08/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two Whatsapp groups. Moving forward. It's reassuring to hear that. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which she provided me with some insights into your academic background and your career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements.
28/08/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
28/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Its clear to me
28/08/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok let me do it
28/08/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, dear. I shall wait for the same.
28/08/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 723 2303: I had a great time with my counsellor Ms Tushti.She thought me more about the Earn While You Learn Program which gave me the courage to work, so I would like to share with you what really inspired me with this program. This program I have seen it as a wave destroying financial problems not for me only but for many students. Looking at the pictures of certificates of students who had succeed in getting these programmes the likes of Mandebvu Vimbikai Praise, Tapiwa Lynnette Mandongwe, Nkosilathi Kelvin Kaseke and many other students who are highly paid by this program which Ms Tushti shared with me, I can say I was greatly inspired . I see this being helpful to my parents and I, since my parents will be able to look after my siblings and stress is reduced. This program reduces many expenses for example  basic University expenses which my parents and other parents of some students can not meet at a given time. This Edoofa program does not limit students with enthusiasm to do more and this is giving us as students the exposure to big brands and companies, with this I  think Edoofa  Earn While You Learn Program is the way to make it in life. I thank Ms Tushti for for letting me see what I was not seeing.
28/08/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Absolutely, your experience with Ms. Tushti and the insights you gained from the Earn While You Learn Program sound truly transformative. It's clear that the program has left a significant impact on you and your outlook on overcoming financial challenges.

It's heartening to hear that the program has provided you with the courage to explore work opportunities while pursuing your education. The idea of the program acting as a wave to alleviate financial struggles not just for you, but for many students, is powerful.
28/08/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now moving forward, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process.

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

29/08/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

29/08/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/08/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
29/08/23, 9:55 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes they are
29/08/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.

29/08/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/08/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
29/08/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/08/23, 10:02 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am following
29/08/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/08/23, 10:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/08/23, 10:04 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes they are clear thank you
29/08/23, 10:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
29/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 723 2303: I have no queries and thoughts for now but if I come across any I will share with you
29/08/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we can
29/08/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, @263787232303 . In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

Edoofa vision is not just to get students affordable quality education and making students employable through the SEELS program. Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to success, but its also focused in making students more responsible and independent

Founders encouraged students to follow instructions so as to prepare nd be qualified for the prestigious institution.

31/08/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am good afternoon sorry network is bad this side
31/08/23, 8:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me. May I know if you would be comfortable proceeding with the session?
31/08/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am
31/08/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
31/08/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
31/08/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
31/08/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now, dear?
31/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are
31/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Forgive my network
31/08/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
31/08/23, 9:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow morning at 12:30 PM.
31/08/23, 9:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

31/08/23, 10:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is a different document, Master. The recent document is the online form for your Statement of Purpose. May I know if  you are clear on this?
31/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am no clear
31/08/23, 10:35 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Now clear
01/09/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning Mr Shivjeet I did not understand Question 1

01/09/23, 12:18 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Cavitation refers to the formation of air bubbles in fluid in low pressure condition which is lower than the saturation pressure. It is a potentially damaging condition in which the fluid in pipes or drain sewers is at high velocities. By Bernoulli’s Equation, at high flow velocities, the pressure head of fluid is reduced accordingly. The fluid pressure is less than saturation pressure, dissolved gases are released from the fluid and these air bubbles will suddenly collapse when the flow enters into a region of higher pressure.
Soil reinforcement is a way to increase the strength and stiffness of soil. It is important in reducing soil erosion at marshy land and river sides. Many buildings collapse due to foundation failure which might not have been reinforced. MIVAN construction method is much faster than the traditional beam, column and brick construction. MIVAN construction is a fast paced construction technique which offers strength and durability to a building by use of aluminium frames. It provides affordable housing for all.
Prefabricated structure means a building or subassembly that has been substantial part manufactured or assembled using closed construction. . Prefabricated structure consists of factory-made components that are transported and assembled on-site to form the complete building.
01/09/23, 12:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Master, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process.

01/09/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Tech (Civil Engineering) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
01/09/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes it's true
01/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Its correct
01/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
01/09/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
01/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
01/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
01/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
01/09/23, 9:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
01/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
01/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
01/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
01/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.
01/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
01/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Correct
01/09/23, 10:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
01/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are
01/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
01/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
01/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken a note of this example for the fee breakup?
01/09/23, 10:34 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
01/09/23, 11:04 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Noted
01/09/23, 11:51 pm - +263 77 298 1292: We are following
02/09/23, 10:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Master. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

04/09/23, 3:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Master.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further on Saturday, as an unexpected meeting came up with the team and my presence was required. 

For the missed session that was planned, I would like to schedule our session this evening at 8:30 PM CAT. Please let me know if this timing works for you?
04/09/23, 4:01 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good afternoon to you to. It will work for me
04/09/23, 4:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. We shall connect at the said hours for the continuation of our session.
04/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Thank you
04/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. May I know if you are ready to continue with your session for the admission process?
05/09/23, 8:41 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning to you. I apologise for miss the session with you yesterday. There was no electricity this side so the network will be down
05/09/23, 2:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Master.  I hope you are well and blessed. No need to apologize. I completely understand that power outages and network issues can happen. I'm here to assist you, so whenever you have a stable network and are ready to continue, just let me know, and we can proceed with your admission process.
05/09/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok thank you
05/09/23, 3:47 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Same time that you scheduled for yesterday
05/09/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very well we shall connect at the said timeframe.
05/09/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Thank you here there is network problems especially when there is no electricity
05/09/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear. Shall we proceed with the session?
06/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we can continue
06/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning my network is working if its possible we can do it now
06/09/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Master.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

For further continuation please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
06/09/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are
06/09/23, 2:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
06/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
06/09/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are aware of that
06/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/09/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 723 2303: No queries
06/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. Now, moving forward, I recently reviewed your application form once again and noted your preference to commence your EWYL journey in September 2023. Considering the date of commencement in mind, we are prepared to initiate your EWYL program in September as agreed upon.
06/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
06/09/23, 4:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session Tomorrow at 01:00 pm to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
06/09/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok will inform you
07/09/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Master,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With the positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings! I hope you're enjoying this beautiful evening. Kindly excuse me for the late reply. May I know if you are available to proceed with the session?
10/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day to you Mr Shivjeet. My parents and I were not available due to electricity fault but we believe starting tomorrow we will be attending to your sessions since the electricians had look into that problem . Thank you
11/09/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day to you Mr Shivjeet
11/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Master. Thank you for letting me know about your situation. How are you doing today?
11/09/23, 7:38 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Good evening to you too
11/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
11/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are
11/09/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
11/09/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 723 2303: No Sir. You can share with me
11/09/23, 9:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand Master, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
11/09/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes it's true
11/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
11/09/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I do
11/09/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Yes please share
11/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
11/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
12/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok
12/09/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: "Good Afternoon Parents and Master

12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
12/09/23, 2:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
12/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I have gone through them
12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
12/09/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
12/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes it is
12/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Following
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
12/09/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
12/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
12/09/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
13/09/23, 12:20 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes it is
13/09/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 776 6244: It does
13/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Master.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
13/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
13/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I shall now continue with our session.
13/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
13/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
13/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 17, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 17, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 17, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
13/09/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Following
13/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
13/09/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 723 2303: I would like to know more about it
13/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
13/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
13/09/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
13/09/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am aware
13/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
13/09/23, 8:23 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
13/09/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
13/09/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Point number 2 can you please help me on that
13/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
13/09/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Clear
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
13/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
13/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 723 2303: How long will it take to have a diploma in order to persue yo Bachelor degree
13/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The duration of a diploma program leading to a bachelor's degree varies depending on the type of course, but it typically spans five years.
13/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 723 2303: This diploma will it be of the same course I want to take with my bachelor degree
13/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Each university shares a different fee structure and yes in certain universities they might share the same cost structure. I hope you are clear on this?
13/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am now
13/09/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Clear
13/09/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
13/09/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes they are clear
13/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM. Have a great day ahead.
13/09/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Thank you so much
14/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Master. How are you doing this lovely evening?
14/09/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 723 2303: We all good thank. How are you doing today to u also?
14/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 776 6244: Good evening to you too
14/09/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you for asking. I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day.
14/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we did
14/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
15/09/23, 7:45 am - +263 78 723 2303: As I am writing my exams this year and we are expecting results and we don't know the out come but my parents and I saw that the Edoofa program will keep the 50% as they promised in helping me which is an advantage for early decision
15/09/23, 7:46 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning to you sorry for not reaching out to you yesterday
15/09/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Master.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. May I know by the word 50% that you are referring to?
15/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Referring to this Mr Shivjeet
15/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. Yes, indeed it is stated that the scholarship percentage will be 50% and it will be remained unchanged. May I know if you are clear here?
15/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am
15/09/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Name, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
15/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I did
15/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I would be pleased if you let me know how was the discussion on the Early Decision Benefits and what was your thoughts by your parents?
15/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok let me share
15/09/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 723 2303: My parents are always giving me their support especially in terms of education. We all discussed about the early benefits that the Edoofa program provides, and we all saw that these benefits are worthy and am always in the position to partake in all my goals
15/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear, dear. Now before we move forward and have a conversation regarding the same, may I know if your parents are available with us for this session and if they have any queries that you would like to ask or any concerns that have been bothering you and you would like to share?
16/09/23, 5:46 am - +263 78 723 2303: Unfortunately my parents were not available at the moment but they will join us. They were working late these days
18/09/23, 3:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parents and Master,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Weekend was good Sir
18/09/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I am available
18/09/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, may I know if your parents are connected with us?
18/09/23, 6:20 pm - +263 78 723 2303: They are not yet home Sir
18/09/23, 6:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the mean time shall we proceed with the session?
18/09/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes sir
18/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.
18/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
18/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we all on the same page
18/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
18/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
18/09/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
18/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Following
18/09/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
18/09/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Following
18/09/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 21th of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 6th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
18/09/23, 7:45 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Following
18/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
18/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your scholarship seat becomes $600. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 22nd of September, the deadline becomes the 7th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 22nd of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 7th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 7th of November, 2023).

Please let me know if we are on the same page here as well?
18/09/23, 7:48 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
18/09/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
18/09/23, 8:17 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes Sir
18/09/23, 9:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
18/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok let me share
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Admission process begin after the parents give the go ahead and the universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application for the scholarship. In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee and deadline date will be mentioned. Registration fee of $500 to $750 which is part of the first year. A period of 15days is given in order to complete registration fee
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until your parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with your admission process.

03/10/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day sir we can continue
03/10/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
03/10/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *20th October* and *20th November*.
03/10/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If your parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *20th October* and *20th November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare your application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
05/10/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 8:15 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day Sir. How are you doing
05/10/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking. May I know if your parents are connected with us?
05/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
05/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 723 2303: We are going through the messages Sir
05/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 77 298 1292: As for now we were not ready due to examination registrations. If it's possible we can start in January Sir. By that time we will be stabilizing things.
06/10/23, 12:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I appreciate your response and understanding. It's important to prioritize your current commitments, especially with examinations and registrations. As the universities are limited to an early registration process only for this month, by January, we will be required to proceed with the Standard Admission procedure, which excludes the benefits. Therefore, I would like you to please reconsider this offer and let me know as soon as possible. <This message was edited>
06/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Noted sir . Will get back to you on this next week
06/10/23, 2:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for the same.

16/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As we proceed with the session, we'll need approval from your parents for your admission process to move forward. So, may I know by when they will be back for the session?
16/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Usually they get back home around 7.00pm
16/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the information. Given that they typically arrive home around 7.00pm, could we schedule our session for at 7:30pm?
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok sir thank you
16/10/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming. We'll proceed with our session at 7:30pm
16/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok
16/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good evening sir
16/10/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear. May I know if your parents are now connected with us?

16/10/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Yes we do
16/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have given us the go-ahead to move forward with Master's university admission process, I believe you are financially confident that you will be able to manage the registration fee in due time by (*30th October* and *30th November*) and are mentally prepared for the next steps?
16/10/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Yes
16/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Master's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Master's higher education well.
16/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Ok thank you
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and Master.
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

02/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 7:59 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning Mr Shivjeet. I will talk to my parents and arrange time. Thank you so much.
03/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Master,

As it has been a while I believe that you might be able to have a conversation with your family. So, In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good evening Sir. Thank you for this opportunity but unfortunately my parents will not be available online tonight because in our area there is electricity fault but we will be able to attend to you tomorrow morning at 8.30am. I hope you will understand.
03/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your message, and I completely understand the situation. It's important that you and your parents have a stable and comfortable environment to discuss such an important matter. Tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM works perfectly, and I appreciate your understanding. We will reschedule our discussion for that time, and I look forward to our conversation then.
03/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Thank you Mr Shivjeet
03/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, Master
04/11/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
04/11/23, 9:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
04/11/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 723 2303: Hostel fee it's not part of the tuition fee right
04/11/23, 10:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's correct, the hostel fee is separate from the tuition fee. The tuition fee covers your academic expenses, while the hostel fee covers your accommodation and food expenses if you choose to stay on campus. These are separate costs, and you can choose whether to stay on-campus or find accommodation off-campus, depending on your preferences and budget.
04/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 723 2303: Which means including a three seater AC room I should have $3000
04/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 723 2303: Is this hostel fee paid at once or we can divide it
04/11/23, 10:06 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy that you have enthusiasm about the subject. Please do not worry about that. I will be sharing with you the detailed breakdown of the cost very soon so that you will have a clear understanding. So, shall we proceed further with the session?
04/11/23, 10:09 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok sir thank you
04/11/23, 10:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
04/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
04/11/23, 11:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
04/11/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes
04/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
04/11/23, 12:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
04/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are together
04/11/23, 12:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works? <This message was edited>
04/11/23, 1:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are still connected with us and available for this session so that we can proceed with the session and hopefully complete our discussion in due time. @263787232303

Avail on early decision grant of $150 dollars which means from the $750 that I was supposed to pay I will pay $600. 3. Preserve my university fee
06/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 723 2303: If I don't achieve a minimum of 2 passes I will be asked to switch to a diploma
06/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct, dear. Indeed, there is nothing to correct here. It really shows your genuine concentration in our sessions, and I am very impressed by it.
06/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
06/11/23, 8:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
06/11/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes Sir this is now clear
06/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
06/11/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we are in Harare
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
06/11/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
06/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok sir thank you definitely my parents will get in touch with him
06/11/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
06/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
06/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok Sir
06/11/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333038009240398
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
06/11/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve the details.
06/11/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Received
06/11/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right Master, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $2000
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $2000 + $200 + $800 = $3000
06/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Sir on point 1 isn't it $1000 with scholarship
06/11/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. With the scholarship, your semester tuition fee turns out to be $1,000, and there are two semesters in a year, which results in $2,000 per annum. May I know if you are clear with me?
06/11/23, 9:30 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Now clear sir
06/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $3000, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
06/11/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
06/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
06/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I have
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
06/11/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
06/11/23, 9:41 pm - +263 78 723 2303: So this $1800 can be paid bit by bit right
06/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Indeed that is correct. It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
06/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
06/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 723 2303: For now i dont have any quiries but if I come up with some I will share
06/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds great! I'm pleased to know that your questions have been addressed, and I appreciate your active participation in our conversation. Please don't hesitate to reach out at any time if you have more questions or need further information in the future.
06/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
06/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India.

06/11/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.

06/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome, Master, before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
06/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
06/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on this Wednesday. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
06/11/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes it sounds good thank you sir
06/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You're very welcome! I'm delighted to hear that our plan aligns with your expectations.

08/11/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Dear Parents and Master, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

On that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the offr letter discussion. 

Shall we begin?
08/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good evening Sir
08/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hello, Master! I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Galgotias University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
08/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes we did sir
08/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
08/11/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok thank you Sir. My parents were so excited since it is a dream come true for me to have this great opportunity to study abroad. They are now looking forward on the payments
08/11/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 723 2303: This registration fee is the one used for processing the Visa right
08/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, the VISA fee is not included, and it's an additional cost that you need to submit to the embassy in person because it requires biometric scanning to process. Can you confirm if this is clear to you?
08/11/23, 8:31 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok clear now
08/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
08/11/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Because of bad network I couldn't not manage to search about it but I will look forward to it this weekend
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries about the network issues, and I appreciate your proactive approach to conducting further research about the university.  As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India. Feel free to reach out to them for a more comprehensive understanding of the program's benefits and outcomes.
08/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Valerie.vcf (file attached)
08/11/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Thank you Sir
08/11/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of November 16, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
08/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Paying first installment of $300
08/11/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
08/11/23, 9:08 pm - +263 78 723 2303: I will let you know by Monday I guess my parents will have an idea
08/11/23, 9:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That sounds like a reasonable plan. It's good to discuss it with your parents and decide on the most suitable date and mode of payment. Whenever you have the details, please feel free to share them with me, and we'll ensure the payment process goes smoothly.
09/11/23, 5:29 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok thank you
14/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

14/11/23, 5:05 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Yes I did and they are working on it
14/11/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. So, may I know if they might be able to make the payment for the first part of the registration fee on or before the 16th of November so that I can relay the same information to the university as well?
14/11/23, 5:11 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok when my parents come back from work they will give me feedback
14/11/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know the time that they might be back from work, dear? <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I was hoping to get a response from your end regarding your discussion for the offer letter and the update on the payment details, as the deadline is tomorrow. As our admission officer, I wouldn't want you to have any delays on the letter, which may lead to the revocation of the letter. So, if you are available now, may I know if there is any update on the payment regarding the first part of your university registration fees?
15/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day sir yesterday we had bad network but I am hoping my parents will do something by the end of the day like what they said to me
15/11/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.

I understand that technical issues can sometimes cause delays. I appreciate your efforts in keeping me informed. I would also like to let you know that tomorrow marks the deadline of your first part of your university registration fees for your prestigious offer letter from Galgotias University.

Hence, I wanted to inquire about your preparation for the payment, and as your admission officer, I do not want any potential discrepancies that may lead to losing out on this offer letter. May I kindly ask how your father is managing the finances?
16/11/23, 7:09 am - +263 77 298 1292: Good morning sir , my apologies , we have had a challenge one of my son's , the youngest is not well.

18/11/23, 9:13 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Master!

I hope this message finds you well. I had been expecting to hear back from you, but it seems my previous messages may have been missed, causing a delay in the offer letter. Are you currently facing any challenges that are affecting our communication?
18/11/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good morning Sir. We are sorry for the late replay. My parents did not find time to be online the previous day since they were attending some family meetings.

I truly appreciate your patience during this challenging time. Your family's well-being is of utmost importance, and we completely understand the need to prioritize these crucial matters. In light of this, could you kindly share the medical reports with me?

I have a family member who is a medical director and a doctor in my country who is My Father, and they have access to advanced medical technologies. This could expedite the diagnosis process and ensure a swift response. <This message was edited>

If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
22/11/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Good day to you Sir. There is no electricity here which is leading to bad network

24/11/23, 10:43 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I would like to inform you that I had a meeting with the academic board regarding the challenges you are currently facing. I would appreciate a brief discussion with you. If you are available, please let me know so that we can have a detailed conversation.
24/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 78 723 2303: Good day to you Sir
24/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok Sir thank you on behalf of my parents I will take part in this discussion when they find time they will be reaching out
24/11/23, 11:19 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to hear about your father's willingness to make the full payment by the second deadline. However, due to the university's strict regulations, that might not be feasible. Still, considering the reserved scholarship seats, we could potentially arrange for a delayed payment before the end of this month. The reason being that the endowment benefits come with a validity, and you would be paying the full cost of $750 for registration fees. So, in order to help you out with this, could you provide details on how much your father will be able to gather for your university registration fees?
24/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 723 2303: Ok thank  you Sir. From the message my father sent to you saying that he was going to arrange the the total amount of $600 by the the 28th of December through the music festivals that he will be participating
24/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 78 723 2303: I don't know if I am clear on that Sir
24/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 723 2303: We do understand the stricts of the university, so can you help us what we can do. Because paying that fee of the 28th of December was the plan my father had
24/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, Master, and thank you for providing me with clarity again on the planned payment of $600 by the 28th of December through the music festivals. Your father's commitment is appreciated.

However, as mentioned earlier, the university has strict regulations regarding the payment deadlines and the validity of endowment benefits. While I understand that your father is making efforts to gather the required amount. As your admission officer, I'm here to assist you. I'm willing to discuss this with the university officials regarding an extension. However, as the scholarship opportunities are also limited and many international students are applying, making the total payment in the next month would not be feasible. Nevertheless, I'd like to inquire about the amount you can gather by the end of this month, specifically by the 30th of November. If you could provide me with this information, it would help me assure the university officials that you're committed to payment and help you retain this offer letter. Can you please share these details with me?
24/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Ok I will get back to you when my parents are back
24/11/23, 6:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. May I know by when they might be back for the reply to this?
24/11/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 723 2303: Tomorrow I will have your response
25/11/23, 8:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Master!

How are you doing this lovely weekend? <This message was edited>
25/11/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 723 2303: Morning Sir. I told my father he will get back to you on Monday
25/11/23, 10:58 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if your father is facing any challenges at the moment?
25/11/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Good afternoon , I think my challenge was the unexpected illness of my younger son. Otherwise besides that I am capable . It's unfortunate  my son's illness came at a time when I was preparing for the deadlines. Reason we asked for an extension.  I asked Sasha to respond to the other question .I had said I would respond to the question on Monday .  Maybe I can give you my brief cv. I am a professional musician and music tutor. We have a small Hydraulic seal manufacturing concern , you can check our Facebook page , Sealflex seals. I understand your concern . I don't know if this answers you well.  You cam also try and google my name and know much about me ,sir .Master Pablo Nakappa
25/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your current situation and providing insight into your background. I appreciate your openness and understanding regarding the unexpected illness of your younger son, which understandably took precedence over other commitments. I hope your son is on the path to recovery now.

I took a moment to look into your professional endeavors, including your music career and Sealflex seals on Facebook. Your accomplishments are truly impressive, and it's evident that you bring a wealth of expertise to various fields.

I completely understand the challenges that arose due to these unforeseen circumstances. The university's deadlines can be stringent, but I'm here to assist you in navigating this situation.
25/11/23, 2:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Considering your commitment to resolving the payment matter and your notable professional background, I'll proceed to engage with the university officials to discuss a potential extension given the circumstances surrounding your son's health. However, it's important to keep the lines of communication open to ensure the best possible outcome. 

However, as the scholarship opportunities are also limited and many international students are applying, making the total payment in the next month would not be feasible. Nevertheless, I'd like to inquire about the amount you can gather by the end of this month, specifically by the 30th of November as the university will be closing the round of applications by then and you will end up losing out on the letter. If you could provide me with this information, it would help me assure the university officials that you're committed to payment and help you retain this offer letter. Can you please share these details with me?
25/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 298 1292: If I can pay at least $300 by the 30th will that be ok
25/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed that would be feasible. I'll communicate your request for an extension to the university administration by the 30th of November. After that, I would like you to know that the university will be closing the round of applications for this month.
25/11/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, on that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Mr. Shivjeet about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $300 before 30th November 2023 and $300 by 28th December 2023.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
25/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Noted with thanks
28/11/23, 1:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

As per our cent conversation. May I know if you were able to to share the email to the academic bard?

28/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Thank you sir
28/11/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 298 1292: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 5:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing with me the update. The academic board will be responding to you very shortly.
29/11/23, 11:23 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good morning parents and Master!

I hope you are having a fine morning today and your family is doing well. I would like to inform you that your request for an extension of the deadline has been approved by the academic board and may already have been reflected in your inbox.

In addition, I would like to gently remind you again today about your first payment of your university registration fee for tomorrow. The reason for this reminder today is that I will be having a meeting with the university officials today regarding the performance and the closing of this academic month. Therefore, it would be very helpful for me to give them an estimate of the payments expected to arrive before the end of this month.

Hence, could you please provide me with an update on your current preparations for tomorrow's payment?
29/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 298 1292: Confirm that this payment will be done through Mr Rajan
29/11/23, 12:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. I shall confirm the mode of payment to the university official and the account team today.
30/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Master. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

I wanted to reach out with regard to our previous conversation as you were to make a deposit of the first part of Master's registration fee today so I would like to know how is your preparation going and if you have any updates to share with us?
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the payment of your fee by now?
01/12/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Master!

Over the past couple of days I was hoping for a response from your end regarding the update on your first part of your tuition fees. However it seems that all my efforts are in vain. 

As per our last conversation you had decided to make the payment by 30th of November. Also I did recall that in the mon of August you were excited and happy for your higher education and hence I believe you continued with the program. As you admission officer I am still here to help you out on the same. Hence if you are able to see my message could you please share me an update regarding the same ?
