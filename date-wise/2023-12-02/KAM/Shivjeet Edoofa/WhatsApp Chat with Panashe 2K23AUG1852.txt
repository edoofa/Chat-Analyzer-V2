14/09/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Panashe.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further yesterday, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
14/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 070 9740: We can proceed
14/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/09/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
14/09/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes they are clear
14/09/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/09/23, 3:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/09/23, 3:16 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes sir it is clear
14/09/23, 3:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/09/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 070 9740: How long should I take to pay registration fee
14/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended and I was occupied with a meeting. You will be provided a timeframe of two weeks for most of the universities and the deadline for the offer letter is depended on the universities as well.
15/09/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Panashe. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
16/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Sir sorry not being available

29/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes I'm ready
29/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/09/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

06/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Ok, on first video it is all about that students should be able to think widely and they must be teachable so that they can be successful. Also, it gives encourage students to follow instructions as given this will help to reduce mistakes and problems
06/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 070 9740: The second video tells us that the Edoofa does not only make students employable but it also equips students with knowledge and skills such that they can be able to do their things independently
07/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Good evening, the video is high lighting about how do the Edoofa founders help us to be in colleges or universities that we can get good quality education and what makes students more employable.
07/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 070 9740: The last video is telling the importance of the Statement of Purpose. It tells that the statement of purpose helps to convince the Edoofa board as well as school where us students might want to be enrolled.
07/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Sorry for not being available, l have been busy preparing for my exams which are around the corner
08/10/23, 8:18 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Hello
09/10/23, 8:00 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Panashe. 

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. It was the weekend, and my available hours end a bit early.

With that being said, I will be connecting with you this evening at 5:00 PM for further continuation of our session.
09/10/23, 5:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and My dear student. 

I trust you had a restful weekend with your family. May I kindly inquire if you are presently available to continue with our session?
10/10/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and My dear student, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

I was not able to connect with you yesterday as our available hours have ended. If you are ready. Shall we begin?
10/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we can begin
10/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
10/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
10/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
10/10/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
10/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we are on the same page
10/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
10/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
10/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

10/10/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
10/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 5:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
12/10/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Panashe!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
13/10/23, 7:35 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Economics is a social science that deals with the allocation of scarce resources, hence it can be categorized into two microeconomics and macroeconomics.

Microeconomics is the branch of Economics that deals with the behavior of individuals, firms and households in decision making about how best to allocate scarce resources, examples of microeconomics factors are demand and supply whilst macroeconomics is the study of an economy as a whole, it deals with various issues which includes national income, distribution, general price level and money.

Demand is the quantity of goods and services that consumers are prepared to buy at a given price over a given period of time. The law of demand states that as price decreases quantity demanded increases, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, as price increases quantity demanded decreases, holding all other things constant. Demand forecasting refers to the process of predicting the quantity of goods that will be demanded by consumers or customers in the future . Taking for instance if a company sold 200,250,300 units of a good in the month of March, April and May respectively,the firm can estimate the quantity of goods that can be demanded in the following month of month of June if the market conditions remains the same.

In addition, outsourcing can affect the economy positively or negatively. On the positive side outsourcing may help firms have increased profits which in turn creates more employment.For example if a company outsource to a country which has lower labor costs it will be able to maximize the revenue. However, outsourcing is not always beneficial because to some extent it can lead to local job losses.

Exchange rate refers to the price of one currency in terms of another currency. Currency exchange rate is determined by the market forces of demand and supply for foreign exchange. It can also be caused by the relative purchasing powers of two currencies for example US dollar and the Euro.

13/10/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Am really sorry l was not feeling well sir
13/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I am sorry to hear that, dear. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
13/10/23, 8:14 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l am available we can proceed
13/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 78 070 9740: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

13/10/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 070 9740: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is B.Sc (Economics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
13/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes everything is correct on about that
13/10/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
13/10/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l am ready
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
13/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
13/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l do understand that
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
13/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
13/10/23, 10:23 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l am aware of that he told me
13/10/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, I will be closing our session for now and let us connect tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM. Have a great day ahead!
13/10/23, 10:37 pm - +263 78 070 9740: You too have a blessed day ahead
14/10/23, 8:01 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, Dear parents and Panashe. 

How are you doing this lovely weekend?
14/10/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Good evening, we are doing great how about you
16/10/23, 3:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I'm available sir we can continue
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
16/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we are on the same page
16/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
16/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
16/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
16/10/23, 5:27 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yeah I'm aware of that
16/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
16/10/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
16/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Ok ok I'm aware of all that
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?

19/10/23, 3:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we would be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 27th of October. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 27th of October so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. May I know by when you might be available for that?

Please excuse me for the late reply I was occupied with a meeting. I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. With that said the form was the EWYL form that was shared with you at our initial interaction. May I know if you remember?
20/10/23, 7:57 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I don't remember sir
20/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear. I am now sharing you with the fresh form.
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to recieve this form?
20/10/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I have received the form sir
20/10/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. So, may I know if you might be able to fill out the form by tomorrow at 12:00 PM?
20/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 070 9740: This message was deleted
20/10/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l will be done by 12:00 PM tomorrow
20/10/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In the meantime, shall we proceed with the session for the admission process?
20/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we can continue
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
20/10/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I am happy to see that and l wish to be like them
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
20/10/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I am ready sir
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
20/10/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
20/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I'm done
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 070 9740: That's awesome.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we are on the same page sir
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
20/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
20/10/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I'm clear with it sir
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
20/10/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
20/10/23, 9:57 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I'm understanding sir
20/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
21/10/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 070 9740: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 11:50 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have gone through the form and noticed that you have written 6 - 20 as the orientation date, but as discussed, it was supposed to be the 27th of October. May I know if you are now clear on this matter?
21/10/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 070 9740: I think for now l am a bit busy sir you know exams need more attention
21/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect your exams, which are scheduled to begin on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, you can enhance your study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit your performance in the upcoming exams.
21/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and your exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled, that parents can actively participate in.
21/10/23, 11:55 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. hence, if Abdul is occupied with school, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program
21/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 070 9740: Ok on that case l will start the program
21/10/23, 12:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I y when you might be able to enter the correct date and share it with me?
21/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Maybe today or tomorrow
21/10/23, 12:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if the document is with you now, dear?
21/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes it is with me now
21/10/23, 1:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Then may I know if you are facing any challenges in simply correcting the date and sending it to me?
21/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I will do it when I'm home at around 8:00 PM
22/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 78 070 9740: <Media omitted>
23/10/23, 6:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I was unable to continue our conversation when you were online, as it was the weekend and I was not available at that time

For further continuation, I will be available from 3:00 PM this evening to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, and we can do that too. I appreciate your understanding and please do enjoy your day.
23/10/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Panashe!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?
25/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 070 9740: I think 7:30 PM is good sir
25/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Very wel, we shall connect at the said time frame.
25/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. 

How are you doing this lovely evening?
26/10/23, 5:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you've had a great day. It appears I didn't receive a response from you, and it seems my previous message went unanswered. Nonetheless, I am fully prepared to initiate our session. I would like you to participate more actively in our session because there are certain benefits that I would be happy to provide you with more insights on, so you don't miss out on these opportunities. If you're ready to start now, let's make the most of this opportunity and have a productive session.
26/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Good evening, am sorry for not being available we are having a challenge on electricity
26/10/23, 8:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No problem at all. I understand that electricity can be a challenge sometimes. If you are comfortable now, shall we procceed with the session?
26/10/23, 8:13 pm - +263 78 070 9740: We can proceed now I'm comfortable
26/10/23, 8:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 070 9740: It would be great if you help me by giving more information
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/10/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Thanks for giving light
26/10/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes those will be the only options
26/10/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 8:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l am clear with this
26/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
27/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Ok l will do that if l start my program
27/10/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope you are doing well as we approach a fresh new weekend. I would like to inform you that I will be unable to continue our conversation, as we are approaching the weekend, and we are limited by our time.

For further continuation with sufficient time and productivity, I will be available from 3:00 PM on the coming Monday, which is the 30th of October, to continue our session. Please let me know in advance whether you would prefer your session in the evening from 7:30 PM onwards, as we can do that too. Thank you for your understanding, and please do enjoy your weekend. <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 2:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Panashe.

I trust you are enjoying good health and that this new weekend brings blessings and a swift end to any lingering Monday blues.

I'm pleased to inform you that I am currently active and fully prepared to engage in your session. Furthermore, I want to make you aware that I will also be accessible in the evening, starting from 7:00 PM, in case you happen to be occupied at this moment. If you are ready to proceed now, kindly let me know so that we can initiate the session.
30/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Ok l will be available
01/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Sorry for not being available yesterday
02/11/23, 12:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Panashe.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as I was on a leave on account of my birthday. It is alright.

That said, I'm now active and ready to take on your session. I would also like to inform you that I will be available in the evening as well, from 5:00 PM, in case you are currently occupied. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
06/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Good evening, if you are available l think we can proceed with our session
06/11/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 8:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

06/11/23, 8:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

I trust this message finds you well. I've been eagerly anticipating your response, as we have yet to finalize our discussion regarding the university's letter. I understand that there may be circumstances that have prevented you from being available recently, and I want to convey the importance of this conversation.

Given that the letter comes with a specified deadline, a timely discussion is crucial to ensure your comprehensive understanding of its contents and to avoid getting revoked by the university so that you will not lose out on this opportunity. Hence, I kindly urge you to prioritize this matter so we can proceed efficiently.
20/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Sorry for not being available
20/11/23, 5:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, may I know if you are ready to proceed with the session now?

20/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes l went through it
20/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
20/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion.

20/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we can move forward
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
20/11/23, 5:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
20/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Tuition fee after scholarship is $900 , standard duration of course is 3 years, admission and procedure fee is $300  and registration fee is of $750
20/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
20/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, as much as I would like to continue with the session, my available hours are ending soon. Let's connect tomorrow from 12:30 PM onwards. Please ensure to come online so that we can discuss this offer letter and conclude it in time, ensuring you don't miss out on the offer. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afreroon dear parents and Panashe !

I hope you are doing well and blessed. During the past couple of days, in our discussion of the offer letter, it has been noticed that there have been irregularities in our sessions, leading to a delay in discussing your offer letter.

23/11/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
25/11/23, 8:25 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning dear parents and Panashe!

I hope you are doing well today. Allow me to share a tale - a student, much like yourself, embarking on a journey toward higher education abroad. Amidst the bustling days and nights, a pivotal document, the offer letter, stands as the gateway to this dream.

In earnest dedication, I've set aside extra hours this weekend, akin to an adventurer preparing diligently for an expedition, to ensure our conversation reaches its conclusion. Picture this discussion as a treasure map guiding you toward understanding the intricacies of your financial readiness. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So shall we proceed?
25/11/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 070 9740: Yes we can proceed
25/11/23, 9:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
25/11/23, 9:11 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
25/11/23, 9:12 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
25/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 070 9740: Quite understandable
25/11/23, 9:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
25/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 070 9740: Yeah l think it's so good for students to choose the best accomodation
25/11/23, 9:29 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes Indeed. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
25/11/23, 9:36 am - +263 78 070 9740: That's clear l am all good with it
25/11/23, 9:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
25/11/23, 9:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
25/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 070 9740: Yeah we are together on that
25/11/23, 9:46 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
25/11/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 070 9740: Yes your  explanation would help me
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
25/11/23, 10:21 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
25/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 070 9740: Thanks now we are on same page
25/11/23, 10:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/11/23, 10:24 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/11/23, 10:25 am - +263 78 070 9740: No l am from Karoi
25/11/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
25/11/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
25/11/23, 10:27 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
25/11/23, 10:30 am - +263 78 070 9740: Ok l will contact him
25/11/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
25/11/23, 10:31 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
25/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 070 9740: No thanks l still have Mr Shorwi details that l used last time
25/11/23, 10:57 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that the details have been updated. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
25/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Thanks
25/11/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
25/11/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Ok I'm aware of all the costs
25/11/23, 1:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
25/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
25/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
25/11/23, 1:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Panashe!

I hope you are doing well today. I was hoping for a response from your side the previous day so that we can complete our discussion for the offer letter details. My sole aim in this quest is not just to secure the offer letter but to ensure a sturdy foundation for your aspirations, carving a path for a brighter future abroad. Your dreams are the compass; let's steer them toward reality together. So if you are ready shall we proceed?
30/11/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I wanted to reach out to you to get an update on the admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by Tomorrow, 1st December 2023. 

As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the preparation of the payment of your fee?
01/12/23, 7:25 am - +263 78 070 9740: We are still preparing for the payment
01/12/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Panashe. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Thank you for keeping me updated. Could you please let me know of your current preparations?
01/12/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 070 9740: Okay we will try to do it fast if things go well, sorry
01/12/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Please excuse me for the late reply I was on a short break. Could you please let me know of your preparations?
