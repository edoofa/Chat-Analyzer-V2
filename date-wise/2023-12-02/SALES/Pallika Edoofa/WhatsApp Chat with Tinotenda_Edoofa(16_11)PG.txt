20/11/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 2:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 



The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
           
*I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?*
20/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK thank you very much ,I will appreciate then
20/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK no problem so I don't know if it is for real
20/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK that's wonderful I understand  ,so for now um the only student who applied Edoofa scholarship?
20/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 018 2633: So how many points would you look for a student in Edoofa Scholarship
20/11/23, 3:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
20/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK thank you so. Much so  for  now are you still have students are still  learning in India University
20/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK thank you according to myself I will work very hard I promise I will get great results ,more than 6 points
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!

Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.

27/11/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this

27/11/23, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Tinotenda, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
27/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Thanks ma'am,no ma'am um not
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
27/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am this is so fantastic
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am so if I finish up my university studies over there,and if I will get job will I turn back the money to Edoofa scholarship or
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Please let me know which money are you referring to?
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 018 2633: University fees
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 018 2633: No mom my family can't afford it
27/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Um not understand well ma'am If I pass my studies well who will pay my University money
27/11/23, 2:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will they be able to manage the remaining expenses?
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 78 018 2633: So which means the other 50% will going to pay by my family I don't know if I hear well
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Tinotenda
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK thank you I heard you
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, will they be able to manage?
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 018 2633: I don't know God ma'am if the time comes but for now $1,500 is too much to my family
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Will see what we will do when time come
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know where you have read 1500$? <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 018 2633: This one maybe I failed to understand  ma'am
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 018 2633: How much is family will going to pay
27/11/23, 3:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, By this, I meant if a student qualifies in the program, the yearly fee can be around $1500-$2300 after the Edoofa Scholarship. Plus, we offer a chance for students to further cut down their remaining fees through our Earn While You Learn Program
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 018 2633: So the fees will paid after I finish Edoofa scholarship
27/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 018 2633: So I will pay after I learn my course and then Edoofa will pay for me during my course
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tinotenda, Let me help you to understand this clearly, following today's counseling session, you will move on to step 2, which involves an eligibility test and interview. If you qualify for the program, you'll be required to pay the one-time enrollment fee. Subsequently, the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) process will commence, allowing you to earn scholarship credits, approximately ranging from 50-100$ per month, even before you come to India. These credits will contribute towards reducing your tuition fees.
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am thank you
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: You're welcome Tinotenda
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
28/11/23, 12:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 7:42 am - +263 78 018 2633: Good morning ma'am thank you
28/11/23, 7:44 am - +263 78 018 2633: OK .ma'am thank  u I understand
28/11/23, 7:45 am - +263 78 018 2633: No I don't know how can it be done
28/11/23, 12:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

Are we good to begin today's session?
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Yes ma'am how are you doing
28/11/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great, Thank you for asking!!
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 1:21 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
28/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 78 018 2633: You are welcome maam

28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Welcome Back, Tinotenda!!
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
28/11/23, 6:04 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am thank you now I understand better
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!
28/11/23, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
28/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Thank you maam

30/11/23, 10:29 pm - +263 78 240 4161: Fine and you.l'm really sorry about that day I embarrasse l thought you are a criminal sorry please forgive me
01/12/23, 1:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Are you ready for the same?
01/12/23, 1:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I can understand that mam, That is a genuine concern and being a parent, it is very important to research and understand the program well to proceed with satisfaction.
01/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Yes ma'am how are you
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing great, Thank you for asking
01/12/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
01/12/23, 1:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
01/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Thank you too and you are welcome maam
01/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Yes ma'am that's my wish
01/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 018 2633: It is ma'am the whole information of the person who need to study abroad
01/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
01/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
01/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 1:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK maam
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid.
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Waal that's great maam
01/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 018 2633: Yes explain

01/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 018 2633: For now I didn't not apply for many of your universities so what do I do
01/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am I understand thank you
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!!
01/12/23, 2:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 018 2633: We did all 6 ma'am
01/12/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/12/23, 5:18 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am thank for help yes we can start
01/12/23, 5:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Silenkosi, *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
01/12/23, 5:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
01/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK ma'am I understand in Augugust I will pay $500
01/12/23, 6:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great!!
01/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 018 2633: So about the Visa  is there any money I will pay
01/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 018 2633: OK thank you maam
01/12/23, 6:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, then, Tinotenda, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
