23/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 71 675 3104: From what I understand, Edoofa is a database of scholarships and other financial aid opportunities. Students can create a profile on the platform and search for scholarships that match their qualifications and interests. They can also be notified of new scholarship opportunities through the platform. I think the best thing about Edoofa is that it makes it easy for students to find and apply for scholarships, which can be a time-consuming process.

23/11/23, 4:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*


Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
23/11/23, 5:20 pm - +263 71 675 3104: This message was deleted
23/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 675 3104: While I am not aware of the exact cost of a comparable quality higher education for an international student in India, I know that it would be significantly more expensive than pursuing the same degree in other countries. In fact, tuition costs in India are often more than half of what they are in many other countries. Additionally, the cost of living in India is generally better than in other countries. Overall, I believe that studying in India would be a cost-effective option for pursuing a high-quality education.
23/11/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
23/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Yes may I know how it's done
23/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
23/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
23/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
23/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

23/11/23, 6:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 6:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
23/11/23, 6:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
23/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Yes I think it'd helpful
23/11/23, 6:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
23/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 71 675 3104: I understand and that's a great idea
23/11/23, 6:29 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
23/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Number 3
23/11/23, 6:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Earn While You Learn*
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn. <This message was edited>

23/11/23, 6:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Approximately how much will be remaining a year if I were to earn 75 a month?
23/11/23, 6:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, Please elaborate your query.
23/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Am sorry I now understand what you meant
23/11/23, 6:38 pm - +263 71 675 3104: My father
23/11/23, 6:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Tadiwanashe
23/11/23, 6:39 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
23/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 675 3104: My family is very supportive of my desire to study abroad, and they are especially enthusiastic about the idea of me studying in India. They believe that this would be a life-changing experience for me, and they are excited about the opportunity for me to explore a new culture and experience a different way of life. In addition, they are confident that the exposure to India's diverse and rapidly developing economy will provide me with many new opportunities for my future. Overall, my family is thrilled about the prospect of me studying abroad in India.
23/11/23, 6:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, It's wonderful to hear about your family's strong support and enthusiasm for your decision to study abroad in India. Their belief in the life-changing experiences, cultural exploration, and diverse opportunities aligns well with the exciting journey ahead <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
23/11/23, 6:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
23/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Yes it is
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 6:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?

27/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 77 342 6118: Yes

27/11/23, 5:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, I hope that you also have gone through the above information so, Please let me explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid
27/11/23, 5:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
27/11/23, 5:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 342 6118: Major challenge when you have some in University,primary and secondary children
27/11/23, 5:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please elaborate on your query, Mr. Tsindi.
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 342 6118: I said I can't afford anything
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 342 6118: Overloaded
27/11/23, 5:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsindi, As Tadiwanashe has mentioned that you will be helping her to study abroad, Also. Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on the tuition fees and based on the performance and evaluations of our Academic Board, one can even achieve a higher quantum of the scholarship but the remaining cost after the scholarship such as Living and Transportation is catered by a student's family.  I will be guiding you through the financial aspects of the program.

Will you be able to manage the remaining expenses?
27/11/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 342 6118: What amount and how  and when payable
27/11/23, 5:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please go through this information
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 342 6118: I did,I earn USD 200 for the upkeep of 5 children,school fees and everything
27/11/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 342 6118: Unless it is preparing for end of year 2024
27/11/23, 5:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Tsindi, Please note that it is a one time investment once Tadiwanashe is found eligible for the program. Once he qualify and enroll, he'll kickstart the process of earning valuable scholarship credits. These credits, averaging around 50-100$ per month, provide a significant opportunity for him to independently finance your higher education before him embark on his journey to India. It's an investment that pays off in more ways than one.
27/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 77 342 6118: He is doing Form 5, when do you want him to start and what level
27/11/23, 6:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr Tsindi, please note that we have successfully opened the 2024 and 2025 intake and you can reserve the seat for Tadiwanashe and once he found eligible, he will start right away after getting enrolled
27/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 342 6118: All being good
27/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 342 6118: But money challenges
27/11/23, 8:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mr. Tsindi, I can understand the money challenges, but can you arrange the money in installments
28/11/23, 12:11 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

28/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 342 6118: Fine thanks
28/11/23, 2:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, are you willing to pursue it now, Mr. Tsindi?

28/11/23, 2:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Will you be able to manage this amount which will be as one time investment? <This message was edited>

29/11/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 675 3104: Do you offer fully funded scholarships?
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, 
Please note that Edoofa is a partially funded scholarship program! 

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship

In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's recommended that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
