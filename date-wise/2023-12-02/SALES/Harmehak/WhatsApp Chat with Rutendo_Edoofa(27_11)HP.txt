We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe.

27/11/23, 4:43 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
01/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Yess please
01/12/23, 1:39 pm - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?

01/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Noted please
01/12/23, 1:43 pm - Harmehak: Rutendo, I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
01/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 940 1284: I am confident
01/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Rutendo
01/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Agriculture Economics?
01/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Unfortunately i left my documents at school
01/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 940 1284: My A level subject combination is Geography, Economics and Business studies

01/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 940 1284: No i changed my phone

01/12/23, 4:13 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Ruteno.

01/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 71 940 1284: 5 O levels including English and maths with a B ...and two A levels
01/12/23, 4:29 pm - Harmehak: Considering your interest in Agricultural Economics and Development, have you explored if anyone in your family has pursued this course or a related field? Additionally, envisioning your future, what specific career paths do you see yourself exploring upon completion of this course, especially in terms of job opportunities?
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Not anyone has persued this course
01/12/23, 4:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright, you can address other questions
01/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Marketing agent representative
01/12/23, 4:52 pm - Harmehak: In that case, don't you believe Bachelor in Business administration would be a better choice for you?
01/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Maybe, I'll think about that
01/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: Sure,

Meanwhile I would like to ask why you didn't pursue Biology or Crop Science in your A level?
01/12/23, 5:48 pm - +263 71 940 1284: I have a weakness in those areas
01/12/23, 5:55 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

So I would like to add that both Agriculture and Economics are two different fields.

Now considering your subject combination and interests, you can pursue the following:

Bachelor of commerce
Bachelor in Business Administration
Bachelor in Economics
01/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 940 1284: Ohh okay thank you sir
01/12/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: I am Ms Harmehak, Rutendo.
01/12/23, 9:45 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 PM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
