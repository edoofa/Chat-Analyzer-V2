17/10/23, 9:09 pm - +234 704 111 6704: As stated earlier,  my name is OLALEYE OLUWABUKOLA ESTHER and I am excited to have this opportunity. I am a highly motivated and results-driven person with my background in Crop production.
I hold a Bachelor of Agriculture in Crop production from the Ekiti State University in Nigeria, where I gained a deep understanding of agricultural systems. This comprehensive program provided me with a strong foundation in plant science, agronomy, pest management, and crop development. It not only equipped me with theoretical knowledge but also allowed me to gain practical experience in various aspects of agriculture. This degree has fostered my passion for sustainable farming practices and the crucial role they play in ensuring food security and environmental stewardship.
However, I am currently running a masters of statistics and data analysis which I am rounding up in march 2024.
My career aspiration is to be a catalyst for change in the field of agricultural sustainability and food security in Nigeria. I am committed to fostering environmentally friendly farming practices, reducing food waste, and ensuring equitable access to nutritious food worldwide. Through education, research, and collaboration, I aim to make a lasting impact on the global food systems, contributing to a more sustainable and food-secure future.
I enjoy Researching, farming, solving mathematical problems, Travelling, listening to music, Reading and Interacting with people.
I am the first child from a family of four.
My dad is a research scientist (food scientist) and my mum , a teacher.
