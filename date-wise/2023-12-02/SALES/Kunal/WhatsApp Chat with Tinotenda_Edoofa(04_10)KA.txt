How are you doing?
11/10/23, 4:59 pm - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

01/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 086 3673: <Media omitted>

Physics 
Chemistry 
English Communication Skills
01/12/23, 5:51 pm - Kunal: Well noted
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
01/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 086 3673: Yaa definitely I have no doubt
01/12/23, 5:53 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
01/12/23, 5:53 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having Biology at A level, you are not qualified for Medicine. But let me tell you, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, there are courses aligned to Medical Field itself for which you are eligible and can fulfill your dreams to work in this sector, such as 

**Bachelor of Pharmacy*

*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

*Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering*, etc. 

Would you like me to explain any of these courses to you? <This message was edited>
01/12/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 086 3673: I will have to consult first then
01/12/23, 6:11 pm - Kunal: Alright Tinotenda
May I know by when you can give me the feedback?
01/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 086 3673: Okay by tomorrow around 1200 if you are patient enough
01/12/23, 6:31 pm - Kunal: That would be fine
