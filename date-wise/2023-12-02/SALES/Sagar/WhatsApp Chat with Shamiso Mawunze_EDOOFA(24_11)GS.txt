29/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Shamiso,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
29/11/23, 3:25 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Okay Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 3:29 pm - Sagar: Alright, so Shamiso, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Leane, is that correct?
29/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Yes Leane helped me to know about the Edoofa program
29/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Leane, also do tell me whether you learnt about Leane’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Leane just told me about how education is the key and how important is to further my studies to a certain level.l have not asked Leane about his/her experience with the Edoofa program
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: Noted.
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the program.
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Okay Mr Gurvinder
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
29/11/23, 3:43 pm - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Yes l'm really looking forward to this program .l just want to like those students .To become independent
29/11/23, 3:53 pm - Sagar: Okay so Shamiso, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 515 6353: Yes l do have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sagar: Alright so Shamiso, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*

29/11/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 515 6353: What motivated me to this field of study is how l noticed the sufferings of a girl child in Zimbabwe and how they need someone who could stand for them and also for the love of people who are suffering from different illnesses and how they are in need of counsellors

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
30/11/23, 4:33 pm - Sagar: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
30/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 515 6353: l'm sorry sir but during the day l will be at school
30/11/23, 5:16 pm - +263 77 515 6353: l will probably catch up with you starting from tomorrow
