*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
25/11/23, 5:03 pm - Sagar: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
