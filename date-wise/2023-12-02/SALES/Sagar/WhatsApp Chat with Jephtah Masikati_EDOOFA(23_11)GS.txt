*"All our dreams can come true; if we have the courage to pursue them."*

On this positive note, are we good to begin today's session?
24/11/23, 9:19 am - +263 77 894 6404: Yes we can begin
24/11/23, 9:21 am - Sagar: Alright, so Mrs Matsilele, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Chelsy, is that correct?
24/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 77 894 6404: Yes my son heard about Edoofa Program from that person and related it to me
24/11/23, 9:25 am - Sagar: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Chelsy, also do tell me whether you learnt about Chelsy’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
24/11/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 894 6404: He said that its  a program in the SAARC nations and the African continent that offers 50-100percent scholarships on tuition fees and that it works with 250+Universities in India. Its aim is to make education affordable and get children access to jobs .As for Chelsy l heard he already got a scholarship and is looking forward to studying in lndia thats all in brief.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: Yes that is correct, I see you are well informed.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: But let me also brief you about the program.
24/11/23, 9:42 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
24/11/23, 9:43 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
24/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 77 894 6404: Ohh okay that's great and l didn't know that
24/11/23, 9:49 am - +263 77 894 6404: That is significantly true
24/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 446 3561: Excuses ladies and gentlemen  and soory for not being intouch ,l was out of bundle for the past few days now l am available
24/11/23, 10:23 am - Sagar: It is a pleasure connecting with you Jeptah.
24/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 446 3561: I have hope that l can be one of them
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Okay so Jeptah, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
24/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l am assure that l can but starting tomorrow where l am currently located  there is a network glitch
24/11/23, 10:30 am - Sagar: Let us try to stay connected today as much as we can.
24/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay lets continue

25/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay noted
27/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay
27/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 77 446 3561: What are the qualifications and number of years it takes please  further explain
27/11/23, 10:18 am - Sagar: Yes let me brief you about the program.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: *Bachelor of Commerce (B.com)* is a three year long undergraduate course that is evenly distributed into 6 half-yearly semesters. 

A high number of jobs are available for B.com graduates in industries such as Information Technology, Manufacturing, Telecommunications and Banking.The most sought after B.Com. jobs are Financial Manger, Accountant, Lecturer, Chartered Accountant, Human Resource Development etc.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: The 3 year B.com degree program aims to facilitate a deep understanding of how business organizations work. It develops knowledge and skills in core B.com subjects like Accounting, Finance, Banking & Insurance, Marketing, Human Resources and Taxation.
The entire B.com syllabus is designed in a manner which develops competency in students, allowing them to pursue higher level programs. It also increases practical knowledge and employability.
27/11/23, 10:19 am - Sagar: After being awarded the B.Com degree, candidates can either look for jobs in various departments or opt for higher education.

*B.Com graduates can pursue post-graduation courses such as M.Com (Master of Commerce), MBA (Master of Business Administration), CA (Chartered Accountant), CS (Company Secretary), Actuarial Scientist, and ACCA (Association of Chartered Accountants).*

*B.Com graduates have a plethora of job positions in government as well as private sectors to choose from provided that they are not limited to careers in accounts and finance*
27/11/23, 10:20 am - Sagar: And I would like to bring your attention that this course also enables you to become an Actuarial scientist.
27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 446 3561: That's great 🎯
27/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 446 3561: What about the requirements
27/11/23, 10:44 am - +263 77 446 3561: Or qualifications
27/11/23, 10:48 am - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 446 3561: I hopefully am sir but lwas asking the points needed for B.com
27/11/23, 11:00 am - Sagar: We need 4 points in A-level for B.com .
27/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 894 6404: Which include which subjects
27/11/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: You can score 4 points in any 2 subjects.
27/11/23, 11:31 am - +263 77 894 6404: Okay understood l didn't what to say but l thing my son will qualify cause  he has high hopes
27/11/23, 11:36 am - Sagar: That is great Mrs.Matsilele.
27/11/23, 11:37 am - Sagar: So did you understand the course?
27/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l did thanks l thing it is the course l need cause it's in line with my goals
27/11/23, 1:46 pm - Sagar: That is great, since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

28/11/23, 8:51 am - Sagar: That is really great Jephtah I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
28/11/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 446 3561: I surely am willing
28/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: That is great.
28/11/23, 11:02 am - Sagar: Alright so jeptah, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?

28/11/23, 11:07 am - +263 77 446 3561: My name is JephtahTatenda Masikati l grew up and was born i Chiredzi .l did my primary and secondary education in Chiredzi at Shingai Primary school and Chiredzi Christian College .l was raised by my mom and dad in a family of 5 ,my father passed away in 2016 .l love my family  and my favourite hobby is basketball.

28/11/23, 11:09 am - Sagar: I am very sorry to hear about your father Jephtah.
28/11/23, 11:09 am - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 11:10 am - Sagar: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 11:11 am - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
28/11/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay
28/11/23, 11:13 am - Sagar: Please address this.
28/11/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 446 3561: Other abroad university like Indian university offers high quality education and it is cheap than in my country
28/11/23, 12:02 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
28/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 77 446 3561: I will share with others scholarships available abroad like Edoofa Program also through my earnings l will sponser a student to study abroad
28/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Jephtah, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.
28/11/23, 12:16 pm - Sagar: Don’t you agree?
28/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Also by being an Acturial Scientists l can contribute to my country's decision making towards policies of economic growth and development
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: That is a great thought Jeptah.
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l do sir
28/11/23, 12:17 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?

28/11/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l can see that India is developed
28/11/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: So now Jeptah, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 894 6404: As for me l am now certified
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Also a great place to study
28/11/23, 12:39 pm - Sagar: That is great.
28/11/23, 12:40 pm - Sagar: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 894 6404: No not at all
28/11/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Nope
28/11/23, 12:41 pm - Sagar: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
28/11/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay go on sir
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Sagar: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Sagar: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 12:43 pm - Sagar: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
28/11/23, 12:50 pm - Sagar: In simple words jephtah what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
28/11/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 894 6404: I think it get much affordable with the Earn While You Learn Program
28/11/23, 12:54 pm - Sagar: Yes that is correct.
28/11/23, 12:54 pm - Sagar: Should I brief you about the program? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 894 6404: Yes please
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: Mrs.Matsilele, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/11/23, 1:39 pm - Sagar: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 894 6404: I understand but l would like to know the extent to which the EWYL Program  can cover you tuition fees
28/11/23, 2:01 pm - Sagar: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

28/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sagar: This message was deleted
28/11/23, 2:27 pm - Sagar: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes l think will this will help self sponser my tuition fees
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - Sagar: Jephtah, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Thats is true and favourable to me
28/11/23, 2:31 pm - Sagar: Alright jephtah, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?
28/11/23, 2:47 pm - Sagar: As we are just at the end of this counselling session, I would like you to stay active for 10 minutes.
28/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes they are
28/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yes we are still connected but my network is low
28/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay sir
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sagar: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
28/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 446 3561: sure you may , am ready
28/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sagar: jephtah, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 446 3561: 1500-2250
28/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sagar: Exactly jephtah, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
28/11/23, 3:05 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 446 3561: That's a big relief and is very much appreciated
28/11/23, 3:08 pm - Sagar: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
28/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yeah i agree with you
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: Jephtah basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
28/11/23, 3:11 pm - Sagar: However Jephtah, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay but l have to discuss it over with my family and siblings
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Sagar: Noted.
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - Sagar: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Nope
28/11/23, 3:17 pm - Sagar: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Sagar: Alright Jephtah, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Sagar: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
28/11/23, 3:18 pm - Sagar: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Yeah l sure do understand
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
28/11/23, 3:25 pm - Sagar: So now would you like to ask anything?
28/11/23, 3:40 pm - Sagar: Are we still connected?

30/11/23, 4:31 pm - Sagar: Hi Jephtah, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
01/12/23, 5:40 am - +263 77 446 3561: Can l please have your adress

01/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 446 3561: Good morning to you too all soory for not being intouch the past days l was at my grandmother's ceremony of fixing her grave the past days now on l am available
01/12/23, 11:29 am - Sagar: Noted.
01/12/23, 11:29 am - Sagar: So let us continue the session now.
01/12/23, 11:29 am - Sagar: Please address.
01/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 446 3561: Okay
01/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 77 446 3561: Yeah l was asking about  your adress my uncle wants it ,also the specific amount of tuition fee covered by my scholarship on accommodation, food, transport and fees
01/12/23, 12:13 pm - Sagar: Jephtah, for our address, I will give you the link to our website just after this from which you get all the information about us, and for the cost of education for a student ranges from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. The exact amount that we will cover will be decided after your eligibility session, but as I said before, the minimum scholarship provided is 50% on tuition fees.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Okay soory to slow you we can continue
01/12/23, 1:54 pm - Sagar: Now is there any other concern other than the website link that I will just share now?
01/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 446 3561: Nope l guess
01/12/23, 1:55 pm - Sagar: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
01/12/23, 1:55 pm - Sagar: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
01/12/23, 1:55 pm - Sagar: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.
