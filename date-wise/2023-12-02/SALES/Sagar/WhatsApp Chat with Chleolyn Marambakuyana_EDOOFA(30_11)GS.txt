30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Sagar: Alright so Chleolyn, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
30/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I'm currently studying my lower 6 at Chinhoyi High School which is located in Mashonaland Province of Zimbabwe.  I'm from a middle class family and both my parents are  civil servants.My mother is a police officer and my Father is an educational facilitator. Due to the deteriorating economy of my country, my parents' income is not enough to provide for us all . I have my elder sister who's  studying  her Bachelor's degree with Midlands State University and she's in her Second year. I also have a little brother who will be enrolled for form one in 2024.Due to my parents' income, sending us all to school has been a challenge and as a result , it has been my major reason for looking out for a schoolarship. If given the opportunity, l would like to study Medicine. Adapting to change has been my strength lately as well as   striving so hard in my academics to produce good results. Fear of failure has been my major weakness in my life.
Thank you 🙏
30/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sagar: Great answer, Chleolyn.
30/11/23, 3:47 pm - Sagar: So Chleolyn, could you kindly tell me how much *Chinhoyi High	Mash West* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?

30/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It has been my parents ever since .. as l said earlier, their income is not enough  so they engage in small scale farming every year and they get some additional finance from there . My mother as for the moment she took her leave days at work so that she can help my Father at the farm since we are already in the farming season.
30/11/23, 3:56 pm - Sagar: And what is the fees Chleolyn?
30/11/23, 3:58 pm - +263 73 259 8781: $200 per term .. inclusively with transport money it ranges around $280

30/11/23, 4:01 pm - Sagar: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
30/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I am very much interested in science subjects and literally I'm so good at them . This got me thinking . .. Why can't l do something and make the world a better place? I would like to save lives as many people are dying everyday. This has been my motivation and my love for science subjects can be my greatest strength in learning medicine
30/11/23, 4:09 pm - Sagar: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
30/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Honestly no one .and that's why I wish to be the first one
30/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sagar: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?

30/11/23, 5:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Thanks to you... Have a good time as well
01/12/23, 8:05 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 838 7489: Good morning to you all. My apologies for my daughter's absent online, she is currently at school collecting her report book and are closing today. She will join us soon . Thank you.
01/12/23, 10:15 am - Sagar: Noted, can I know, when she will be available?
01/12/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 838 7489: At around 1300hrs
01/12/23, 10:37 am - Sagar: Noted, I am scheduling Chleolyn at 1:00 PM CAT.
01/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 838 7489: Thank you sir
01/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 73 259 8781: Hello sir my apologies.  1:00 PM will be okay .I am now back from school
01/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Education can be truly a weapon to change the world .This is true since education can create opportunities for individuals to explore their dreams and aspirations resulting in the development of societies and the economy at large. Taking for instance, if the world lacks skilled  doctors and nurses, a lot of people were going to die each and everyday which means that  society development is undermined .Also it is through  education that people gain skills , knowledge and values which helps them to make effective decisions, thus development of societies and communities. However , to give only value to education as as a weapon to changing the world will be unjust since there are other factors which can contribute to the development of the world .  Agriculture can be essential in contributing  positively to changing the world .  How can one learn on a hungry stomach ?? This is completely impossible and that's why agriculture is also  crucial to changing the world positively .We get various goods from agriculture be it Milk , grain ,meat ... However from my understanding access to resources such as food is also essential for improving people's lives and creating a better world .
01/12/23, 1:43 pm - Sagar: It is apreciatable Chleolyn that you took the time and share your understanding of the quote, you truly have understood the motive why I start the day with these quotes.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - Sagar: Now, let us continue the session.
01/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 73 259 8781: It's alright sir
01/12/23, 1:48 pm - Sagar: I would like to bring to your notice that the Indian Education system is known to produce world-class doctors and engineers for the world, and as to set that standard high, studying Physics for Medicine is mandatory in India but I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
01/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will have to research more on the courses  so that I make a decision on which course I can take
01/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 73 259 8781: I will hear from my parents as well so that we come to an undstanding together
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: Noted.
01/12/23, 1:59 pm - Sagar: So should I schedule for tomorrow?
01/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 73 259 8781: Yes that will be fine.
01/12/23, 2:07 pm - Sagar: Noted.
01/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 838 7489: Is it advisable that she undertakes physics   since she has good passes at O level
01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Mrs.Marambakuyana, even if she takes up physics as a subject, she would have to come to India to give NEET exam which is a national entrance exam for medicine aspirants, and if she is able to clear that exam which is very difficult, then only she would be able to get admission in Medicine in India, that is why I have suggested you the courses that follow the passion of your child, are less expensive, and also have a smaller duration than medicine.
