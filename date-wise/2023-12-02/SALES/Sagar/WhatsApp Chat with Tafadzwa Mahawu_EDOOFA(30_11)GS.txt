30/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sagar: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
30/11/23, 5:55 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Thank you so much sir
30/11/23, 5:56 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I'm sorry to be honest with you l haven't learnt anything since l was introduced the Edoofa Program but l would like to learn more
01/12/23, 8:04 am - Sagar: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
01/12/23, 8:05 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah that is actually true good morning sir
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Let us continue the session by briefing you about the program.
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
01/12/23, 8:24 am - Sagar: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
01/12/23, 8:25 am - Sagar: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
01/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yes of cause sir especially the sense of reducing financial burden because my mom is a widow
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: Okay so Tafadzwa, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
01/12/23, 8:47 am - Sagar: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
01/12/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 942 4537: I understand your requirements sir but my mom is an occupied  person she is free on weekends especially Sunday
01/12/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 942 4537: I understand sir but lm willing to give my full participation and best effort in the counselling process, lm am a person of my word l assure you sir
01/12/23, 8:53 am - Sagar: Noted, will she be able to go through the counselling session when she gets free?
01/12/23, 8:54 am - Sagar: And I hope you too will brief her about the program.
01/12/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 942 4537: Yah l will make sure of that and l will tell her everything she has to know about the programme
01/12/23, 8:55 am - Sagar: That is great.

According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sagar: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
01/12/23, 12:27 pm - Sagar: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
01/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I'm am confident about myself sir and l will surely pass and embrace your expectations

01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: *Bachelor of Journalism and Mass Communications (B.J.M.C)* is a 3-year duration undergraduate program for students who wish to pursue their career in Journalism and media industry.
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Sagar: The Career Options and Job opportunities are very high with the media sector. A student who has completed B.J.M.C can work with the news channels, news magazines, publication houses, Media is a connection between the population and the world.

01/12/23, 2:55 pm - Sagar: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
01/12/23, 3:21 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Sir it my honour to write this to you                             l hereby write this essay putting much emphasis on how l see myself after 5 years completion of  the programme and how Edoofa can enable me to achieve my dreams.              International journalism is my passion and my dream too, l see my self as a great person in my society, country and world too after the 5 year completion of the  programme , my dream is to facilitate a good information world for my country and the world at large, l see my self as capable and with great potential and ability to achieve the things l have mentioned above. At the pick of financial crisis I my family Edoofa is like the rising sun that touches the flora and fauna at the beginning of a new spring, lt is like the good samaritan that comes at the right time when the patient needed help. I have 100 % belief that the Edoofa will help me with their scholarship and make a big drive in my to way to become a  successful journalist, l am sure they will provide me with the financial necessities l will need to archive my goals and l really trust their program and have full faith that they will help me.                 Thank you
01/12/23, 3:22 pm - Sagar: That is really great Tafadzwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
01/12/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I as a young boy growing up in a poor society hardwork is the first required survival skill and my experiences have moulded me into a hard worker. I know the industry has many obstacles but my strong sprit and hard work will surely overwhelm them until l reach my goals
01/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sagar: That is great.
01/12/23, 3:38 pm - Sagar: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
01/12/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Studying in my country is actually is good but most universities in my country require points above 14 to do such programs and vacancies are not easily accessible when you come from poor families they require connections and if you see only a minimum number of poor people study in  local universities
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 942 4537: These universities some of them don't offer big programs and those who does offer are overcrowded and has rich people as thier first priference and are not easily accessible
01/12/23, 3:48 pm - Sagar: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
01/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 942 4537: That is actually a gorger question, when l become a journalist at least l will have power to enlighten my people to fight towards change, equality and freedom, in that sense they will fight for change and that will mean a new beginning in the education system where there is just and fairness, similar to the French revolution were  philosophers enlightened the people to liberty, equality and fraternity
01/12/23, 3:59 pm - Sagar: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tafadzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 942 4537: I do agree with you sir everyone is a product of the environment they grow up in and a conducive environment, a good reputation and utmost dedication will help in the drive for change in my community and the education system of my country
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - Sagar: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
01/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 78 942 4537: Yah of cause l want to know but as times pass other countries have fought corruption and created an identity for themselves and they have even developed
01/12/23, 4:09 pm - Sagar: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
01/12/23, 4:10 pm - Sagar: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*
