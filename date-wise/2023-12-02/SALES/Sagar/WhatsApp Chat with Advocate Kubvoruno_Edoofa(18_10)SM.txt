I am *Mr. Sagar*, Career Counselor at Edoofa. Joining me today are *Mr. Shubham*, our Senior Academician, and *Mr. Joytishman*, our Head Admissions Officer.

We've received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. I hope I've reached the right person.

Could you please come online so that we can discuss this further?
18/10/23, 5:40 pm - Sagar: Dear Students and Parents,
I trust this message finds you in good health.

*In light of the ongoing exams and considering that some students and parents may not be readily available during the day, I've decided to extend my working hours to include a night session. This way, we can ensure that no one misses the opportunity to engage in discussions and move forward with the next stages of the program.*

Please feel free to join the night session, and together, we'll work towards making your educational aspirations a reality.

*I will be available from now till 10:30 PM CAT*
18/10/23, 10:05 pm - Sagar: I was expecting your response in the counselling session, but you could not get back to me due to some reason so I am about to finish my second counselling slot for the day, I will have to schedule your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT.*
Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *9:30 AM - 4:30 PM CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during the time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

Kindly go through the link:

19/10/23, 4:37 pm - Sagar: Hi, I hope you are doing well.
I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

26/10/23, 5:00 pm - Sagar: Hello, I hope you are doing well.
Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
30/10/23, 8:51 pm - Sagar: Hi, I hope you are in good health.
I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed in your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
