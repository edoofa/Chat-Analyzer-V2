14/11/23, 8:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Esther, Kindly excuse me for the delay, As your counselor, I would like to propose considering music as a curricular subject. In today's highly competitive world, where youth are often career-focused, I suggest viewing music as a valuable co-curricular pursuit rather than a primary career path.

My recommendation is to embrace music as a hobby while directing your main focus towards another field. Pursuing a professional course in this chosen field will enable you to gain valuable knowledge, understanding, and enhance your employability. By striking a balance between your passion for music and your career aspirations, you can potentially increase your career options.

15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India have a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
15/11/23, 2:37 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to know that!!
15/11/23, 5:22 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Im sorry for replying late there were network challenges
15/11/23, 5:26 pm - +263 71 139 9636: I think studying in India  will have a positive impact on my career as I would have learnt from the best and I'm likely to have more job opportunities  and so I think studying in India is the best . I also plan to achieve my career aspirations from studying in India by being one of the best in my field
15/11/23, 5:32 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Esther, Thank you for sharing this, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
15/11/23, 5:38 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes we are aware and we are also sure that without a scholarship I cannot afford to study abroad
15/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Esther, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/11/23, 5:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 5:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.




*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay that's great
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 139 9636: The amount stated is it in US dollar
15/11/23, 5:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Esther.
15/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes I think they can afford it
15/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay thank you
15/11/23, 5:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
15/11/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 139 9636: No I don't know
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Will the job opportunities be related to course I'll be doing
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Esther, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
15/11/23, 5:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
15/11/23, 5:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
15/11/23, 5:58 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes I think I'll benefit from the Earn while you learn program
15/11/23, 5:58 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
15/11/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay understand very well
15/11/23, 6:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great then, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
15/11/23, 6:02 pm - +263 71 139 9636: The Earn while you learn because it's helps in reducing the amount you pay as well as preparing you for the real world so you don't have to suffer after graduating as you have experience
15/11/23, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Earn While You Learn*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

15/11/23, 6:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
15/11/23, 6:05 pm - +263 71 139 9636: My parents will help me
15/11/23, 6:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
15/11/23, 6:07 pm - +263 71 139 9636: They are happy and also believe that by studying abroad I'll do great in life
15/11/23, 6:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Esther, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
15/11/23, 6:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes it is.....
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes can do please explain
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Esther, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
15/11/23, 6:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/11/23, 6:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
15/11/23, 6:13 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay I understand
15/11/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Esther
15/11/23, 6:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - +263 71 139 9636: We have discussed stage 1 so far
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's correct!!
15/11/23, 6:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
15/11/23, 6:16 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes you can explain
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
15/11/23, 6:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
15/11/23, 7:05 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Yes I'm very clear with the process
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Esther!
15/11/23, 7:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

16/11/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 139 9636: Okay .....As a family we discussed about the Edoofa program and how it is affordable. We came to a conclusion that the Edoofa program has a vision of helping children who are determined to achieve something in life but who do not have enough resources to do so and also helps in finding employment , also, after studying with Edoofa your career has more value because of the place you would have studied in
16/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 139 9636: In short their views were that Edoofa program is a good program in helping children and making a better world , and Edoofa helps.reduce the amount you pay although you first register with about 350dollars and it becomes easier because of the EWYL program..thank yiu

Is the timeframe feasible for you?
16/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 293 7465: As for now we are financially unstable we will get money towards Christmas which will be very far I think

16/11/23, 1:38 pm - Austin#276: Considering your financial challenges, if I request a payment plan for you in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days, $100 by the 8th of December and remaining towards the end of December if Esther qualifies, will it be feasible for you?
16/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 71 293 7465: Okay I understand

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepared to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

a) The Change of Nature

d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.

3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ?
a) enfeeble
b) thriving
c) strengthen
d) debase

4. Explain the phrase ‘gather resolution from danger’.
a) Find peace in times of difficulty.
b) To remain calm and not to lose hope.
c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty.
d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

TOPIC:IS IT TRUE THAT MANY AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE POOR DIETS BECAUSE THEIR FARMS ARE STAGNANT AND INEFFICIENT

Many African countries rely on farming and many  African countries have poor diets as their farms are in poor conditions to the extent that they cannot produce enough food to supply everyone.Therefore the view that diets in African countries is caused by stagnant and inefficient farms is true

Many people live in rural areas where there are are no equipments for farming and where there are no resources to maintain their farms which leads to poor produce and therefore leading to poor diets.Most people in Africa depend on rain to water their plants and rain alone is not a reliable source of  water .

Also, climate changes in the have  affected most African countries because African farmers predict weather before farming and they plant in certain seasons. Climate changes have caused rapid weather changes which have affected farms and African farmers do not have any means of maintain the farms which leads to poor harvests and food shortages.

In conclusion, all of the above are the causes of poor farms in African countries leading to poor diet and therefore, supporting the view that Poor diet is caused by inefficient farms

SECTION 6(MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY)

Growing up in a village where there is no electricity and no water supply has been a tough journey and a grade three you have to learn to carry a 20 litre bucket from the well which is about 1.5km from home . My name is Esther and this is my story

I was born in Bulawayo in 2005 and I grew up there living with my parents, my grandmother and my siblings.
At home we were not financial stable and we were staying in a village somewhere in Bulawayo. Growing up I became used to the situation at home and it became part of my life. I went to primary school until 2018 and after that went to do my secondary school at a boarding school in Gweru. I understood that my parents wanted a good future for me but after 2years I told them to transfer me to a more affordable school
I then went to learn at Howmine Secondary school and I was renting a one roomed house staying with 2siblings. 
I stayed with them for 2 years and me being the mother I used to do the laundry, cooking and cleaning.i finally wrote my O level and passed 7 subjects out of 8.
After that I went to do my A level at Tennyson Hlabangana High School were we walk 5km to school and 5km back home. At some point I wanted to quit school but then my mother gave me hope that it will soon be over .
Today here I am still learning at Tennyson Hlabangana and with hopes that I'll study Legislative law and become a judge one day
To everyone out there don't loose hope as there is a light at the end of a tunnel

21/11/23, 10:21 am - +263 71 293 7465: And I saw that her scholarship falls on 60 to 100 percent where exactly does she fall
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Austin#276: Yes, after your enrollment fee payment Esther can begin with the Earn while You Learn Program investing her free time to gain employability skills and earn scholarship credits to reduce her cost of education right from Zimbabwe
21/11/23, 10:22 am - Austin#276: Basically, the Earn While You Learn program offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
21/11/23, 10:23 am - Austin#276: You can see the cost of education for Idah has been much lesser than that we have discussed as she has been shortlisted for a higher quantum of scholarship. The range of the reduced cost is mentioned on the next page
