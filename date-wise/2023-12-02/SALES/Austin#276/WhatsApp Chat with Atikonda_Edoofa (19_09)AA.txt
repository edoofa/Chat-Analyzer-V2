In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.

This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*

*4. Accommodation*
19/09/23, 2:31 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

19/09/23, 2:50 pm - +265 886 27 61 86: However even though the fee has reduced ,to the family it is not affordable affordable
19/09/23, 2:54 pm - Arshita: I also want to inform you that there are other courses such as *Bsc Medical Lab Technology and Physiotherapy* which offer higher quantum of scholarship *(90-100)* after this the cost of education will range between *$1200- $1800*

19/09/23, 3:01 pm - Arshita: May I know will this be affordable for your family?
19/09/23, 3:07 pm - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes they would afford it but I’m we are still going to go for the first one
19/09/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: That is well noted.
19/09/23, 3:12 pm - Arshita: So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
19/09/23, 3:14 pm - +265 886 27 61 86: No
19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

19/09/23, 3:17 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
19/09/23, 4:33 pm - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes I will be
19/09/23, 4:41 pm - Arshita: Let us connect at  *9:30 am CAT on Wednesday(20/09/23) to resume your session (In case you have any challenges or lessons, you can let me know and we will plan accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness an important parameters of evaluation. If the applicant is occupied with lessons, parents can initiate on their behalf.
19/09/23, 4:43 pm - +265 886 27 61 86: Alright
20/09/23, 9:34 am - Arshita: Greetings!

 *“The only way to have a life is to commit to it like crazy.”*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
20/09/23, 9:35 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes we can
20/09/23, 9:36 am - Arshita: Greetings! 

How are you doing?
20/09/23, 9:37 am - +265 886 27 61 86: I’m doing great how about you
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

I am doing well, thank you!
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Arshita: Have you gone through it?
20/09/23, 9:38 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes
20/09/23, 9:40 am - Arshita: Please answer this
20/09/23, 9:42 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes I will benefit from this
20/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
20/09/23, 9:52 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 10:03 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes now I understand
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
20/09/23, 10:07 am - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
20/09/23, 10:18 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Point number one
20/09/23, 10:19 am - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

20/09/23, 10:23 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Okay
20/09/23, 10:28 am - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
20/09/23, 10:29 am - +265 886 27 61 86: My parents
20/09/23, 10:34 am - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
20/09/23, 10:37 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes we will discuss this and my family is happy with this
20/09/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: Good to hear that!
20/09/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
20/09/23, 10:38 am - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
20/09/23, 11:01 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Well right now I don’t know
20/09/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: Our admissions team will assist you with everything
20/09/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
20/09/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
20/09/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 11:03 am - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
20/09/23, 11:06 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yes
20/09/23, 11:06 am - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
20/09/23, 11:07 am - Arshita: However Atikonda, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
20/09/23, 11:08 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Alright
20/09/23, 11:09 am - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
20/09/23, 11:10 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Okay
20/09/23, 11:12 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 11:15 am - +265 886 27 61 86: I think stage number 4
20/09/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: Absolutely correct! 

Let me explain you stage 5 and 6
20/09/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/09/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/09/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
20/09/23, 11:16 am - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
20/09/23, 11:20 am - +265 886 27 61 86: Yeah
20/09/23, 11:21 am - Arshita: Do you have any questions?
20/09/23, 11:21 am - +265 886 27 61 86: For now I don’t have any
20/09/23, 11:21 am - Arshita: That is well noted.
20/09/23, 11:37 am - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

22/09/23, 8:58 am - Austin#276: Good to know you, Ms Mwayi!
What are your thoughts on the Edoofa Scholarship Program and do you have any questions for me please?
22/09/23, 9:02 am - +265 880 68 78 91: Am assuming the sponsorship is dependent on the grades that one has got in their high school (secondary school) national exam. If yes ,do you have specific aggregate points that one should have gotten for them to be eligible? What other eligibility criteria is there. Apologies in advance if some of these questions have already been asked previously
22/09/23, 9:12 am - Austin#276: Thank you for the questions!
Please note that the Edoofa Scholarship is a merit based scholarship offers 50-100%  on tuition fees(Accommodation too for certain programs), The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

So the universities will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of the scholarship
22/09/23, 9:42 am - +265 880 68 78 91: Thank you so is this application done online in a link, how does one send the information to you. When is the deadline for applications ,are there any other language requirements eg tests that have to be written in advance?
