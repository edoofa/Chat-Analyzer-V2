As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
22/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 642 0587: Yes
22/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 642 0587: This is my background
22/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 642 0587: Is there anything you like to know aswell

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please,
22/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 642 0587: It is my pleasure
22/10/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Bruce, you happened to mention the financial instability, may I know more about the same?
22/10/23, 12:27 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yes, due to the fact that my brothers have just finished their high school and are seeking for a college education and also because  of the current situation we are in as a family. I have failed to get a stable job that can help finance  our  cost of living later alone effectively support for their college education, partly because of my field - the job market requires me to have advanced degree or professional  certification and because I we have a single parent as well
22/10/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand please, Bruce.
22/10/23, 12:30 pm - Harmehak: Firstly, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Ok
22/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Thankyou I understand
22/10/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Very well!

Now considering you would require financial support for your higher education, may I know how are you planning your education from a financial aspect?
22/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I am seeking for an international scholarship where I can. Work and  study at the same time to cover other expenses.. or a sponsor if it's possible, I would  wish to have a full 100 % scholarship if possible or something very close to that
22/10/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa provides scholarship, Bruce.
22/10/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Along with the same you cannot work in India on a student visa please.
22/10/23, 4:30 pm - ~ Bruce Nelson Jnr added +263 71 333 5025
22/10/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT as my working hours for the day are over.

23/10/23, 8:51 am - +263 77 642 0587: This is very informative, however, where it says cost after school i.e $2000 -$3000 does it also include the const for things like accommodation and food..if not what has been the average cost of living for most the students that have been enrolled in the program for the past few years, and lastly is the Currency in USD?.

23/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 642 0587: This was my question
23/10/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Kindly ensure active participation, Bruce!
23/10/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same?
23/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Very well

25/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 642 0587: Austin and Augustine

25/10/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 642 0587: We would like to know the exact amount  of money remaining  after the each our  scholarships..thats the way we are going to be able to know if we can meet the costs for all of us ..because you mentioned before that the scholarships will range for 50%-100%
25/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 642 0587: That is if it's alot closer to 100%for atleast on of us or  two of us then the cost will be relatively low
25/10/23, 11:04 am - +263 77 642 0587: Otherwise will have to finance the boys, Austin and Augustine first and I would  go after them
25/10/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: I believe we happened to discuss the finances, isn't it?
25/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 642 0587: Yes but is this reduction the same to each and every student ..or some get it  less and others get it more, since you initially said there is a range 50-100%

25/10/23, 2:06 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Is it possible to discuss about him in this group without repeating the information that we have already shared in the new group?

30/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 642 0587: That's great
30/10/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Bruce 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
30/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yes I believe you have shared with us  before during our first conversation
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/10/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/10/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I'm you specified here
30/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yes
30/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 642 0587: We are aware that the cost will be lowered up to about $2000
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Through your program ofcose
30/10/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

I believe you would recall the same as well?
30/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yes
30/10/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail!
30/10/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
30/10/23, 3:23 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
30/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Ok that's great
30/10/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I understand
30/10/23, 3:30 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

30/10/23, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/10/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Thankyou for sharing
30/10/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome
30/10/23, 4:09 pm - Harmehak: Inform me once you have gone through the video.
30/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yah I have seen
30/10/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I have
30/10/23, 4:24 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
30/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I understand
30/10/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: Bruce, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
30/10/23, 4:26 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 642 0587: It's about 1500  to 1750
30/10/23, 4:29 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Based on the above figures
30/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 4:30 pm - Harmehak: Bruce, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Yes but  what of the eligibility check is it done after admission to your program or before?
30/10/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 642 0587: This application fee is for Edoofa application or for Universities in India??
30/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Firstly you qualify for the program and then you pay after receiving your acceptance letter.
30/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/10/23, 4:35 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 642 0587: College Acceptance letter or Edoofa scholarship program acceptance ?
30/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Noted with thanks
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: You receive Edoofa acceptance letter, Bruce,

After which you pay the enrollment fee and in parts.

The enrollment fee includes the application fee for multiple universities associated with Edoofa, like mentioned.
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
30/10/23, 4:41 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Thankyou I'm still absorbing the information
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Its comprehensive
30/10/23, 4:46 pm - Harmehak: That's alright, I understand please.

I can be over-whelming.
30/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 642 0587: I kindly wish to read it in depth  and  would require more time to share it  with my parent can we  continue tomorrow  after lunch if it's possible since when everyone is available with good internet access
30/10/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please, we would be concluding the discussion now itself and I would also be connecting you with a parent, and providing you with resources for family discussion.
30/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
30/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
30/10/23, 4:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
30/10/23, 4:50 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

30/10/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 642 0587: Ok thank you so much I will likely  have some questions  for you tomorrow is that ok
30/10/23, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: That's completely fine, 

Tomorrow you would be proceeding for a discussion with Mr Sahil.
30/10/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
30/10/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/10/23, 5:01 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

08/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 77 642 0587: Good morning
08/11/23, 11:38 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
08/11/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 755 5903: We are well..How are u
08/11/23, 12:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
08/11/23, 12:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 12:57 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 14th or 15th November 2023 for $200 and the 14th or 15th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 14th or 15th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
08/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 755 5903: Morning..and thank you for a full explanation..I prefere the 1st option..of paying 200 in seven days..then remaining 150 on 15 to 15 December..I think it will work for me

20/11/23, 11:16 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning 
How are you doing today ?
I hope you are reserving your seat today !@263776420587 @263719200520 @263713335025 @263777555903
20/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 920 0520: Good morning
20/11/23, 11:28 am - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing ?
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 920 0520: Electricity at our place.... Caused by heavy rain.
20/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 71 920 0520: Our phone could be off
20/11/23, 7:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me guide you about the payment modes.
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
20/11/23, 7:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

01/12/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Greetings

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. 

Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
