16/11/23, 11:39 am - +263 77 233 5075: As a family we have set up to mould our family on the  on the basis of strong education as a pillar of wisdom and empowerment. Not only in gaining societal advantages but a contribution to community and possibly national growth. This is as we  strongly  believe in getting things done aiming as high a possible as well as indoctrinating our children on appreciating that handwork opens doors to achieving any goal.  we have therefore taken it upon ourselves to set an example o our children by embarking on an academic journey,  Mr Mike graduating with a  Bachelor of Science Degree in Business Management specialising in Entrepreneurship at age 51 and going on to acquire a Masters in Entrepreneurship at 52, myself graduating with a B Com Business Management and subsequently  Master of Strategic Management only recently at age 54 .  this has rather become a motivation for our children who now set themselves to achieving even higher qualifications. as witnessed by Takudzwanashe wish to enrol for a  degree in medicine with your esteemed University.  We have two other sons one aged 20  studying for a degree in  Bachelors of Science Honours Degree in Geomatics and the eldest one who is  is working and furthering his studies by undertaking a Masters in Strategic Marketing. Therefore our support for Takudzwanashe is  guaranteed.  Despite the economic  challenges have managed safely manage to combine our resources from the family business in which we do construction work  with my monthly income from salary as well as farming that happens at our rural plot where small scale cattle anching is taking place.

16/11/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please,

So I would like to know Takudzwanashe better as a student!

How he is at school, his interests and hobbies?

Do tag along his current subject combination.
16/11/23, 12:10 pm - Harmehak: Are we connected please?
16/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Takudzwanashe is a very keen young man, whose determination to achieve goals is clearly visible. An example is when he managed to sit for his O level and managed to do paalel exams for his larnes licen nd subseuently  to aquire
16/11/23, 12:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: +

He surely seems to be a dedicated and hardworking student.

Do confirm his subjects please, his student file has a record of Mathematics, Chemistry and Biology.
16/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Takudzwanashe is a very keen young man, whose determination to achieve goals is clearly visible. An example is when he managed to sit for his O level and managed to do parallel  exams for his learners licence and divers licence at one sitting for both. and he now drives to   and from school as well a family around.  he is also keen to pas even in the dark where there is no electricity he use alternatives to ensure he does his studying.  his cobinatio is mathematics, Biology and Chemistry
16/11/23, 12:21 pm - +263 77 233 5075: combination
16/11/23, 12:22 pm - +263 77 233 5075: my apologies for typos.
16/11/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 233 5075: He is very good in basketball and good in computers
16/11/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: It's great to know more about him, Mrs Angela.
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: I'm also happy to share that many Christ Ministries students have been chosen for this over the previous few years. One such example is Anesu Kaunga, a former student who is also the son of *Mr. Shelton Kaunga*. He is one of Mr Sahil's students and was given the opportunity to study in India. Anesu takes great pride in belonging to the Edoofa community.
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Thank you for the information
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Our meeting with *Mr Shelton Kaunga, the Head of Christ Ministries High School, Harare* .
16/11/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please

16/11/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Thank you
16/11/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through these resources please?
16/11/23, 12:46 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes we did from the main group
16/11/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Angela, I can see you mentioned Takudzwanashe's inclination towards Medical sector, so what motivated him for the same?

As you all are majorly into Business sector and mastered into the same itself.
16/11/23, 1:00 pm - +263 77 233 5075: He had always wanted to prove himself from a tender age. To be distinct  in a way. Actually his determination sets him to take on challenges head on.  he says I want to take this p
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 233 5075: he does it. maybe another aspect could be his caring nature.
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 233 5075: we also happen to have uncle who s a pharmacist, his son who is a Chemical biologist, and another cousin who recently graduated as a pharmacist in the UK. So iti could  be something n the bloodline
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 233 5075: or a motivation in a way coming from the broader family unit.
16/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please, 

That's interesting to know Mrs Angela!

So did he happen to research about the requirements as well?
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: yes he ha always gone though all  comunications on this platform as well a researched on the proffession
16/11/23, 1:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: gone through
16/11/23, 1:20 pm - Harmehak: Oh Alright please, so why didn't he opt for Physics in his subject combination, Mrs Angela?

I believe it's a crucial science subject, wouldn't you agree?
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes it is
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: You see, since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 233 5075: I see
16/11/23, 1:23 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*

16/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 233 5075: We will advise ji
16/11/23, 1:25 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Him accordingly

16/11/23, 6:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Mrs Angela 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 233 5075: No Ms Harmehak
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 233 5075: We don't have
16/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Kindly assist
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Alright please!
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
16/11/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

16/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Ohhh that's really incredible 👏
16/11/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
16/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Wow that's great
16/11/23, 7:01 pm - +263 77 233 5075: The earn as you learn is real good initiative
16/11/23, 7:02 pm - Harmehak: I am pleased to have you acknowledge that!
16/11/23, 7:03 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Angela, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 7:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes we do
16/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Mrs Angela!

So given the costs are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India?

Along with an opportunity like the Earn While You Learn Program.
16/11/23, 7:25 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes we now understand <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/11/23, 7:29 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

16/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes indeed
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
16/11/23, 7:55 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
16/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Thank you
16/11/23, 7:56 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
16/11/23, 7:57 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

16/11/23, 8:01 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mrs Angela, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes Ms Harmehak
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Angela, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
16/11/23, 8:04 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
16/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 233 5075: This message was deleted
16/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 233 5075: 1500 to 2250
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 8:10 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mrs Angela, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
16/11/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Quite understood
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
16/11/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
16/11/23, 8:18 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Yes we have
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
16/11/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
16/11/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

16/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 233 5075: And thank you for the contact
16/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Will definitely get in touch with her
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mrs Angela.
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
16/11/23, 8:32 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

21/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 233 5075: thank you
21/11/23, 2:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are you ready for the same ?
21/11/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 233 5075: yes
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

21/11/23, 3:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26TH or 27TH November 2023 for $200 and the 26TH or 27TH of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26TH or 27TH  of November 2023.

28/11/23, 12:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing ?

28/11/23, 2:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please for that Physics chemistry and Biology is mandatory if he can share these results then we can offer him medicine
28/11/23, 2:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: These criteria are universally established, mandating Physics, Chemistry, and Biology at the A-Level for healthcare courses and Physics and Maths for engineering courses.

It's crucial to underscore that these criteria are not set by Edoofa but adhere to global standards. We appreciate your dedication to your academic journey and stand ready to support you in exploring alternative paths that align with your goals. Should you have any further questions or if there's anything else we can assist you with, please feel free to reach out.

Your trust in Edoofa is highly valued. It's essential to clarify that eligibility for studying medicine adheres to universal standards, and reputable institutions would not mislead students on this matter. Edoofa, being a government-registered organization, is committed to providing honest guidance.

If someone claims you are eligible for studying medicine without meeting the necessary criteria, it is likely an attempt to deceive and exploit financially. Edoofa places a strong emphasis on transparency in our processes. It's important to understand that even completing a medical course from a third-grade university may pose challenges in obtaining a practicing license, as medical boards typically do not approve licenses for individuals who haven't met the required standards.

Our commitment to transparency has earned us recognition from education ministries, including your country's education ministry, and the support of the First Lady of Zimbabwe. If you have further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to guide you honestly and ensure that your educational journey aligns with your aspirations.
28/11/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 233 5075: Thank you very much Mr Sahil. This is very much for this insightful information. We will definitely get in touch for any form of assistance 👏🏻👏🏻
