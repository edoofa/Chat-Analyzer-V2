You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

05/10/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: The network disturbance causes problem for me to completely understand what you say,

05/10/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: You can take your time.
05/10/23, 1:18 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah sure
05/10/23, 1:20 pm - +250 781 163 822: He just told me a few things about your program but I would love to continue learning from you.
05/10/23, 1:35 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Divin
05/10/23, 4:16 pm - +250 784 150 672: Thank you so much for giving me this time so that I can express myself and give you a brief background of myself and even share with you my experience. My name is Kevin kwizera I was born on 16th July 2002 and I am a third born in the family of three boys and one girl. 

My educational background holds a unique and meaningful story, one that was deeply influenced by the bond between my brother and me. Our mother, in her unwavering determination to ensure we received an education, embarked on a quest to find a way for both of us to study. During my primary school years, an individual recognized my potential and took it upon themselves to cover my school fees. This support allowed me to excel academically. However, as I transitioned to ordinary level education, the financial burden became overwhelming for my mother. Determined to continue my studies, my mother reached out to the education sector, seeking assistance. Thankfully, they recognized my academic performance and offered to sponsor my entire three-year ordinary level education.
Following the completion of my ordinary level education, I had demonstrated strong academic performance and was eager to continue to the advanced level.  

 However, I found myself in a challenging financial situation with no means to cover my school fees. This predicament left me feeling desperate and on the verge of losing faith in my educational pursuits. Despite my determination, I struggled to secure a sponsor or any form of assistance. My mother, too, was deeply concerned and uncertain about how I would continue my education. At that juncture, the path forward appeared unclear, and the prospects for my education seemed grim.

However, my older brother Divin had the remarkable opportunity to enroll in Agahozo Shalom Youth Village. The school known for its commitment to providing education to vulnerable yet academically gifted children. This institution's selection process spanned across all districts of Rwanda, and I vividly recall the day of the selection, a day filled with both anxiety and hope. I fervently prayed for my chance to be included, and providentially, my mother received a phone call from Agahozo Shalom Youth Village. The school not only offered free education but also provided essential school equipment. This transformative moment marked a significant turning point in my educational journey.

My mother's unwavering belief in the value of education drove her to fiercely advocate for our access to a quality education. She held a profound aspiration for us to fulfill the educational dreams she herself had been unable to pursue. I am proud to say that both my brother, Divin, and I successfully pursued our studies at Agahozo Shalom Youth Village, achieving academic success. Divin is currently pursuing higher education at a university, while I have recently graduated from Agahozo Shalom Youth Village. Meanwhile, my sister is in her final year of high school at the same institution. Unfortunately, our older brother, Niyonkuru Patrick, faced financial constraints that led to his discontinuation of education after completing his ordinary level. Despite these challenges, he resiliently forged a different path to sustain himself.
In the future, I aspire to become a great entrepreneurial leader and a successful businessman, ready to make a positive impact on the world and address problems that seem unsolvable to others. Additionally, I aim to continue my studies and demonstrate to my mother that her relentless efforts in securing a better education for me were not in vain. I want to show her that I am determined to fulfill my dreams of becoming an accomplished individual, and I hope to bring her excitement and pride once I achieve a high level of education in the future.

I possess a diverse set of strengths that I believe contribute to my professional and personal growth. Foremost, I maintain an insatiable curiosity and a relentless eagerness to acquire new knowledge and skills. This enables me to adapt and thrive in dynamic and evolving situations. My effective time-management skills, strong work ethic, and unwavering determination to achieve my goals empower me to succeed in the face of challenges. Additionally, my creative and innovative thinking abilities allow me to approach problems with fresh perspectives, fostering inventive solutions. Lastly, my proficiency in communication and capacity to collaborate within teams enhance my effectiveness in achieving shared objectives. These strengths collectively shape my approach to personal and professional development.

While I bring a range of strengths to the table, I also recognize that I possess certain areas for improvement. One of my weaknesses is an inclination to focus excessively on details, which occasionally leads me to linger on tasks longer than necessary. This can result in me being overly critical of my own work and setting demanding deadlines for myself. At times, I find it challenging to let go of tasks, leading to a tendency to overwork. It's important for me to strike a balance between attention to detail and efficiency in order to optimize my performance and maintain a healthier work-life equilibrium.

One of my most significant hobbies is my passion for professional photography and videography, where I consider myself a filmmaker. I channel my skills and creativity into crafting content with the potential to make a positive impact on the world and contribute to a better society. An illustrative example of this is my collaboration with the Street Bridge Foundation, where I have had the privilege of working towards uplifting impoverished and vulnerable children. In this role, I have been responsible for producing compelling visual content, including photos and videos, that sheds light on the daily lives of these children. The objective is to showcase their circumstances to a global audience, inspiring support and financial contributions that can facilitate their access to quality education and ultimately help them escape the hardships of life on the streets. This experience has profoundly influenced my perspective, emphasizing the importance of collective action and the belief that what one person possesses, another can attain as well. Thus, I view my camera not just as a tool but as a catalyst for transforming the lives of these deserving children through the generosity of donations and our shared commitment to making a difference.

When I'm not behind the camera, I indulge in a variety of interests and activities. Sports, particularly basketball and football, have been a source of joy and accomplishment for me. During my school years, I had the privilege of leading my school to victory in several inter-school competitions, adding a sense of fulfillment to my life. Additionally, I have a strong affinity for debating, and I actively organized interclass debate tournaments in my school, fostering my own personal growth. I am an avid reader, constantly seeking to expand my knowledge and enhance my critical thinking abilities. In my free time, I engage in online research to further my understanding of various subjects. Moreover, interacting with street children is a heartfelt endeavor for me. Armed with my camera, I teach them valuable skills, providing companionship and recognition to those who may feel isolated or overlooked.

My early life was marked by challenges, as my father passed away when I was young, leaving behind little in terms of material possessions due to his lack of stable employment, as my mother recounted. My mother, too, is elderly and primarily dedicates her time to caring for her aging mother. To sustain ourselves, my siblings and I hustle in the city, working hard to make ends meet and supporting our mother financially. However, despite our efforts, financial stability remains elusive, especially as I lack essential equipment such as a camera and related materials. Consequently, I often find myself in difficult circumstances and work multiple part-time jobs to contribute to our family's financial well-being. My unwavering motivation is to create a better future for my family, as providing for them is my driving force, even in the face of considerable challenges.
In conclusion, my unwavering drive in everything I undertake is rooted in my profound desire to make my mother proud. She has been a tireless fighter on my behalf, and now, it is my turn to stand up for her. I am committed to achieving the kind of high-quality education she envisioned for us, and I firmly believe that once I seize the opportunity to study and excel, her pride in my accomplishments will be immeasurable. Her pride will serve as a powerful source of motivation for me, propelling me to strive for excellence. I am fully aware that the key to my future success lies in my own hands, and I am resolute in my determination to utilize any educational opportunity to its fullest potential. With clear goals and dreams firmly in sight, I am confident that I will make the most of any opportunity that comes my way.
05/10/23, 4:17 pm - Harmehak: Let me thoroughly go through the same and get back to you.

I couldn't get back today as I had to attend an emergency,

I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 9 AM CAT please,

Your patience is highly appreciated.

Have a blessed evening ahead.
06/10/23, 8:22 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah it's okay!!!
07/10/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: I understand please
07/10/23, 10:23 am - +250 784 150 672: 🙏🏾
07/10/23, 10:23 am - +250 784 150 672: How are you doing?
07/10/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

I had the opportunity to thoroughly go through everything you shared and I would surely like to take a moment to appreciate your mother's efforts to assist you and your siblings.

It's great to know of your personality traits and hobbies too along with your details about your siblings and how financial constraints never stopped them!
07/10/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: I am doing well, thank you!
07/10/23, 10:30 am - +250 784 150 672: Yeah! Thanks for the appreciation please
07/10/23, 10:32 am - Harmehak: Well Kevin now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/10/23, 10:40 am - +250 784 150 672: Of course it's a life changing decision.
07/10/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/10/23, 10:47 am - +250 784 150 672: since I've seen how my mother has done much to help me study, I feel like I owe her a debt and I hope that once I get that opportunity to get a higher education abroad I would make sure that my dreams of making her proud comes true and also utilise all opportunities and resources around me to create a better place and abetter community, I wish to be that changemaker the world wants to see.
07/10/23, 10:51 am - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Kevin, it's great to know your thoughts.

So you happened to mention financial instability too!

May I know more about your financial support for higher education?
07/10/23, 10:51 am - +250 784 150 672: I am really ready, whatever it can take so that I achieve one of my goals of having a better education abroad! I am really ready for a life abroad.
07/10/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: That's great
07/10/23, 10:53 am - Harmehak: Please?
07/10/23, 10:57 am - +250 784 150 672: Basically I am looking for a scholarship, although my mother fought for me to get a better education it wasn't about her financial ability rather it was a support from other people and I am a scholarship hunter because I have no other people to count on so that they can financially support me.
07/10/23, 11:10 am - Harmehak: I completely understand please!

So what's your understanding of financial aspect of the scholarship as to what expenses would be catered for?
07/10/23, 11:22 am - +250 784 150 672: Would you please explain for me a little bit about the question?
07/10/23, 11:39 am - +250 784 150 672: I think From my understanding, the financial aspect of the scholarship typically covers tuition fees, textbooks, and sometimes living expenses. However, I would appreciate any specific details or guidelines regarding what expenses the scholarship may cover.
07/10/23, 11:41 am - +250 784 150 672: And even maybe transport expenses
07/10/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
07/10/23, 12:54 pm - +250 784 150 672: I do have one! 

What requirements are considered to be eligible to get an Edoofa scholarship and what does Edoofa Scholarship covers ?
07/10/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Program provides scholarship on tuition fee please.
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - +250 784 150 672: Does it cover the whole tuition please ?
07/10/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: We do provide 50-100% scholarship on tuition fee.
07/10/23, 12:58 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah! Now I am aware!
07/10/23, 12:59 pm - +250 784 150 672: What are the requirements someone has to possess to get an Edoofa Scholarship ?
07/10/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa Scholarship Offers 50-100% scholarship on tution fees,

The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment.

The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences

07/10/23, 8:16 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand, Kevin.

However along with the Earn While You Learn Program, you would require financial support.

*"Never give up until you've given out all your very best. It's better to fail trying than wondering what could have happened if you tried." - Jermaine Lamarr Cole*

10/10/23, 11:21 am - +250 784 150 672: Good morning ! 
Yes, I am ready !
10/10/23, 12:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 12:25 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Go through this document once .
10/10/23, 12:28 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yes!
10/10/23, 12:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Inform me once you are done
10/10/23, 12:43 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah I will inform you
10/10/23, 12:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +250 784 150 672: Hello!
I went through the document and I am done
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can you please share your understanding ?
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - +250 784 150 672: May I use a voice note or I just use text?
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: No please
10/10/23, 3:35 pm - +250 784 150 672: Firstly, I am excited about the Edoofa program and now I am aware of the Edoofa and the scholarships , I am thinking how Edoofian scholars are more courageous and hardworking and responsible and I had this feeling of whom would I become if I get that chance of being admitted and this was just a feeling I had when I was reading the document you shared with me, and by this I want to share my understanding about the document you shared with me.

I was impressed by how the Edoofa program equips the scholars to be more engaged and being responsible and having the best attitude and due to this I've found how EWYL makes scholars gain valuable work experience while also earning scholarship credits and this is the best part of their uniquness that this Edoofa program has,which makes the tuition fee more affordable .


The vision of the Edoofa program is more crucial to someone's life and dreams since this programs provides skills which can be used even when someone returns back to his/her country to develop the country and this is rare in some countries and this is the best thing that Edoofa Program has,and due to this I have seen that Edoofa program not only providing every paved path for you to move but also socially scholars can become winners since they have the following 3 aspects like *Attitude,Skills and Knowledge* .

Financially, I have seen that Edoofa program provides with internership opportunities to scholars which reduces their college fees and not only this which made me more impressed but also how Edoofa make sure they stay with the student throughout their academic life as mentors and caretakers which is more impressive.
10/10/23, 3:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you in touch with Amani your child's friend who got scholarship this year , he arrived in India today

10/10/23, 4:29 pm - +250 784 150 672: Nowadays it's not easy to reach him maybe it's because he has not yet got that plenty of time to use social medias or maybe he's busy
10/10/23, 4:50 pm - Sahil Edoofa: He will soon have a Indian sim so I can share his number with you

10/10/23, 7:39 pm - +250 784 150 672: Thank you for the question! Honestly no one in my family who supported me in my studies because our School Called Agahozo Shalom Youth Village in Rwanda, I got a chance to be admitted there since they bring vulnerable students some of them who were victims of the Genocide against the Tutsi 1994 and by this I didn't pay anything because it was a free education which I was given and no one in my family.
10/10/23, 7:39 pm - +250 784 150 672: I will be there for sure at 10:00Am
10/10/23, 7:45 pm - +250 784 150 672: I love this, how the Edoofians are proud of the Higher education they are being given !
11/10/23, 10:02 am - +250 784 150 672: Good morning !
11/10/23, 11:16 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?

11/10/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Who will help you for your education abroad?
11/10/23, 12:20 pm - +250 784 150 672: Honestly I am looking for a scholarship
11/10/23, 12:22 pm - +250 784 150 672: Education abroad is too expensive and I don't have that ability for sure!
11/10/23, 1:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Even after scholarship there are certain extension to be paid by you how will you manage that ?
11/10/23, 1:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can consult Amani about the financial prepartion he did as he also got 90-100% scholarsrhip !
11/10/23, 1:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: When an organization extends its support to you, it's important to understand that education is a collaborative effort. It's not a process where all the responsibilities and sacrifices can be shouldered by others, while you play a passive role. Scholarships are not merely about receiving financial aid; they are about empowering individuals who are willing to take an active role in their own education and future.

Expecting someone else to do all the hard work and sacrifices on your behalf signifies a lack of commitment. It's crucial to recognize that scholarships are not charity programs solely based on financial need. If scholarships were purely distributed on this basis, a substantial percentage of the population, particularly in regions like Africa, would qualify for them. However, in reality, only a very small fraction of students are awarded scholarships.
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Scholarships are carefully allocated to academically talented individuals who have demonstrated a strong commitment to their own education. They are designed to provide opportunities for these students to access high-quality education and reach their full potential.

In cases where both students and their families are looking for scholarships as a means of avoiding personal effort and responsibility, scholarship providers may question the wisdom of investing in such individuals. Scholarships are meant to support those who are dedicated to their own educational journey and are willing to work hard to achieve academic excellence. They are an investment in individuals who are determined to contribute to their own success and make the most of the opportunities provided to them.
11/10/23, 1:27 pm - +250 784 150 672: Thank you so much for the clarification and I am ready to take part in a way that I can even financially support myself without waiting for others to help me but also I liked the EWYL, these opportunities given to scholars are more interesting since they help a scholar pay his/her college fees and with all this explanation you gave to me, I understand how both individuals take part in order to make it more collaborative and by this I am sure that I can find a way to pay some of the expense maybe from my friends or other family members or even get some loans
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Who in your family will support ?
11/10/23, 2:15 pm - +250 784 150 672: My big brother who is in this group will support me!
11/10/23, 2:17 pm - +250 784 150 672: But I wonder, how much does this person who can support me pay?
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - +250 784 150 672: I just want to know the range of amount ?
11/10/23, 2:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: He is into which profession ?
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - +250 784 150 672: He's in IT (Profession)
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - +250 784 150 672: Information Technology
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - Sahil Edoofa: In which organization please?
11/10/23, 4:27 pm - +250 784 150 672: The organisation is called Kivu Choice
11/10/23, 5:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Is your brother helping you financially for your education abroad ?
11/10/23, 5:36 pm - +250 784 150 672: When I get an admission maybe he can support me financially
11/10/23, 6:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Is he helping you in your school ?
11/10/23, 7:09 pm - +250 784 150 672: No! Because the school I graduated from is a non profit organization and provides education for free and I am a graduate waiting to join university.
11/10/23, 7:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Who will help you for your education abroad ?
11/10/23, 7:29 pm - +250 784 150 672: Maybe if I get that chance and I get admission, my brother could do what he can to help me financially but if you mean the whole tuition he's not able to pay it because abroad needs alot of money
12/10/23, 11:04 am - +250 784 150 672: Good morning

13/10/23, 2:07 pm - +250 784 150 672: Edoofa program has a good and impressive history in it's way through giving affordable higher education to African Students and due to this I just want to study Business Administration as a course with Edoofa program because I've seen how Edoofians themselves release their thoughts about if it wasn't about Edoofa program Education abroad would be impossible and this made me more touched and due to this my country is facing a professional a problem where youth have no time to think about their careers and even they think that business is small field rather it's a big field where we learn Leadership skills,communication skills and other valuable skills which I want to acquire from from Edoofa Program and spread it my younger generation.

Through all this, I remember after creating and initiating a business club in my school, I just found that we were born with ideas and burning ideas and due to this I just want to attain that higher education with Edoofa program and later on I want to spread everything I learnt with Edoofa Program in my Country where there is alot of Business ideas and I wish I will be organizing some youth workshops and make sure whatever they think is on the table and maybe the government after seeing that there is a place to find the potential you have, later it may invest in us and even if this can't happen all I can is to try use my skills I gained in India with Edoofa Program and also available resources to be utilized and make our country develop to a quicker speed .


To conclude the Reason I want to study Business Administration as a course abroad with Edoofa Program, I just want to come back in my country and participate in it's development and also create a better place with good standards of living, but also create a learning community.

17/10/23, 11:49 am - +250 784 150 672: All of these people graduated from India🫡
17/10/23, 12:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?.
17/10/23, 12:28 pm - +250 784 150 672: Studying in India can provide a unique perspective, enriching my knowledge and understanding. It can help me stand out in my performance, bringing fresh ideas and approaches. My Indian degree can be a stepping stone towards my career goals, providing me with the necessary skills and exposure. I aim to leverage this education by applying the learned concepts in my work, continuously learning, and networking effectively. This way, I plan to climb the career ladder and achieve my professional aspirations.

Quality education,Networking opportunities,Diverse culture,work opportunities,skill Enhancement and other different skills which I can gain from Indian studies all of this would make me come back in my home country and participate in it's growth and development.

Engage with professors, classmates, and professionals to expand my network. By leveraging these opportunities, I  can gain a competitive edge in  business-related career and work towards achieving my career goals.
17/10/23, 12:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Amazing
 
As far as I can tell, you recognise Edoofa's commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their study, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of  similar quality higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
17/10/23, 1:23 pm - +250 784 150 672: Not really sure
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - +250 784 150 672: It's probably around $8000-$9000,
17/10/23, 2:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me share with you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly .
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc.It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,gym,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
17/10/23, 2:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/10/23, 3:34 pm - +250 784 150 672: It's not affordable for our family
17/10/23, 3:35 pm - Sahil Edoofa: let me tell you something special and valuable to Edoofians. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further. 
And do you have any idea how that's done?
17/10/23, 3:50 pm - +250 784 150 672: EWYL! If work opportunities are always available, simply it's afforbale for someone to pay the remaining fees

17/10/23, 5:40 pm - +250 784 150 672: Miriam witnessed this for sure and by now I feel like with EWYL, it's possible to earn alot of money and this makes individuals to be responsible of how to use the money and by this scholarship credits are available and this is something good for me and for the parents because they can't worry much about the fees
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2.     *Employability through practical training*​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
17/10/23, 5:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
 
4.     *Higher Education Concierge*​: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
17/10/23, 7:03 pm - +250 784 150 672: Honestly every point here is amazing and has alot to in it that can change someone's perceptions positively but as you said I like the last point "Higher Education Concierge" because the way you take you stay with the students throught their journey of Higher education this shows how you're more than a family and close with the students and that is a bond built which is mostly different from other universities abroad and still this is the uniquness that Edoofa program has.
17/10/23, 7:09 pm - +250 784 150 672: But if possible you may explain for me about the point number 1 I just want to know more about the savings of the students
17/10/23, 7:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now let me brief you on another benefit of the Edoofa Program.
As you know through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. But did you know that here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees as well.
 
Would you like me to explain how that happens?
17/10/23, 8:19 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah sure!!! I just want to be aware
17/10/23, 8:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Share with me
17/10/23, 8:43 pm - +250 784 150 672: I was wondering if a student may save up to $1000-$1500, how long does it take him)her to save up that money or it depends on how he/she is interested or how he/she is involved and do the work opportunities
17/10/23, 8:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright so can you tell me what is the first thing you would be supposed to do when you wish to apply for a university
 
You buy an application form by paying the application fee, isn't it?
17/10/23, 8:56 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah ofcourse but sometimes some universities may have fee waiver
17/10/23, 9:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So do you know how much the application fee is for an international student for any college on your own?
17/10/23, 9:04 pm - +250 784 150 672: I am not sure because I haven't applied yet
17/10/23, 9:05 pm - +250 784 150 672: But I wouod like to know the application fee
17/10/23, 9:11 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Well,if you research you will find that on an average Application Fee of a University is around $150-$200.So if you want to apply for 5 different colleges, you will have to pay the application fee for each college differently.So how much will the total expense be on just the application fee?
17/10/23, 9:52 pm - +250 784 150 672: It's probably $750-$1000
17/10/23, 10:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: it would be around $750-$1000 but even if you apply to 5 colleges after paying the application fee, do they provide you any assurance whether you will be given admission or scholarship?
17/10/23, 10:10 pm - +250 784 150 672: Not at all
17/10/23, 10:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly and do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.Our students are allowed to enroll in the program only if they clear the eligibility.And once they are a part of Edoofa, not only the admission but also the scholarship is assured for that Student.
 
But the real challenge is to get eligible. Do you think you are capable of this challenge?
17/10/23, 10:52 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah sure! I am ready for that challenge
17/10/23, 10:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I will be helping you with the details , so as you know,to get Eligible you will have to pass your Eligibility Check Interview, therefore I would guide you towards the same.
Now going to another point, Do you know anything about Statement of Purpose(SOP)?
17/10/23, 10:54 pm - +250 784 150 672: I am not sure about that? Maybe you may help me get aware of it?
17/10/23, 10:56 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you by explaining that,An Statement Of Purpose (SOP),is a subjective document of a student to communicate or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strength, achievement in the past, vision and dreams, why one opted to read a particular course, why one is seeking admission, and why one needs to be considered.

 
This document is a professional document as the chancellor of the university goes through these in-order to decide which application they should take in consideration!
 
So Statement Of Purpose is a very important document which a student needs to prepare when he/she wishes to apply abroad.There are organizations that help you build SOP and charge $120-$200 to build it.
Now do you understand the importance of SOP?
17/10/23, 11:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: We will now connect back tomorrow at 10 Am CAT time to resume your session.

www.edoofa.com
18/10/23, 7:20 am - +250 784 150 672: Actually it's very important!
18/10/23, 7:20 am - +250 784 150 672: Good morning
How you're doing great
18/10/23, 10:03 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
18/10/23, 11:43 am - +250 784 150 672: I am doing great
18/10/23, 11:43 am - +250 784 150 672: Hope you're fine too
18/10/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Yes please!
18/10/23, 11:43 am - Harmehak: Indeed!

Kevin, So now as you have understood what an SOP(Statement of Purpose) is, I hope you realize that for different universities a student needs to prepare different SOP’s, therefore, can you tell me If a student applies to 5 Universities on his/her own.
 
How much would he/she have to spend on 5 Application Forms as well as 5 SOP's?
18/10/23, 12:23 pm - +250 784 150 672: I think the person would spend  $500 to $1500 to 5 application status.
18/10/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
18/10/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
18/10/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Kevin, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
18/10/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I would appreciate your active participation, Kevin.
18/10/23, 2:39 pm - +250 784 150 672: I think so
18/10/23, 2:40 pm - +250 784 150 672: Thank for you and I appreciate the way you approach undergraduate and they say you help them in their counseling sessions
18/10/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
18/10/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
18/10/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
18/10/23, 2:42 pm - +250 784 150 672: This is good and I am curious about how's the eligibility check interview is?
18/10/23, 2:43 pm - +250 784 150 672: For the payment, you make it easy for the eligible students and this is amazing
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be briefed about the same in the next session please.

However it would be conducted through video call with the Program Director.
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
18/10/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
18/10/23, 2:53 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah I understand the process
18/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
18/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$750) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
18/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
18/10/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 3:01 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah! Now I understand the LSAT step
18/10/23, 3:01 pm - +250 784 150 672: I mean I understand the last step
18/10/23, 3:02 pm - +250 784 150 672: Wow! This is the picture of Visa
18/10/23, 3:02 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
18/10/23, 3:03 pm - Harmehak: I believe you must be aware that Amani is now in India, Kevin?
18/10/23, 3:10 pm - +250 784 150 672: Yeah ofcourse and I always see his photos how he's happy and this is amazing and one thing is that many students were told about Edoofa but many didn't give it time to bring their heart to it but me I knew that Edoofa is a program that provides affordable higher education and I visited it's websites after my colleagues gave up, I just continued and if I get that chance to pass the eligibility check , I want to bring my dreams into reality through Edoofa Program.
18/10/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Kevin.
18/10/23, 3:11 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
18/10/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
18/10/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

18/10/23, 3:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.

18/10/23, 3:43 pm - +250 784 150 672: Is it possible that when Edoofa program accepts a student but the University choosen by the students rejects him/her?

18/10/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: No please, the admissions team provides you acceptance letter from different universities and you finalize the university after a discussion as a family.

The universities donot reject the student.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program.

19/10/23, 7:58 pm - +250 784 150 672: I am sorry for being late to reply because I was taking care of something but I have a question.

What happens when a student is accepted by Edoofa program but maybe there is other situations which can hinder him/her to attend ?
19/10/23, 7:59 pm - +250 784 150 672: The situations maybe not allow the students to attend, so how do you deal with that ?
19/10/23, 8:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I appreciate your understanding regarding the delay today, which was a result of technical issues with my device. To ensure we can thoroughly discuss your application, let's reconvene tomorrow at 10 AM CAT time.

20/10/23, 8:31 pm - +250 784 150 672: The session was totally amazing and I would like even to thank her how she was so humble since we started our sessions and even if we got some other inconvenience, maybe like internet issues but everything was amazing and every question I had , she did her best to answer me.

Also she did her best to explain everything about the Edoofa Program to the extent where I stated to explain everything about Edoofa easily because Mrs. Harmehak explained well how Edoofa works .

To wrap up, I loved the way we made the session more close like as if we know each other face to face and this is something I liked from her, we conversed as people who normally meet and I really appreciate for her time and maybe you can show her this message if possible.

After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship.

22/10/23, 1:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
22/10/23, 2:41 pm - +250 781 163 822: <Media omitted>
22/10/23, 2:42 pm - +250 784 150 672: 👆This is the message from my brother
22/10/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
22/10/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
22/10/23, 2:55 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 26th or 27th October 2023 for $200 and the 26th or 27th  of November for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 26th or 27th  of October 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
22/10/23, 6:52 pm - +250 781 163 822: Is the range between 26th and 27th?
22/10/23, 6:53 pm - +250 781 163 822: I think there if you may put a difference of 7 days I can try my best to pay that $200
22/10/23, 6:54 pm - +250 781 163 822: I would prefer to pay $350 26th or 27th  of November if possible.
22/10/23, 6:55 pm - +250 781 163 822: Thanks.
22/10/23, 7:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: October
22/10/23, 7:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling our discussion for tomorrow at 10 AM CAT as my working hours for the day are over.

I wish you a blessed evening ahead.

25/10/23, 2:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Then who in your family will manage that ?

25/10/23, 2:02 pm - +250 781 163 822: Thanks.
25/10/23, 2:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you yourself have call with Amani and his mother >
25/10/23, 2:18 pm - +250 781 163 822: No but why? Kevin just talked to Aman and I don't know her mother.
25/10/23, 2:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: To understand the process and to understand the requirements
25/10/23, 2:28 pm - +250 781 163 822: We don't have the contacts of his parents.

26/10/23, 11:29 am - +250 781 163 822: When you talk about the point of supporting Kevin on his education abroad financially I get confused because as I have told you I am his big brother now though I got an occupation I pay for my university fees and other living cost so as I have mentioned I can support him for the admissions fees but if there are other costs I can't manage.
26/10/23, 11:29 am - +250 781 163 822: But I can mention that in a video let me just get settled and send a video.

26/10/23, 12:58 pm - +250 781 163 822: I think I have already mentioned that we have only our mother. She uses one plot of land which might be a 1/4 of hectare. She shares with other rural area farmers they cultivate it and then they share the production because she no longer cultivate as she is suffering from her backbone. What she gains from that small plot of land she doesn't have any savings for now she is 54 years old so yeah.
26/10/23, 1:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So you are paying for her utilities as well?
26/10/23, 1:26 pm - +250 781 163 822: Yeah sometimes I got some money left.
26/10/23, 1:27 pm - +250 781 163 822: But yes I do support her if have the means.
26/10/23, 1:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How will Kevin pay for other expenses required for living abroad?
26/10/23, 1:30 pm - +250 781 163 822: If I have followed the sessions well there is a time where you mentioned that he might get a job or something that he may also adapt for some expenses needed. C'se for me honestly I can't promise that I can handle other expenses for Kevin.
26/10/23, 1:30 pm - +250 781 163 822: But what specifically are those required expenses?
26/10/23, 1:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Living expenses , personal expenses
26/10/23, 1:40 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Remaining tution fees if any.
26/10/23, 1:41 pm - +250 781 163 822: I understand now. It can be tough on him if he doesn't have a job. C'se I can't manage it alone.
26/10/23, 1:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If he has to study in Rwanda how will he manage it?
26/10/23, 2:10 pm - +250 781 163 822: I am not sure how but he will be hunting the government 's scholarship which is also hard to get due to a higher number of the graduates from high school looking for government scholarship.
26/10/23, 2:30 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Does he wish to study in Rwanda or India ?
26/10/23, 2:31 pm - +250 781 163 822: Ofc'se he needs to study in India.
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Has he applied for any other scholarship ?
26/10/23, 2:53 pm - +250 781 163 822: He can answer that himself.
26/10/23, 3:10 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
26/10/23, 5:19 pm - +250 784 150 672: I haven't applied anywhere and I am interested to study in India
26/10/23, 5:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What motivates you to study in India?
26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +250 784 150 672: The main thing that touches me is that in India there is high affordable education and even most graduates from India are mostly famous and rich which stimulates the Indian's quality education .

I just want to have even more opportunities found in India so that they may shape me in my future career through indian education.
26/10/23, 5:27 pm - +250 784 150 672: I even know some of the people from Rwanda who had studied in India and they witnessed the amazing education from India which makes me interested too

30/10/23, 10:20 am - Sahil Edoofa: Heartiest congratulations to you and your family,Kevin, *as your application was found to be eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. I have been so happy, as well excited myself when I saw you passed the eligibility check stage👏🏽👏🏽.* 

As the results have been officially conveyed by the Academic Board via email, it is essential to acknowledge them. Furthermore, for your convenience, we have attached the Acceptance Letter from the Board to this group.

You are supposed to acknowledge the result via Email , and go through your Acceptance Letter properly. Did you do the same?
30/10/23, 10:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 10:26 am - +250 784 150 672: Yes I went through the acceptance letter
30/10/23, 10:26 am - Sahil Edoofa: That is great @250784150672, so as of now would you like to ask anything please?
30/10/23, 10:27 am - +250 784 150 672: Let me just forward this acceptance letter to my big brother so that he can be aware of this
30/10/23, 10:28 am - +250 781 163 822: I am also reading and passing through the letter.
30/10/23, 10:28 am - Sahil Edoofa: Alright @250781163822
30/10/23, 10:32 am - +250 784 150 672: Questions:

1. How much is a parent expected to pay per month, let's say Kevin became an Adoffian what amount of money is he expected to pay except the enrollment fees?
2. What do you base on while grading and giving Kevin 80-100% of the scholarship?
3. Why do you make it $200 not half - half of the enrollment payment? 
4. How do you basically support a vulnerable kid who can't even find the enrollment fees? Is he/she kicked out of the interview process? 

Thanks.
30/10/23, 10:33 am - +250 784 150 672: Here you mentioned that I've received a scholarship range between 80%-100% and on the acceptance letter there is 60%-100%??? Why did it change??? I was just asking?
30/10/23, 10:35 am - Sahil Edoofa: @250784150672 let me help you out with all these questions in the first place. However before I get into the discussion can you explain to me according to you, Is studying abroad a big decision or a small decision for any student/family?
30/10/23, 10:36 am - +250 784 150 672: It's a big decision taken by a family
30/10/23, 10:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Now if you do feel it is a big decision, do you think any family can plan for their child's international education without appropriate preparations?
30/10/23, 10:40 am - +250 784 150 672: Ofcourse they prepare?
30/10/23, 10:41 am - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly Kevin, and since you do feel that for international education proper preparations are required, let me help you have a clarity that Edoofa helps a student and his/her family inorder to be prepared for such an education so that eventually they do not get financially burdened.
30/10/23, 10:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: The questions which you have shared, make me feel that you and your brother are still not clear about what exactly is the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
30/10/23, 10:43 am - +250 781 163 822: The question was @919821838532 in the previous interview you mentioned something like giving Kevin an 80-100% of the Edoofa scholarship and now 60-100% on the letter why?
30/10/23, 10:43 am - Sahil Edoofa: Don't get me wrong but to me it feels that you and your brother have a misunderstanding that you are interacting with some admission agent. So let me help you have the clarity.
30/10/23, 10:44 am - +250 784 150 672: Yeah I think this is the problem only?
30/10/23, 10:44 am - Sahil Edoofa: @250781163822 , addressing your question of yours, I would first like you to please understand that Edoofa is not an Agent wherein we are only associated with 1 University. If that would have been the case I would have told you the exact fees during the counseling session itself, the reason I shared the annual fees in a range is that Edoofa is associated with 250+ UGC-recognized universities and that is why we are able to reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-$3000 a year, which includes their *Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well*, and  *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Now what you have is a very common question that any family member of the student has is why aren't they told of a fixed annual fee beforehand so that they could plan for the cost properly. I am sure similar might have been your concern as well, which is why I would again like to bring it to your knowledge that Edoofa is not an Agent that is only associated with 1 University. 

Through Edoofa a student interacts with multiple Universities during their University Interaction Stage which is Step 5 of the Edoofa Cycle as well. 

Now it is obvious that every university would evaluate a student's application differently which means, after the University interaction, when the student receives multiple offer letters stating the exact quantum of scholarship from the universities, the student and the family members are given full liberty to choose a University based on the Quantum of scholarship they have provided to the student itself. This way the parents and the student gets to choose the most affordable higher education as per their own financial plans.
30/10/23, 10:45 am - +250 781 163 822: No its not like that. We had some confusions. As a parent you can have so many questions regarding where your kid is going!
30/10/23, 10:45 am - +250 781 163 822: And what it takes.
30/10/23, 10:46 am - Sahil Edoofa: What the Letter of Acceptance states that based on the evaluation he is eligible for minimum 60% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on tuition and accommodation, I am sure you would recall that it was shared during the process as well that it would now depend upon how Kevin's further process is completed by the student and family members, which in further stages would determine the final quantum of scholarship.
30/10/23, 10:47 am - +250 784 150 672: This is good
30/10/23, 10:47 am - Sahil Edoofa: However despite the same, there Letter of Acceptance Guarantees Kevin as a student that his annual fee after scholarship would be between $1200- $1800 a year including accommodation, food and basic university expenses for the entire year!
30/10/23, 10:48 am - +250 784 150 672: I think now it's obvious and explained and let's go through the program Earn while you learn
30/10/23, 10:49 am - Sahil Edoofa: Go ahead, what would you like to ask about it please?
30/10/23, 10:50 am - +250 784 150 672: If a students starts to work after paying the enrollment fee how much does he expect to earn to cover the turion fee and the best question I want to ask is " does Edoofa program promises a student to give him/her an internership that will make him earn money or it's kind of hunting a job
30/10/23, 10:52 am - Sahil Edoofa: @250784150672 I didn't get your question clearly please, do you mean to ask whether under the Earn While You Learn Program a student is given appropriate projects and assignments which would help him/her earn scholarship credits?
30/10/23, 10:53 am - +250 784 150 672: Yeah ofcourse??? Does Edoofa program does his best to find projects or things that can help him/her earn money or it's not a guarantee
30/10/23, 10:53 am - Sahil Edoofa: Or you meant to ask if after the course is completed whether Edoofa would help a student in securing a job please?
30/10/23, 10:53 am - +250 784 150 672: No
30/10/23, 10:53 am - +250 784 150 672: Please
30/10/23, 10:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: Kevin to help you have a clarity about this, I would like to refer you back to our discussion where I did explain to you that Edoofa assures a student of abundant projects and assignments that would help a student earn scholarship credits that might be even more than the entire year's cost of education for the student, however the sole responsibility would be of the student to work hard so that he can earn scholarship credits.
30/10/23, 10:58 am - Sahil Edoofa: If I may ask, would anyone give you a guarantee of any kind of job if you as a person will not be willing to work hard in the first place?
30/10/23, 10:59 am - +250 784 150 672: I think this is well explained and thank you
30/10/23, 11:00 am - +250 784 150 672: Absolutely you mean that Edoofa is willing to give projects and assignments to students but who are willing to work hard which is good because the ones who are committed are the survivors
30/10/23, 11:01 am - +250 784 150 672: Then, can someone start those projects when he/she is still in his/her country when the time to go in India has not reached.
30/10/23, 11:04 am - Sahil Edoofa: Yes Kevin, the only reason why projects and assignments gets started immediately after a student secures his/her admission is because that helps the individual in accumulating as many scholarship credits as possible, which eventually helps him/her in ensuring that they have the overall control of how they would like the education to be self sponsored!
30/10/23, 11:07 am - +250 784 150 672: Good!!! If I may ask under Earn while you learn , what projects are being included???
30/10/23, 11:09 am - Sahil Edoofa: Let me help you have a clarity @250784150672!
30/10/23, 11:09 am - +250 784 150 672: Yeah sure!
30/10/23, 11:12 am - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 11:17 am - +250 784 150 672: Yeah now I can understand
30/10/23, 11:17 am - Sahil Edoofa: So now Kevin, what else would you like to ask?
30/10/23, 11:20 am - +250 784 150 672: I think I fine after how you totally explained everything ??? And I am sorry to ask many questions ???
30/10/23, 11:28 am - Sahil Edoofa: Kevin you shouldn't be sorry for your questions, I am glad you shared as many questions as possible!
30/10/23, 11:28 am - Sahil Edoofa: So far is there anything your brother would like to ask please?
30/10/23, 11:28 am - +250 781 163 822: Nothing for now.
30/10/23, 11:29 am - Sahil Edoofa: Alright @250781163822, so coming to the modes of fee completion, I hope you have understood the same properly from the Letter of Acceptance?
30/10/23, 12:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are we connected @250784150672 @250781163822?
30/10/23, 12:10 pm - +250 781 163 822: Yeah.
30/10/23, 12:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: @250781163822 are you clear about the mode of fee completion please?
30/10/23, 12:21 pm - +250 781 163 822: Still looking into it.
30/10/23, 12:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Alright @250781163822
31/10/23, 10:06 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning @250781163822 @250784150672
31/10/23, 10:06 am - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you are doing well please!
31/10/23, 10:06 am - +250 784 150 672: Good morning!
I am doing great !
How about you????
31/10/23, 10:11 am - Sahil Edoofa: I am doing well Kevin
31/10/23, 10:13 am - Sahil Edoofa: Kevin, while,  I do understand that your deadline of completing the required enrollment formalities is of 6th November, however as a student you would end up having the the key benefit of early decision, in case your process starts early along with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of October 2023. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.
31/10/23, 10:13 am - Sahil Edoofa: It would be much more beneficial for you incase your family manage to complete a part of the formalities on or before 31st October which would be today.
31/10/23, 10:14 am - +250 784 150 672: You mean we pay today
31/10/23, 10:14 am - +250 784 150 672: Actually my brother by now is not yet paid, I think you may give us some extra time please ?
31/10/23, 10:18 am - Sahil Edoofa: Kevin, if It would have been in my hands I would have surely granted you, however please understand. The key benefit of early application is for every round of intake, today is the last date of October round of Intake which means that by today if an applicant secures his/her seat they would have the benefit of an early applicant in the entire further process.
31/10/23, 10:46 am - +250 784 150 672: If that's how it is! Then this is not my chance because we don't have money by now! If I had the money immediately I could have paid! But it's not my fault ?
31/10/23, 10:47 am - +250 784 150 672: The problem is the financial ability !!!!
31/10/23, 10:57 am - Sahil Edoofa: I do understand @250784150672, and please don't get me wrong, I am not pressurizing you please. I am just presenting you with the best possible opportunity which is there!

03/11/23, 1:33 pm - +250 781 163 822: I am so sorry for not replying to this directly but unfortunately we can't be able to pay now. We might go in need of some few days to pay the initial amount of the admission fees. Kevin is committed to learn but there are some financial constraints on our end. Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused since I previously said that I was gonna manage the payment because there some amount of the project I did and I was expecting the money soon but seems it will take time. I don't know if we may have an extension of at least a week?

03/11/23, 1:35 pm - +250 781 163 822: You mean the other $200?
