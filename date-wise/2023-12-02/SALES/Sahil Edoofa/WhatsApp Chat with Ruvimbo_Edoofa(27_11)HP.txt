28/11/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great
28/11/23, 2:11 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
28/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 270 4815: That's great news I am hoping she did her best in her A level exams inoder for you to take her into your consideration

28/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 200 6792: Well have always been a vibrant student so l think this field will suit me best
28/11/23, 2:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate the same please.
