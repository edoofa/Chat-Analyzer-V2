Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
01/11/23, 9:32 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please let me know.
01/11/23, 9:36 pm - +27 73 798 5824: No plz highlight on this
01/11/23, 9:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mr. Brilliant! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
01/11/23, 9:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
01/11/23, 9:41 pm - +27 73 798 5824: Yes it is reasonable cheap
01/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Norman, we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
01/11/23, 9:45 pm - +27 73 798 5824: Ummm no idea u cn help
01/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Brilliant. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
01/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

01/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
01/11/23, 9:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for Norman?
01/11/23, 9:51 pm - +27 73 798 5824: Yes in tht the procedures are almost similar to University of South Africa (Unisa)
01/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
01/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
01/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
01/11/23, 9:52 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

01/11/23, 9:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how Norman can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on his parents? <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 9:57 pm - +27 73 798 5824: Yes its ok
01/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
01/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
01/11/23, 9:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
01/11/23, 10:07 pm - +27 73 798 5824: The 4th one
01/11/23, 10:09 pm - +27 73 798 5824: But not very familiar with the most appropriate one I need your assistance
01/11/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Brilliant. One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
01/11/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mr. Brilliant. May I know which one is your favourite, please?
01/11/23, 10:18 pm - +27 73 798 5824: I wl come back to you 2moro after scrutinizing it together with my counterparts
01/11/23, 10:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 10:28 pm - +27 73 798 5824: Thank may my good God bless you too
02/11/23, 9:03 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Learning never exhausts the mind." – Leonardo da Vinci*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
02/11/23, 9:30 am - +27 78 744 7591: Yes
02/11/23, 9:33 am - +27 71 936 4092: Ready
02/11/23, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mr. Muronya and Mrs. Rosemary!
02/11/23, 9:39 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated in the previous session, please? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 9:42 am - +27 78 744 7591: Yes
02/11/23, 9:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mr. Muronya! Can you please answer this question?
02/11/23, 9:50 am - +27 71 936 4092: Option no 4
02/11/23, 9:51 am - +27 78 744 7591: 2
02/11/23, 9:54 am - +27 71 936 4092: We are happy with all of our above as long it adds up to our child's progress
02/11/23, 10:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that, Mr. Muronya! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
02/11/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Rosemary! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
02/11/23, 10:09 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for your understanding, Mrs. Rosemary! We share the same goal, and we're committed to ensuring that everything aligns with Norman's progress and success! <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 10:10 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Norman studying abroad?
02/11/23, 10:12 am - +27 71 936 4092: I'm fully satisfied
02/11/23, 10:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate his career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling him to independently support his family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for his parents.
02/11/23, 10:16 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it? <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 10:16 am - +27 78 744 7591: More than happy
02/11/23, 10:19 am - +27 78 744 7591: Ok
02/11/23, 11:26 am - +27 71 936 4092: Thank you
02/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Mr. Muronya!
02/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
02/11/23, 11:48 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
02/11/23, 11:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 11:49 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
02/11/23, 3:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
02/11/23, 4:16 pm - +27 71 936 4092: Yes we are still connected
02/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their Grade 12 result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final Grade 12 results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
02/11/23, 4:20 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

04/11/23, 4:15 am - +27 71 936 4092: I understand the payment policy yes but I really need more hustling time as i was not enough prepared since I was busy enough in preparation for my child's exams. Here for the preparations it's all like paying double due to extra classes and e.t.c. .Thank you .
04/11/23, 6:45 am - +27 71 936 4092: Thank you very much sir, I will try by all means to settle this amount. Otherwise it's understandable

04/11/23, 11:37 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
04/11/23, 11:40 am - +27 71 936 4092: Ok noted
04/11/23, 11:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: We are left with Step 5 and Step 6.
So shall I explain them to you, please?
04/11/23, 11:41 am - +27 71 936 4092: You  can go ahead
04/11/23, 11:42 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

His child is a beneficiary of the Edoofa scholarship program and is currently pursuing studies in India. I believe that Mr. Darlington can offer you valuable information about his experience with the Edoofa scholarship program and how it has enabled his child's international education journey.

04/11/23, 12:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Rosemary. I would like to kindly inform you that to meet the minimum eligibility criteria for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students should achieve the basic passing grades as per the South African Education Board. Additionally, I always encourage my students to strive for excellence, as higher scores can lead to a higher quantum of scholarship. I trust that Norman is well-prepared and confident in his ability to achieve this!
04/11/23, 12:43 pm - +27 71 936 4092: Amen,  thank you

10/11/23, 10:16 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
11/11/23, 8:26 am - +27 71 936 4092: We are fine sir how are you
11/11/23, 6:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
Shall we start our today's session?
14/11/23, 12:28 pm - +27 71 936 4092: Yes we can
14/11/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How are you doing today ?
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 1:29 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th or 21th November 2023 for $200 and the 20th or 21th  of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th or 21th  of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
14/11/23, 7:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Waiting for your response.
14/11/23, 8:11 pm - +27 71 936 4092: 2
14/11/23, 8:12 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can parents please answer this using voice notes .
14/11/23, 8:21 pm - +27 71 936 4092: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 8:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please you have take a step now based on these 2 options
15/11/23, 12:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
How are you doing today?
16/11/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
I was expecting your response since yesterday may I know what challenges are you facing so that I can help you! @27835377395 @27719364092 @27787447591 @27737985824
16/11/23, 12:36 pm - +27 71 936 4092: Thank you very much for your kindness sir. We agree with all the rules and policies but we are still organizing cash.

16/11/23, 1:24 pm - +27 71 936 4092: Will you please allow me to pay in January
16/11/23, 1:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Norman, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Norman's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
16/11/23, 1:29 pm - +27 71 936 4092: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 1:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Norman's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Norman's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?@27719364092
