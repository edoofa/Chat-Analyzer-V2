29/11/23, 2:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, could you kindly tell me how much *Midlands State University* charged you every semester, and who in your family financially supported your education?
29/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 78 806 1412: The fees was always changing but it ranged from 200-300usd  and my mother used to send me some pocket money she is the one who supported me though.she doesnt earn much
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since pursuing higher education is a significant undertaking that demands both mental and financial support, may I know who will be financially supporting your education abroad?
29/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 806 1412: To be honest at the moment dont have anyone i am looking for a fully funded scholarship
29/11/23, 4:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Blessing. May I know what is your understanding of the term "Fully Funded", please?
29/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 806 1412: i mean a scholarship where things like accomodation ,school fees and all the related expenses pertaining the study
29/11/23, 7:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
