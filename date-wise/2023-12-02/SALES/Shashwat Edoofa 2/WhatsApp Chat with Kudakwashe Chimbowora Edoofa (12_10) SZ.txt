Firsty I understood that this philanthropic movement. Is making meticulous recruit for students who wish to further their tertiary education. It is looking for the most eligible candidates which compromises academical might and other skills. It's not basing on how needy or desperate someone is, but there to tap out potential and mentor leaders. Pertaining to university, it made an emphasis that mentors and counselors will assess and come up with the best and most suitable campus in which the candidate will conform and adapt easily. This progressive scheme it exposes candidates to internships, in which experience is inculcated while while persueing a degree. This program makes it easy to for visa application.

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*
