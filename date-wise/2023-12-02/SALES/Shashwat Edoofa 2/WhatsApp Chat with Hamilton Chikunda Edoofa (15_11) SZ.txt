So shall we start the session?
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:10 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Yes ,, let's proceed with the session.
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That's the spirit! Now being your Counselor, I would like to know you better as a student so please tell me more about yourself. Basically, your educational qualifications, Achievements, the name of your school, your ambitions, your interests and hobbies, your parent's highest qualification and present profession, and a detailed description of your family background.
15/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Firstly I thank you Counselor for giving me this time so as for me to present  more about myself .Well last year l wrote my O level examinations at Terry Goss High School in Triangle . I managed to score 4 Bs constituting of English, Combined Science , Agriculture ,then our mother language ,2Cs  in Biology and Geography unfortunately last but not least 2 Ds in  Mathematics and Physics.So basically l wrote 8 subjects and managed to get 6 out of the 8 .

As a stunted ant Terry Goss l was enrolled into the prefectural bord in 2022 .l varied out my duties and responsibilities until my ruling term was over and l was awarded with a certificate of leadership as an archiement of one of the best Senior perfects . 

This year 2023  , l enrolled at Terry Goss high school as lower sixth student in the department of Sciences with a combination constituting of Biology ,Crop Science and Geography.
15/11/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Fortunately during my O level period my best sports or hobbies were athletics fr example relays 4× 100m ,long jump and javelin throw but unfortunately now am more into handball as of when l started my lower sixth grade . 

When l was young l was more interested with aviation industry and wanted to do more with engineering but because of limited resources l found myself  to be more of  agricultural and environmental type of person. 

Unfortunately my background is kind of sometimes a pushback to because sometimes we struggle to find adequate resources. I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters ahead of me , then 2 young sisters . Fortunately some of  my brothers and sisters  managed to be adults but as of  us who are still going to school sometimes because of the econical status school fees ,basic school kits or necessities may become unconsidered. So in other words l am not exposed to such lot of technological advances for study use and that so on is a push back itself .

My father managed to pass his O level and became a teacher fr some time but as of now he is now an operator at a sewage plant in Tongatt Hulett . 

Apart from me and my father  in our family no one has managed to reach O Level and without being said am the first person to proceed to Advanced level of education .The family's demand to basic and important needs like food , clothes and so one sometimes hinders our educational system as sometimes we fail to obtain learning kits like books.
15/11/23, 9:53 pm - +263 78 780 5513: My ambition as a student is to become an Agronomist in the department of the Agricultural sector. Certainly in Triangle Estate  production of sugar from sugarcane is their up most goal and growing up in such an environment l have come tos uch extence that l think it's best we keep on flowing flowing with the already leading business and development favourable to our area. Certainly am sitting for my final A level exams next year but the unfortunate part l worry about is that my even if l manage to score the consider passes ,my family won't be able to afford the next educational level .

 I thank you Counselor

01/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Certainly,,, unfortunately my previous results were weakest  where l am supposed to be speculating high .Still my ambition is to become an Agronomist however l am still trying to grasp the upper  Level concept and l am sure l will improve as l proceed on .

Zimbabwe itself is an Agrobased economy and I find Agrobased opportunities, businesses more progressive than any other ones  .My ambition, my  motivation is because of this which holds our country's backbone , the bread busket of SADC . Authough at these point of time it may seem impossible or no hope , l just keep on because l know my goal , my destiny  .

To be part of Edoofa to learn more about my career can be a great opportunity to expose me more into great archievements not only for myself but for the community and the country at large .

Here in Zimbabwe Agricultural sector is the most supported project and determination.Rural areas and other communals are based on agriculture to get their source of food and income as well.
01/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 780 5513: Because of being exposed to such environments , l find it beneficial to work with what is already there and keep on modifying it so as to attain more and more products , improving knowledge to the farmers so as the country to produce higher and higher productivities which would fullfil it's needs and let it remain as the well-known breadwinner of the SADZC community 

Thank you
