09/08/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon,* ☺️
I  trust this message finds you in good health. I would like to bring to your attention two significant matters:

1. It's time for you to get your *WEDNESDAY WISDOM*. So, Quickly come on the Line and address your presence. 

2. Today, I have planned to schedule a video call with you at *6:00pm sharp.* Here is the link to the call. Kindly be on time. Your punctuality will be greatly appreciated.
*https://meet.google.com/tsq-gprs-nct*

Thank you for your attention to these matters. I look forward to your presence and participation.
09/08/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Abigail so you have shared 22 Community Building forms so far and nobody enrolled out of these 22 students.
09/08/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.
09/08/23, 10:21 am - +91 89683 22920: It's okay ma'am we will meet at 6
09/08/23, 10:22 am - +91 89683 22920: Oh it's fine noted ma'am

Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.

Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

20/08/23, 11:18 am - +91 89683 22920: Hello ma'am😊
May you kindly share some messages to share with students who are applying for the  Edoofa scholarship program
21/08/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Abigail
I hope you are doing great. Yes, Sure
21/08/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/08/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

21/08/23, 10:21 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:

 Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

*Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
21/08/23, 11:32 am - +91 89683 22920: Hello ma'am I'm doing well will get back to you

29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️
30/08/23, 5:29 am - +91 89683 22920: Morning ma'am. Enjoy your day with your loved ones I will be learning about Rakhi too I really want to know all your cultures

[9/3, 6:01 PM] Manjenjenje🦓: *The Edoofa Program*  

• Edoofa is an Educational program which firmly focuses on *Quality Higher Education* that *leads to*
*employment.* 
As we see with the changing times & ever-increasing penetration of internet, there is an 
increasing demand by employers for new age skills and experience along with college degrees 
from the students.
Edoofa has, *over the last 10 years* , been recognised  as the premier institution to focus on this 
area by becoming employability partners of Government Recognized Top Indian 
Colleges/Universities.

• To be able to positively impact the lives of more and more students, Apart from the menace 
of *lack of employability* within the students, Edoofa has recognized another problem that it 
wants to solve. 
The problem pertains to the *lack of affordability* that is currently affecting millions 
of students who struggle to get higher education each year.

• Therefore, Edoofa has created *a unique opportunity* by taking over the seats in various universities and colleges 
(under State Government universities for example, The Punjab Technical University, Uttarakhand Technical 
University & UPTU) in India and created a *scholarship fund* that helps its enrolled students get 
a *highly accredited college degree* with a scholarship while at the same time get trained for jobs 
and employment opportunities under the Edoofa program.

The *Vision* that Edoofa has for the enrolled students before they graduate is to *impart them with the relevant* 
*knowledge, skills and attitude.*

• Through the Edoofa program, the students are learning the right 
attitude of *hard work and passion, gaining crucial*
*employability skills and getting precious* 
*knowledge* with a *quality academic experience.*

Now, as a prospective student you would like to 
know exactly how the Edoofa program offers a quality degree and imparts employability skills at the 
same time, 
Kindly go through the message below to understand more :
[9/3, 6:01 PM] Manjenjenje🦓: To explain more, I would first like to help you have a brief understanding of What kind of Organisation is Anhad Edutrain Solutions. 
*This is the Parent Organisation of the Edoofa Program.*,

Unlike a Common University, *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* is not just limited to the scope of providing educational opportunities to the students but rather it has an altogether separate wing under which further opportunities of Exposure are provided to the Universities.

Now *Anhad Edutrain Solutions* has two Segments, One is *the Edoofa Program* and the other one is the *SEELS Program* (Students of Edoofa, Earning and Learning towards Success)

1) Under the Edoofa Program, Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with more than 250 UGC Approved Universities in India which provide scholarship seats to Anhad, and further through Edoofa's Eligibility Criteria, those seats are allocated to the Students.

2) Under the SEELS Program, just like Anhad is associated with Universities, similarly, under this segment Anhad is associated with Multiple Business Organisations, which provide Live Projects and Assignments to Anhad.

Now what Edoofa has done is that Projects and Assignments of the SEELS Program, are further allocated to the students on the basis of their skill development so that during their course of education itself, from Day 1 they can start having exposure to relevant work experience. 

These Projects and Assignments further help students to earn Scholarship Credits which contribute towards making their education affordable!
[9/3, 6:01 PM] Manjenjenje🦓: *Edoofa Program Benefits* 


 *Edoofa: Education for All.* 
The Edoofa program is the result of years of dedication of our founders *[Mr.Angad & Mr.Avreen Singh]* 
towards solving two of the most important problems in the current education system- lack of 
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success anymore.

• The industry 
moves at a very fast pace in this digital era and students need to prepare not only for the jobs of 
today but also of the future. 
That can happen only through *real experience and exposure.* 

• What Edoofa has managed to accomplish is *unique and transformative* - providing a higher 
education that is of a *global standard* , the *most affordable* and is *highly employment oriented* .
No student or parent should be crushed by debt for wanting a better future ahead.

• Edoofa was 
built to provide a forward-thinking, world-class education that prepares students for the jobs of 
today and tomorrow.

• There are quite some few reasons for Edoofa program being the best scholarship program for 
International students:

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a 
decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed the lives of 
thousands of students. 
This unique benefit comes to all our students where they get to 
learn and make great career decisions because of the help and mentorship that our 
expert counsellors give.

● *Higher Education Concierge* (care-taker); this is also one of the unique benefits and 
valuable services that our students enjoy. No other college or program offers this level 
of mentorship which starts before the admission and stays with the students 
throughout their college journey.

All our University campuses have Edoofa offices and Edoofa campus managers are 
there with the International students to help them with all the aspects of education —
from Academic to SEELS, from hostel to food, from teaching staff to other extra 
activities, from making friends and joining communities to having access to events and 
other extra -curricular activities — *Our students rely on the full-fledged support*
*provided by our campus managers.*

 No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to 
them during their course of Education!
[9/3, 6:01 PM] Manjenjenje🦓: *THE EDOOFA CYCLE* 

*• The Edoofa cycle is basically the set of steps or stages that you will get through when getting your Application processed.* 

*🏹In the first step,* the students have to 
receive proper information about the 
Edoofa program so that they understand

when students are still in Africa and can 
happen on either call, WhatsApp, email or 
any other online medium.)

 *🏹In the second step,* The Edoofa scholarship eligibility 
check is done and interview is taken. (This
also happens while the students are still in 
Africa.) 
↘️Once the students are found 
eligible by evaluating their 
transcripts/grades and performance in the 
interview, they are offered the chance of 
enrollment in the Edoofa program

Interview Process, then you get selected into our Program and get an Acceptance Letter from 
Edoofa

the Edoofa Enrollment fees of $200-$350. 
↘️Once the student pays the registration fee, Edoofa helps in generating the 
 *Admission Acceptance Letter* (AAL) from the University/college as well as the *Visa letter* 
which Edoofa also helps in mailing to the Indian High Commission in the particular country 
for the purpose of Visa. 
↘️All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa process 
will be provided by the *Edoofa Admission officers* at this stage.

🏹 *In the Fifth Step* , once the enrollment is completed, our students rely on the full-fledged 
support provided by our admission officers. 
↘️No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to them. 
↘️At this stage,  the Students starts
to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program and start earning at an early stage.
To get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students are still in their home country and they are directly going to be connecting with University 
representatives). 

↘️Once the university sessions are over, students secure the *Admission offer letter (LOI)* from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation and 
then the students confirm 
their admission with in a stipulated time frame.

 *🏹In the Sixth Step,* Edoofa helps in generating the 
 *Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL)* from the University/college as well as the *Visa letter.* 
↘️Edoofa also guides in the mailing process to the Indian High Commission in the particular 
country for the purpose of Visa. 
↘️All the necessary help and information regarding the Visa 
process will be provided by the Edoofa Admission officers at this stage.

*🏹And Guess what the Seventh Step is :* ✈️✈️ 
↘️By this time when the Student completes
 the Admission formalities and Visa Processes, 
it is time for the transition journey from 
their home country to India.
↘️ Upon the Students' arrival at the Airport, The Edoofa team 
will be there to take the Students to their respective Universities of India.

Over the past months, I've been reflecting upon the numerous talented individuals I've had the privilege of mentoring, and your name often rises to the forefront of my mind.

11/10/23, 10:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon, Abigail,
How did your exam go? I hope it went well. I wanted to discuss the student application forms you recently shared.

*Makamure Prosper Felix* - During the counseling sessions, the student mentioned that he is not fully aware of the EWYL Program and its 50-100% scholarship offering.
*William Shambare* - The student expressed that he lacks sufficient awareness of the program.
*Makhosiwonke Alex Ngulube* - This student is currently unresponsive and also mentioned that they have not had any prior conversation with you.

Let's discuss how we can address these concerns and provide the necessary information to these students.
11/10/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the forms 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 7-10 days.
11/10/23, 11:08 am - +91 89683 22920: I think these students did not read well the messages I shared with them because those messages contain everything about Edoofa
11/10/23, 11:08 am - +91 89683 22920: I even showed you my chat with one of the students
11/10/23, 11:08 am - +91 89683 22920: My exam was fine thank you for asking, how are you ma'am
11/10/23, 11:12 am - +91 89683 22920: *Edoofa Program Benefits* 


 *Edoofa: Education for All.* 
The Edoofa program is the result of years of dedication of our founders *[Mr.Angad & Mr.Avreen Singh]* 
towards solving two of the most important problems in the current education system- lack of 
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success anymore.

• The industry 
moves at a very fast pace in this digital era and students need to prepare not only for the jobs of 
today but also of the future. 
That can happen only through *real experience and exposure.* 

• What Edoofa has managed to accomplish is *unique and transformative* - providing a higher 
education that is of a *global standard* , the *most affordable* and is *highly employment oriented* .
No student or parent should be crushed by debt for wanting a better future ahead.

• Edoofa was 
built to provide a forward-thinking, world-class education that prepares students for the jobs of 
today and tomorrow.

• There are quite some few reasons for Edoofa program being the best scholarship program for 
International students:

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a 
decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed the lives of 
thousands of students. 
This unique benefit comes to all our students where they get to 
learn and make great career decisions because of the help and mentorship that our 
expert counsellors give.

● *Higher Education Concierge* (care-taker); this is also one of the unique benefits and 
valuable services that our students enjoy. No other college or program offers this level 
of mentorship which starts before the admission and stays with the students 
throughout their college journey.

All our University campuses have Edoofa offices and Edoofa campus managers are 
there with the International students to help them with all the aspects of education —
from Academic to SEELS, from hostel to food, from teaching staff to other extra 
activities, from making friends and joining communities to having access to events and 
other extra -curricular activities — *Our students rely on the full-fledged support*
*provided by our campus managers.*

 No other college or programme has this level of 
conviction towards comforting the students and providing a wonderful experience to 
them during their course of Education!
11/10/23, 11:13 am - +91 89683 22920: I always make sure that I share the message with every student
11/10/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I'm fully acquainted with your script, and that's precisely why I considered it essential to provide you with feedback on your application forms. Going forward, please ensure that you send concise messages and prompt students to acknowledge receipt of your messages.
11/10/23, 1:19 pm - +91 89683 22920: Ma'am may we make a call at 5
11/10/23, 1:20 pm - +91 89683 22920: It's okay ma'am
11/10/23, 1:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My apologies, I have a prior scheduled session at 5:00 pm, followed by our session from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm. Therefore, I won't be able to take the call today.
11/10/23, 1:45 pm - +91 89683 22920: It's okay ma'am
11/10/23, 2:30 pm - +91 89683 22920: Hello ma'am
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When dealing with the new forms, it's essential to be extra cautious. That's why you're encouraged to make a video – because reading messages can become monotonous, but watching a video is more informative and engaging.
11/10/23, 4:01 pm - +91 89683 22920: OK so does this affect my credits also?
11/10/23, 4:04 pm - +91 89683 22920: Ma'am may you kindly check my credits
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Abigail, I'll make sure to share the updated credits with you tomorrow, right at the beginning of the day.
11/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 89683 22920: It's fine ma'am thank you
11/10/23, 4:07 pm - +91 89683 22920: Take a look at this message ma'am
11/10/23, 4:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, the idea behind the video is to ensure that students are well-informed. When well-informed students attend counseling sessions, there is a much higher chance for you to earn credits.
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 89683 22920: Okay so if they don't understand about Edoofa I will not get credits?
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No No dear. You job will be to share the video and share it with the student.
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You will get the credits
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 89683 22920: It's okay ma'am thank you
11/10/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.
11/10/23, 4:16 pm - +91 89683 22920: Thank you ma'am let me prepare ma'am take care

16/10/23, 8:51 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Abigail
How are you doing today?
16/10/23, 8:52 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the forms 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 7-10 days.
16/10/23, 8:53 am - +91 89683 22920: I'm doing well ma'am thanks how about you
16/10/23, 8:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am good Abigail. How is your mother doing?
16/10/23, 8:55 am - +91 89683 22920: She not feeling well ma'am I'm so worried
16/10/23, 8:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Don't worry, Abigail. I can see that you're putting in a lot of effort. I was reviewing your report, and I noticed that you've earned only $14 so far, which seems quite low. I also noticed that you've submitted approximately 60 forms up to this point.
16/10/23, 8:59 am - Jasmine Edoofa: This means that not even one student out of the 60 has enrolled.
16/10/23, 9:00 am - +91 89683 22920: It's okay ma'am thanks I don't know why these students are not enrolling
16/10/23, 9:01 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Abigail, are you in touch with each one of them?
16/10/23, 9:01 am - +91 89683 22920: It's really demotivating ma'am but I will keep on trying
16/10/23, 9:01 am - +91 89683 22920: Yes ma'am but as I told you some of them I'm not in touch with them since I changed my phone
16/10/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Additionally, I want to mention that 60 is a good number of submissions. However, out of these 60, there are many students who haven't even responded to a single message from the counselor.
16/10/23, 9:03 am - +91 89683 22920: Some students were so sure that they will enroll but since I'm no longer in touch with them there is no way to ask them
16/10/23, 9:03 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you remember the names of these students?
16/10/23, 9:03 am - +91 89683 22920: Eeey it's fine ma'am
16/10/23, 9:04 am - +91 89683 22920: I will try to remember and I will tell you ma'am but some names I forgot
16/10/23, 9:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Another suggestion I have is to begin anew and connect with the students using a fresh approach. Do you have friends from your home country?
16/10/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, May I know that are you in touch with your friends back home or do you have any sibling in Form 5 or Form 6?
16/10/23, 9:32 am - +91 89683 22920: Yes I have a few
16/10/23, 9:33 am - Jasmine Edoofa: How many groups do you have right now?
16/10/23, 9:33 am - +91 89683 22920: No ma'am I don't have sblings in form 5 and 6 and also my classmates already went to universities in Zimbabwe so I'm trying to share my link everywhere and ask my students to share again the link
16/10/23, 9:33 am - +91 89683 22920: U have 3 ma'am
16/10/23, 9:33 am - +91 89683 22920: But I have one main group with over 300 studets
16/10/23, 9:34 am - +91 89683 22920: Students

16/10/23, 9:46 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Abigail, see your aim should be that your students should enroll and not just submitting student application forms.
16/10/23, 9:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am asking how many groups do you have right now and with how many participants.
16/10/23, 10:28 am - +91 89683 22920: I have 3 groups 1 with 332 participants the other one with 57 and the last one with 26
16/10/23, 10:38 am - Jasmine Edoofa: That's an impressive number. Are all three of these groups active, meaning, do students actively engage in these groups?

16/10/23, 2:31 pm - +91 89683 22920: I allowed only admin to send messages so they just reacted
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: In the group, you have the option to conduct a poll where they can choose from different options. Feel free to include creative and enjoyable questions to engage the group.
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 89683 22920: OK ma'am I will try to do that
16/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 89683 22920: But which kind of messages
16/10/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For instance, you can ask questions like: "What are your career aspirations?" or "How enthusiastic are you about commencing your counseling sessions?" You may also inquire about the number of students who have completed the enrollment fees.
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - +91 89683 22920: OK ma'am thank you so much

My primary objective is to ensure he enrolls so that you can receive the credit. Would it be possible for you to initiate this conversation at your earliest convenience?
23/10/23, 1:48 pm - +91 89683 22920: He is done with his counselling sessions
23/10/23, 1:52 pm - +91 89683 22920: I don't mind ma'am but he is done with his counselling sessions so I don't know what to discuss with him exactly

25/10/23, 12:17 pm - +91 89683 22920: Maam I have a student called Tinodiwa Ncube she said her mentor is not in touch with her, her mentor is Ms Arshita
25/10/23, 12:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, Abigail. Please allow me some time.
25/10/23, 12:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Abigail, Ms. Arshita must have reached out to her today. Can you please confirm again
25/10/23, 3:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering that all of them are still actively enrolled in school, my suggestion is for you to get in touch with them and kindly request them to add you to their unofficial class groups. 

I'll be listing the names of your friends in the description box of this group "EWYL GROUP," and once they've included you in their unofficial groups, you can make the necessary edit in the description box by adding "Added" in front of their names. 

Is this explanation perfectly clear?
25/10/23, 3:26 pm - +91 89683 22920: I once requested that and they said we only allow students at our school
25/10/23, 3:26 pm - +91 89683 22920: But I have other groups ma'am which are about 100 groups
25/10/23, 3:27 pm - +91 89683 22920: I share my link during weekends since students are having exams
25/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, May I know do you share a message along with the link?
25/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 89683 22920: Yes ma'am and most students respond to that message saying we are tired of Edoofa everyday Edoofa
25/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 89683 22920: But that does not matter I don't give up
25/10/23, 3:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Abigail, if you can't get yourself added to the unofficial school group then can you get the numbers from your friends, and reach out to them personally.
25/10/23, 3:38 pm - +91 89683 22920: It's fine ma'am I can do that
25/10/23, 3:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss the video that was assigned to you during our discussion on Saturday. Could you please explain why the video submission is still pending??
25/10/23, 3:55 pm - +91 89683 22920: I will prepare the video ma'am on weekend I guess
25/10/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Understood. Well, the deadline has already passed, and now I'd like you to prioritize completing this task. Your objective is to create a 2-3 minute video where you share your personal journey with a student who is currently at home. In this video, cover all the essential points that you believe a student should be aware of before they proceed with filling out the student application form.
I want you to make the video and submit it to me by Tomorrow. Is that okay?
25/10/23, 4:03 pm - +91 89683 22920: I have lessons from 9 to 5 but I will try ma'am
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Regrettably, it's time to bring our conversation to a close, and I do wish we could have extended it further. However, we're set to reconvene on Saturday, which falls on November 4th, 2023. Please ensure you don't miss this important date.


Moreover, if you ever feel the need to discuss anything, feel free to drop me a message here in your EWYL GROUP.
25/10/23, 4:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To sum it up, here are your tasks:
1. Reach out to five of your friends and secure a spot in their class unofficial groups.

I'm trying my best to achieve what I want l gave myself a target of enrolling at least 3 students by the end of this year and I believe with God I'm going to make it failure to do that I might get blocked by my university due to fees. I want to help my mother since she is not feeling well and can't make much money due to health problems since she is a vendor. I'm also working hard on my studies as the end of semester exams are approaching and I have to produce good results. 
A.partial scholarship
B. 2000 to 3000
C.Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program) This is the most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
D. Because I'm a dedicated student who is goal oriented and fight tooth and nail to make my dreams come true without failure, I want to fulfill my dream and make my parents proud as well as changing my family background since my family is very poor and struggles a lot to make ends meet. I'm also the first born and I want to lead my siblings by example. I want to study abroad so that I get a better paying job and improve the life standards of my family as well as my community back home since I come from very small and poor village and I believe that with  Edoofa nothing is impossible. The projects in Edoofa are the other things which Motivate me to work extra hard since I know that my mother alone can't pay this fees so I want to help her.

I hope you are doing well. As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

E. Yes

Reasons for choosing Edoofa
 *Edoofa: Education for All.* 
The Edoofa program is the result of years of dedication of our founders *[Mr.Angad & Mr.Avreen Singh]* 
towards solving two of the most important problems in the current education system- lack of 
 *affordability and employability* .

• *Quality international higher education* has become so expensive in recent times that students and their 
parents have to undertake massive debt to get to college. And further, getting to college and 
struggling to pay the high fees isn’t a guarantee of career success anymore.

• The industry 
moves at a very fast pace in this digital era and students need to prepare not only for the jobs of 
today but also of the future. 
That can happen only through *real experience and exposure.* 

• What Edoofa has managed to accomplish is *unique and transformative* - providing a higher 
education that is of a *global standard* , the *most affordable* and is *highly employment oriented* .
No student or parent should be crushed by debt for wanting a better future ahead.

• Edoofa was 
built to provide a forward-thinking, world-class education that prepares students for the jobs of 
today and tomorrow.

• There are quite some few reasons for Edoofa program being the best scholarship program for 
International students:

● *Edoofa Scholarship (50-100% scholarship on Tuition Fee)* with prime focus on 
affordability: No other program offers this level of affordability. With the Edoofa 
scholarship, African students will be paying the lowest possible fees to get such a 
quality education.
 Edoofa also gets the registration fees (the fees that students pay to 
register and confirm their admission) adjusted from the tuition fees, 
thus extending further benefits to them and making their overall expenditure lower 
than any other program.

● *Earn While You Learn Program (SEELS program):* This is a most unique opportunity 
that no other program offers. >Every Edoofa Student gets an opportunity to *learn* and 
 *build valuable job skills* from the very first year of college. All of this happens right 
alongside college education. What is even greater is that; these students can earn up 
to *Rs50-60 thousand (800-1200USD)* per year in the form of scholarship credits by 
 *working in online/part-time internships* (Working full-time on a Student Visa is not 
allowed under current regulations by government in India)
This is a way that Edoofa Students are given an opportunity to self-
finance their education.

● *Expert counselling support and guidance:* Team Edoofa has spent more than a 
decade working with Indian universities and Colleges and has transformed the lives of 
thousands of students. 
This unique benefit comes to all our students where they get to 
learn and make great career decisions because of the help and mentorship that our 
expert counsellors give.

● *Higher Education Concierge* (care-taker); this is also one of the unique benefits and 
valuable services that our students enjoy. No other college or program offers this level 
of mentorship which starts before the admission and stays with the students 
throughout their college journey.

All our University campuses have Edoofa offices and Edoofa campus managers are 
there with the International students to help them with all the aspects of education —
from Academic to SEELS, from hostel to food, from teaching staff to other extra 
activities, from making friends and joining communities to having access to events and 
other extra -curricular activities — *The students rely on the full-fledged support*
*provided by our campus managers.*

It encourages continuous growth, fosters a positive mindset, and emphasizes learning from both victories and defeats. In my approach to challenges and goals, it has instilled a sense of resilience, a focus on personal development, and a commitment to fair play and sportsmanship.
