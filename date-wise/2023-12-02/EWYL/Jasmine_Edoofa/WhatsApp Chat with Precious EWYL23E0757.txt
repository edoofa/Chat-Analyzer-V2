You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now.

Here is the message -
29/11/23, 9:31 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*
You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5s of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

30/11/23, 9:12 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
30/11/23, 9:13 am - +265 885 25 22 54: Agreed
30/11/23, 9:13 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
30/11/23, 9:13 am - +265 885 25 22 54: Yes
30/11/23, 9:15 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
30/11/23, 9:23 am - +265 885 25 22 54: Ready
30/11/23, 9:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like_

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses.
I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?
30/11/23, 9:45 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session.
