 I trust you are settling in well. 🌟  Now, I am more than excited to recommence your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) program. I am thrilled to collaborate with you again and set new goals and now there will be no limitations on your earning potential.

*Dedicating just one hour of focused effort each day will enable you to achieve earnings of up to $900*. To provide you with a comprehensive understanding of this opportunity, I have organized an official *orientation call* 📞 
This call is designed to ensure that *_both you and your parents are fully informed and aligned._*
19/08/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 056 1886: Good evening
19/08/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 056 1886 changed to +91 95019 58790

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. This is to inform you that students who come to India are offered some special benefits and now you are also one of them. _These benefits have been thoughtfully curated to alleviate the financial burden on both you and your beloved parents._

To delve into these exclusive benefits and explore the possibilities that lie ahead, I invite you to a motivational call. ☎️ This call isn't just about information; it's about empowerment. It's about seizing the opportunities that will pave the way for your success story.
*May I know if 5:30 pm (Indian Time)/ 2:00 pm (Zim Time) today is okay with you?* If not kindly let me know the time when you are available.
23/08/23, 2:34 pm - +91 95019 58790: Good evening
24/08/23, 12:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope you all are in great health and spirits. Since you were not able to attend/complete the last Grant Session, I have scheduled one other session for the Grant discussion. 🎓

24/08/23, 12:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
24/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 337 3312: Good day
24/08/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening, 
I hope you all are perfectly fine. First of all, I want you to share your understanding of the Grant Letter and the FAQ. I want you to know what you have understood from it.
24/08/23, 2:54 pm - +91 95019 58790: Good day, I have read and understood
24/08/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
24/08/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 3:11 pm - +91 95019 58790: Alright
24/08/23, 3:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 3:13 pm - +263 77 337 3312: Yes
24/08/23, 3:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 3:17 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
24/08/23, 3:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
24/08/23, 3:22 pm - +91 95019 58790: I'm sure they are as grateful as I am
24/08/23, 3:45 pm - +263 77 337 3312: Yes Jasmine, we are very proud of Ruth for receiving this grant. We witnessed how Ruth wholeheartedly participated in the activities she was given.
Her participation also pushed her out of her comfort zone and became someone who can communicate with different people.
Thank you Edoofa for acknowledging her efforts.
24/08/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As her mentor, I couldn't be prouder of Ruth's accomplishments, and I am confident that this is just the beginning of her remarkable journey. Her enthusiasm and perseverance will undoubtedly continue to shine as she navigates her path to success.
24/08/23, 3:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
24/08/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 337 3312: Noted, but kindly clarify the meaning of availing the grant? Is it like drawing down on the grant amount?
24/08/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, If you will not follow all the conditions then Grant can be revoked as well.
24/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 77 337 3312: Okay. So this means that if Ruth continues with the EWYL program it means she can still get more scholarship credits?
25/08/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,⭐

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Does that make sense to you?

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

28/11/23, 3:23 pm - +91 95019 58790: Good evening
28/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
28/11/23, 3:27 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes I am indeed
28/11/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge; that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this? <This message was edited>
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes I remember
28/11/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share.
28/11/23, 3:36 pm - +91 95019 58790: It was the one where we had to upload a video doing an extra curricular activity and a video about my experience with Edoofa before coming to India.
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - +91 95019 58790: Alright I understand
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 95019 58790: I understand
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 95019 58790: Thank you
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
28/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 95019 58790: Alright
28/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
28/11/23, 3:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
28/11/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 95019 58790: That's weird because I didn't  only attend 1 webinar
28/11/23, 3:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Then how many have you attended?

I only didn't attend one where we had an annual function at Quest
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will verify this Ruth
28/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes please
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
28/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 95019 58790: I am but I am not understanding why I am not eligible
28/11/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me verify dear

29/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes

29/11/23, 3:44 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes thank you
29/11/23, 3:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The core concept of the training was that you have to share information about the Edoofa Scholarship program among students and then for the verification, you have to ask them questions. 

If they nail it, share the offline application. Crystal clear so far?
29/11/23, 3:46 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes of course
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, let's delve into the discussion about a platform truly rooted in the 21st century—a space cherished by professionals worldwide. Yep, I'm talking about *LinkedIn*
29/11/23, 3:48 pm - +91 95019 58790: Okay
29/11/23, 3:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am sure you must have heard about it. Could you kindly share what comes to mind when you think about LinkedIn? What's your take on this professional playground?
29/11/23, 3:54 pm - +91 95019 58790: LinkedIn is a business and employment-focused  media platform that works through websites. One can use LinkedIn to find the right job or internship, strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills they need to succeed in their career.
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, It's like this cool digital space where professionals hang out. Imagine it as an online hub where people talk about jobs, careers, and all things work-related.
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: You know, LinkedIn can be a game-changer for your professional journey. Here are some things you can achieve:
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: 1. Network Building: Connect with people in your industry, colleagues, and potential employers. It's like a virtual networking event!

2. Job Opportunities: Many companies post job openings on LinkedIn. Your dream job might just be a connection away. 

3. Showcasing Your Skills: Build a profile that highlights your skills and experience. It's like an online resume that everyone can see.

4. Learning and Development: Follow influencers, join groups, and stay updated on industry trends. It's a great way to keep learning.

5. Visibility: Share your thoughts, achievements, and updates. It helps you stay on the radar of your professional connections.
29/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 95019 58790: Okay, is this how the other Edoofians got internships
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, whether you're job hunting, looking to connect, or just wanting to stay in the loop, LinkedIn is a powerful tool! 🚀🌐
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This is one of the way
29/11/23, 4:01 pm - +91 95019 58790: Alright

_*Grant Discussion: Your Performance and Eligibility*_
This is to remind you that since we were unable to complete our discussion yesterday. *I have scheduled one last session for you.*
Make sure you come on time. 
I am sure we will have a lot to discuss. 

*Date: 30/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM IST*
30/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 77 337 3312: Hello Jasmine. We are following the discussion and encouraging Ruth to participate fully
30/11/23, 12:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great
30/11/23, 2:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*
It's time for your session

Kindly confirm your presence
30/11/23, 2:32 pm - +91 95019 58790: Good evening
30/11/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, First let us complete our yesterday's discussion.
30/11/23, 2:35 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
30/11/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - +91 95019 58790: Okay
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 95019 58790: I'm sure we will be like him next time
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - +91 95019 58790: Okay
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
30/11/23, 2:44 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
30/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
30/11/23, 2:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - +91 95019 58790: I have
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes of course
30/11/23, 2:49 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 95019 58790: Since I attend the EWYL calls and group sessions, I don't think it will be a problem keeping up with them.The $300 plan is also a great way and opportunity to earn credits for my tuition fees so I will keep on convincing and spreading the word about Edoofa.
30/11/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
30/11/23, 3:26 pm - +91 95019 58790: Alright
30/11/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - +91 95019 58790: Yes
30/11/23, 3:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.
30/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 95019 58790: Okay
30/11/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Our conversation regarding the grant has concluded.

It was a pleasure discussing this matter with you.
Wishing you a delightful evening, Ruth.
30/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 95019 58790: Thank you
