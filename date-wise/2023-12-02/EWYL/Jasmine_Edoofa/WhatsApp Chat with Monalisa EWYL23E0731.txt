17/10/23, 12:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before we start, I want you to answer the questions that I am sharing below:

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
17/10/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Qusn1*Dadaya High school.It is not yet connected to Qustn 2*My name is Monalisa Gugulethu Mutudza a former Dadaya High School student now an Edoofian student.l thought of sharing this message with other students at my former school.The Edoofa Scholarship Program is the program that I have seen and learnt that it's an affordable educational program.Its partnered with top universities in India to obtain higher scholarship for students.This offers internships and industry oriented training through live projects and digital internship that are embedded into the inversity curriculum.They is also a program called EWYL it helps students to earn scholarship credits to further reduce their fees.I would recommend for you to tell students about this program for it an affordable program.

18/10/23, 5:48 am - +263 78 339 4557: Morning mam how are you doing today?
18/10/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Monalisa
18/10/23, 8:47 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well dear. How are you doing?
18/10/23, 8:49 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I noticed that we couldn't complete our discussion yesterday. Today, I'm eager to have a productive session with you. Are you ready?
18/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 339 4557: I'm doing good mam
18/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 9:00 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
18/10/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 339 4557: Yes ma'am
18/10/23, 9:02 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
18/10/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 339 4557: Oky
18/10/23, 9:16 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
18/10/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 339 4557: So if I have the headmaster's number l can send it to you?

21/10/23, 8:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
21/10/23, 8:46 pm - +263 78 339 4557: Okay mam
21/10/23, 8:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
