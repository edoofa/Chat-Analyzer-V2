Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_I won't be available on Monday_*

30/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 384 2368: Good afternoon. I am Bethel's father. This is to communicate that Bethel hasn't been feeling very well since Saturday. He actually had to be admitted in hospital yesterday though he was discharged in the evening. 

He is also preparing for two exam papers this week; one tomorrow and another on Thursday. It is against this background that I request that he is exempt from his routine times with you. 
 
I hope this request will be favorably considered and granted. 

Thank you

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

*Our next session is scheduled for Tuesday i.e 14 November 2023 from 9:30 am to 11:00 am*
09/11/23, 10:43 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration.*

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to discuss.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉
