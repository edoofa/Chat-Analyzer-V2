Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.

17/08/23, 3:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.

Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.

17/08/23, 4:08 pm - +91 86993 84618: Ok thank you
17/08/23, 4:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant.

29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay
29/08/23, 4:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

My exam was fair, and my next exam is tomorrow at 10am
11/10/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, let's have our discussion quickly so that you can make the most of your remaining study time.

5 Have you written a review on Facebook and shared the screenshot with me?

11/10/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I'd like to discuss our "Star of the Month" initiative, which is our $300 plan. Let me clarify why we introduced this plan. It's designed to help you achieve maximum results with minimal effort. 

However, it's crucial to use your smart strategies when reaching out to students. Are you employing effective tactics maximizing the potential of this plan and using smart methods to make the most out of this plan?
11/10/23, 4:09 pm - +91 86993 84618: Ok mama
11/10/23, 4:09 pm - +91 86993 84618: Mam*
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes, im trying my best mam. I got a WhatsApp group
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've noticed that students are making an effort, but it seems that the students coming to us don't have a good understanding of the Edoofa Scholarship program. Given the significant benefits you receive, we expect that the students who approach us should be well-informed about the program. Do you agree with this?
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes i sure do agree
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes mam we are on tbe same page, i totally understand
11/10/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes mam, when am i expected to have shared the video?
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 4:54 pm - +91 86993 84618: I will try my best mam
11/10/23, 7:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.

We're back with our EWYL group session today at *7:00 PM*, and I couldn't be more thrilled! 🚀

So, set your alarms, mark your calendars, and make sure to join us on time. 
Let's make this session unforgettable!
25/10/23, 10:32 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you think, this is justified Tinevimbo?
25/10/23, 10:33 am - +91 86993 84618: No mam, i am sorry about that, just that I was exhausted from the long day but will not happen again
25/10/23, 10:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, I hope the same dear
25/10/23, 10:39 am - +91 86993 84618: Sure mam
25/10/23, 4:07 pm - +91 86993 84618: She is still new to me, Ashley
25/10/23, 4:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering that all of them are still actively enrolled in school, my suggestion is for you to get in touch with them and kindly request them to add you to their unofficial class groups. 

I'll be listing the names of your friends in the description box of this group "EWYL GROUP," and once they've included you in their unofficial groups, you can make the necessary edit in the description box by adding "Added" in front of their names. 

Is this explanation perfectly clear?
25/10/23, 4:11 pm - +91 86993 84618: No, mam i did not fully understand
25/10/23, 4:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have we touched upon the topic of the video that you're expected to create, which revolves around your personal journey?
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes mam
25/10/23, 4:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Understood. Well, the deadline has already passed, and now I'd like you to prioritize completing this task. Your objective is to create a 2-3 minute video where you share your personal journey with a student who is currently at home. In this video, cover all the essential points that you believe a student should be aware of before they proceed with filling out the student application form.
I want you to make the video and submit it to me by Tomorrow. Is that okay?
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - +91 86993 84618: Yes mam, i sure will submit tomorrow
25/10/23, 4:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Let me share the pointers that you have to touch upon-*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly. <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - +91 86993 84618: Ok mam
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
25/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 86993 84618: Ok mam, should my vocabulary be directed to one person or a group?
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To one student
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - +91 86993 84618: Ok mam

Can you recall what they were?

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.

25/11/23, 1:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
