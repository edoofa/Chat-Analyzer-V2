02/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 8:48 am - +263 77 280 1613: Okay
02/11/23, 8:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
02/11/23, 8:56 am - +263 77 280 1613: I'm Takunda Mbakada, the son of Mr and Mrs Mbakada of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. I'm doing my A'Level education and finalizing this year. I'm writing my final examinations. I'm looking forward to do my bachelor in pharmacy in India with the help of Edoofa scholarship. My parents are of a medium class in terms of earnings. I like soccer, music and going to church.
02/11/23, 8:58 am - Ananya Edoofa: It is good to learn a bit about your interests – soccer, music, and going to church. Do you have a favorite team or artist? 🎵⚽
02/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 280 1613: I like doing them myself.
02/11/23, 9:00 am - +263 77 280 1613: When will we be starting, I mean the date?
02/11/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: We shall begin on the 7th of November 2023 at 1:30 PM!
02/11/23, 9:04 am - +263 77 280 1613: Takunda 's parents will be doing on his behalf since he is at a boarding school, writing his final examinations and he left his phone home. So we can hardly get him to respond here.
02/11/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. Greetings, @263772801613 

How are you today?
02/11/23, 9:07 am - +263 77 280 1613: Much well madam
06/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263772801613 !

Let us begin our session with an interesting thing! Imagine a world of boundless exploration. If you were granted the incredible power to travel anywhere for free, where would your adventurous spirit take you and why?

Link: https://www.instagram.com/p/CzLHnw9hf0I/?img_index=1 

Seize the chance to explore the unexplored and write your own epic tale of wanderlust and friendship!
06/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Good afternoon madam
06/11/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Why are you late, Takunda?
06/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I'm sorry, I got delayed somewhere where I had a task trying to figure out the registration fees. I also took time opening an Instagram account to work on the link you sent me. My apologies.
06/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Imagine a world of boundless exploration. If I were granted the incredible power to travel anywhere for free, I would take my parents and siblings to Lubra valley in India. I heard the place in nice, cold air, and we could see sand dunes, camels, mountains and how the two rivers make the valley. I imagine going there by road, then walking on sand and feet going deep in sand. I don't know how I will assist my youngest sister to walk when I will be also getting stuck.
07/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 280 1613: To earn and to learn
07/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that *Takunda* is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his professional goals.
07/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
07/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Books: 1)A wealth of common sense
2) How to win friends and influence people
3) Thinking fast nd slow
4) 7 habits of highly effective people
5) thinking fast and slow. Fooled by randomness
07/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Noted
07/11/23, 1:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
07/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Great to meet Ms Sanjana and Ms Davi
07/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
07/11/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Much interesting
07/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Hope you don't crush the head of an old man.
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, no @263772801613
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It's for Takunda! Once he will come back, we will follow this routine.
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 280 1613: That's okay, madam, he will be around mid of this month.
07/11/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Let's carry on
07/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
07/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I don't know if it will be understood well, I request that the weekend activity scheduled for Saturday be done on Sunday because on Saturday Takunda and the whole family will be at church the whole day.
07/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
07/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 280 1613: It is nice to be named among other champions.
07/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I'm done, it is so motivational
07/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 280 1613: The EWYL projects program teaches us to study the prevailing world situation in terms of jobs and job skills. People or students should be aware of the situation, then learn the skills that are required by the situation.
As we go through the projects, we will be made to build good relationship with the different CV classes so as to get the required information. The more we meet these people and talk about Edoofa to them, that can also make Edoofa have increased enrollment that will in turn be rewarded to me. I'm taught to be selfreliant.
08/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Good day mentor
08/11/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, let us begin our session with  six powerful tips for transforming yourself into a dream achiever:

How does that sound?
08/11/23, 1:54 pm - +263 77 280 1613: This is great madam. May God help you and me to fulfill the objectives.
08/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good job,  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 280 1613: I did listen to the audio

08/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Project one Corperate Alliance: here I look for companies that are technologically and digitally driven. I get linked to the employees of those companies especially the decision makers. I will arrange for a meeting of these big people with the Edoofa team. All, I do with the assistance of Edoofa mentor.
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, since our session time is over. Let us reconnect tomorrow at the same time. Meanwhile, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. 🌟
08/11/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Okay

09/11/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, You are right!
The first and second companies are student-centric companies which means that if they partner with us, this will help our students as they can provide our students with projects and in some cases, even employment opportunities.
And the third company is an electric company which does not satisfy our criteria for the Nature of the Company.

14/11/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Yes I did understood the project but I think this is best when done by Takunda himself because he knows his classmates and some who did upper six last year. 
However his is writing his last paper tomorrow, then he will start working on the project.
14/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 280 1613: On the first project, I'm still searching for the companies,  the ones I'm getting, they are not at liberty to assist me, so I am still working on it
14/11/23, 1:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, @263772801613 , since you have a basic understanding of the projects, it would be beneficial to put our sessions on hold and resume once Takunda is back. What's your take? <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 280 1613: It's okay, we can hold on waiting for Takunda.

20/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 489 5439: On project 1


It is all about cooperate alliances. The edoofians are linking or connecting edoofa to any company or organization in the home land or region.. This project helps the edoofians gain networking skills, confidence of approaching companies and have good communication skills
It also teaches them persistence after rejection by any company of any sort, teaches them to try again and never have the give up attitude
The project is divided into steps or activities which helps the edoofian to complete the project successfully
In finding a company which meets with the requirements of the project, making them acknowledge the mission of edoofa, talking to decision makers in the company and arranging a video call with edoofa as well as reporting the project makes the edoofian gain credits

I can say this is what I was able to understand from project one madam
20/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great job, Takunda!☀️
20/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am proud of you!💫

20/11/23, 2:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, Takunda!
20/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As our virtual session draws to a close, remember that knowledge is a journey, not a destination. Let the ideas percolate, and may your curiosity continue to spark new adventures. Until our digital paths cross again, keep the learning flame alive. Stay inspired, stay curious, and embrace the wonders that each moment brings. Until next time, champions of wisdom! 🚀
20/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Project 2

It is the community building project. The edoofian is required to meet with friends, former class mates that have done graduating from their senior secondary level, share his or her experience with edoofa, in the process persuade them to make them acknowledge the mission of edoofa and have the zill to be part of the edoofian community
After that offer them an application Form to fill in details and apply for the edoofa scholarship program. The edoofian is credited when the applicant pays the enrollment fee and also credit when admitted at any university
This project helps the edoofians have persuasive skills

21/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Thank you so much
21/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
21/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 489 5439: That's indeed great madam
21/11/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
21/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

21/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk madam Ananyaa, I will try to connect with my friends and make a group in which I will share my experiences with edoofa and tell them about the opportunity
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
21/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

27/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Takunda we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
27/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 489 5439: That's olk ma'am
Guess the areas of the onboarding are well explained

Let's move madam
27/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
27/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
27/11/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
27/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Will be excited and feel honored to be informed of it madam
27/11/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
27/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk that's great
27/11/23, 1:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Not only this, Four of our Proud Edoofians recently landed paid internships only with their active participation and learning under the dedicated guidance of our *Career Development Officer, Mr. Anik.*💼

Here is a sneak peek of our incredibly informative webinars! 🌟
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 489 5439: They were privileged to benefit a lot from the Mr Aniks guidance 

That's good
27/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
27/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk am ready to give full focus and attention to the detailed steps so that I'll have that project <This message was edited>
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday  and Friday-  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
27/11/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 489 5439: Olk noted down madam Ananyaa
29/11/23, 1:10 am - +263 77 280 1613 joined using this group's invite link
01/12/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Attention, Takunda!!*

Our session scheduled for 1:30 PM is about to begin on the EWYL Line. Please join promptly, as punctuality is crucial. Remember, we only connect twice a week, so being on time ensures we make the most of our limited sessions.
01/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 77 280 1613: Greetings madam, Takunda has no electricity for the past two days due to faults behind our control, therefore his phone battery has elapsed. He is trying all means to charge it, maybe he will be late.
01/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, thank you for infroming me.
