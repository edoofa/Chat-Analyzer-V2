03/08/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

Aim: Understand the market I am going to walk into in the future and prepare myself at a very early stage to be well equipped.

Online mode of walking gives  great chances to connect to companies that are technologically driven and digital in nature.I would identify these companies in my country and I should be decisive when doing that.I would also create a LinkedIn account so that I can link with these companies and connect with the decision makers.I would have to talk to different organisations and human resources managers through LinkedIn and take their contacts.This will help me setup a meeting with them to connect with Edoofa and then share back the meeting time so that the company will talk to Edoofa.

Connecting to the companies would help me explore my network and  credibility which will further help on learning projects or industrial exposure and jobs in my country

10/08/23, 3:27 pm - +263 78 797 2255: *Q1*
School name: St Francis and St Clare Mission

My school is not connected with Edoofa

*Answer to question 2*
Hello dear sir/ madam
My name is Tapiwanashe Sipiyiye a student doing her Upper 6 Sciences at St Francis and St Clare Mission.I am a proud Edoofian.I  have reached you to  so that I can share with you about Edoofa Program.
This is a scholarship which offers affordable, accessible and best education to African students who wish to persue their tertiary education abroad,in India.

The scholarship is affordable in the sense that it provides a program called Earn While You Learn.Here a student is offered some credits through projects.If one accomplishes her targets on the project,she is paid some money.However,the money will not be in form of cash but rather,her school fees will be deducted from the school's account, reducing the costs of her fees.This makes Edoofa unique from other scholarships.EWYL program also offers skills, knowledge about the 21th century technology, and makes us employable.

Furthermore, university fees here in Zimbabwe are no longer affordable by everyone due to inflation and ZW rates rising each day.Edoofa is the best solution for this!


Now I am here to ask for your time so that I can link you with the Edoofa authority heads so that you can explore online with them.
In addition,I would like to ask for your help so that we can share the same about Edoofa scholarship  to the A level students at your school so  that no one can be left behind.

How are you doing today? Are you ready for your session?🚀

21/08/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Tapiwanashe!

That is alright.
21/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
21/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
21/08/23, 8:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
21/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 797 2255: Thank you ma'am
21/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 797 2255: Yes ma'am!
21/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 797 2255: Let's explore
21/08/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
21/08/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 797 2255: Interesting
21/08/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 797 2255: following
21/08/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
21/08/23, 9:04 am - +263 78 797 2255: Sorry ma'am am facing network challenges this side since the past three days.I am online even now but you might not be able to contact me due to the poor network
21/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand.
21/08/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: , There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
21/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 797 2255: Noted ma'am
21/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 797 2255: ok ma'am I will send you the usernames after creating them
21/08/23, 9:16 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday- 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.

21/08/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170



Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/08/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 797 2255: okay ma'am, impressive

21/08/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 797 2255: so we won't using the group but just the line with the above number right?
21/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 797 2255: Sorry ma'am,if I may ask.Should I do this now?
21/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: We would still be using this this group for information or any concerns. However we will be using the Line for our session.
21/08/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 797 2255: okay thank you
21/08/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we shall connect at our new session time.

23/08/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 797 2255: As far as I understand the Edoofa program looks for A level students only.But I have this other fellow student of mine who wrote his exams last year.

He is a very bright, intelligent and promising student also.When he wrote his O level exams,he had 8A's.

However when he wrote his A level,he came out with 3 points.

I wanted to ask if he is eligible since he was a very good student and also our school Captain.Maybe there was a social problem when he wrote his A level,that's my perception.
23/08/23, 9:17 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, yes he is eligible. Kindly ask him to fill out the application form.
23/08/23, 9:18 am - +263 78 797 2255: Oh wow! Thank you so much ma'am.I really appreciate.Thank you so much!

I understand. Let's consider this approach: I recommend that you continue following your EWYL ritual of saying "I am your proud Edoofian." Additionally, you can submit your assignments whenever you find the time. If there's a session you won't be able to attend, kindly send a message in advance. This will ensure that your responses are recorded, and we can keep track of your attendance.
29/08/23, 7:25 am - +263 78 317 8669: How are you mam. There had been weak network coverage yesterday and a day before. She sent you messages which could not sail through.

20/10/23, 4:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, Tapiwanashe. Let me share the essence with you in text format!

Stress management is essential for maintaining overall well-being. Here are some effective stress management strategies:

1. **Deep Breathing**: Practice deep, slow breathing to calm your nervous system. Inhale deeply for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale for a count of four. Repeat this several times.

2. **Exercise**: Physical activity releases endorphins, which are natural mood lifters. Regular exercise helps reduce stress and increase resilience.

3. **Meditation and Mindfulness**: These practices can help you stay in the present moment, reducing anxiety about the future. There are various apps and guided sessions to get you started.

4. **Time Management**: Prioritize tasks, create to-do lists, and set realistic goals to avoid feeling overwhelmed.

5. **Healthy Diet**: Eating a balanced diet can improve your physical and mental well-being. Avoid excessive caffeine and sugar intake.

6. **Adequate Sleep**: Ensure you get enough rest, as lack of sleep can contribute to stress. Create a relaxing bedtime routine.

7. **Social Support**: Talk to friends and family about your concerns. They can provide emotional support and different perspectives.

8. **Limit Screen Time**: Excessive time spent on screens can contribute to stress. Set boundaries for technology use.

9. **Hobbies**: Engage in activities you enjoy, whether it's reading, gardening, painting, or playing a musical instrument. Hobbies can be a great way to unwind.

10. **Seek Professional Help**: If stress is overwhelming and persistent, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance and support.

11. **Self-Care**: Take time for yourself. Pamper yourself with a hot bath, a good book, or any activity that brings you joy.

12. **Positive Thinking**: Replace negative self-talk with positive affirmations. Challenge and reframe negative thoughts.

13. **Limit Caffeine and Alcohol**: These substances can exacerbate stress and anxiety. Reducing their consumption can help.

14. **Learn to Say No**: Don't overcommit yourself. Setting boundaries is crucial for managing stress.

15. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: This involves tensing and relaxing muscle groups to alleviate physical tension.

Remember that not all strategies work the same for everyone. It's essential to experiment and find what works best for you. A combination of these strategies can be particularly effective in managing stress.

27/10/23, 4:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I'm also curious to learn about your cultural festivals. Why don't you add something about your cultural festival?

31/10/23, 7:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepare to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tapiwanashe and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
08/11/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 317 8669: Greetings mam.
We are fine as family and you?
As for factors that lead to success of EWYL programme according to what you shared with us:
1.Good relationship and connection between mentors and students to guide them throughout the programme
2.From song" Who made us meet", Giving it all to God. Everything needs God's guidance.
3.Students to be well vest with EWYL strategies to maximize scholarship credits
4.Stufents need to have time   to mingle with one another like fun chit- chut sessions, breaking the ice and building a sense of community programmes to make them feel at home and be part of Edoofa community. Sense of belonging will make students give maximum participation for maximum outcome .

That's our view. You can assist us if there is anything amiss. Thank you
17/11/23, 4:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Tapiwanashe!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
