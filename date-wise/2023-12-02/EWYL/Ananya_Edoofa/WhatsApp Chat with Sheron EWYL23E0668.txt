How are you today? Are you ready ?✨
25/09/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 147 2564: I'm good and how are doing ma'am
25/09/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - +263 77 147 2564: No I don't understand the two objectives
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/09/23, 2:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/09/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay understood
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
25/09/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Noted ma'am
25/09/23, 2:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
25/09/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Thank you I hope we are going to have an interesting journey, Greetings to bother of them
25/09/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 147 2564: That's great ma'am no words can justify how motivated I am
25/09/23, 2:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!

30/09/23, 9:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have.
30/09/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Oky thank you ma'am
03/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Sheron!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🏆
04/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Yes ma'am
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
04/10/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

04/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Ok ma'am
04/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
04/10/23, 2:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project. You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same.
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.
05/10/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session here. 

I wanted to share something exciting with you today. I've been part of an incredible journey as a mentor, and I'm thrilled to show you a reel that features not just me, but also some of my co-mentors.✨

05/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay ma'am
06/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay what I can say ma'am is that this project needs time and now I'm overwhelmed by the examination which are going to take place next week hence I haven't even discussed this with the local Principals
06/10/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That is alright, Sheron! Don't worry we can work on the project once you are done with your exams.
06/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Oky ma'am
06/10/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Meanwhile, can you tell me the nam of your school?
06/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Inyathi High School
06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, your school is already connected with us. Now, I want you to just search for the contacts of other school heads.
06/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Oky I will do search but there are other two schools which are local, they are Somvubu High School and Gloag High School
06/10/23, 2:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I hope you will be able to find it by this week.
06/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Oky ma'am
06/10/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay I wanted to ask that for how long have you been in contact with Inyathi High School
06/10/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Nearly from December 2021!
06/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Ok thank you for the information ma'am
06/10/23, 3:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Shalom, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Understood
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday  - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
06/10/23, 3:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
06/10/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay ma'am
06/10/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now let us connect at our new scheduled time.
06/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Okay
08/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 147 2564: Oky ma'am regarding this scholarship I had a deep conversation with the Inyathi Chaplain and he said ,yes they were in contact with you but when they got two students admitted into the EDOOFA Scholarship Program everything went well until they reached your country until that's when you started to request funds which were not mentioned before
11/10/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 961 6541: Thank you sir for the counseling and everything you have done for me as a student I would like to say Stay blessed and continue doing great for other students as you have done for me so I appreciate.My parents and I have decided to drop and kindly ask for my $200 to be refunded
30/11/23, 8:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263779616541 @263771472564 @263779126998 

It has been so long since we last connected, may I know how are you all doing as a family?
30/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 961 6541: Good day ma'am , how are you and your team . We are doing well as family
30/11/23, 7:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I understand that there is a delay from my end, however being your mentor I want to understand that what really happened?
01/12/23, 7:35 am - +263 77 961 6541: Good morning ma'am , let me explain a little bit for you , as we were busy preparing for Sharon's enrollment . We went forward to consult her school authorities and that's when they advised her ( Sheron ) about how you really operate although you were hiding some of your measures which you apply for example your tuition fees is same as of country although you say you offer scholarship at low cost but at the end of the day we will be paying full tuition fees but paid in bits and pieces
01/12/23, 7:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @263779616541 

I understand where you're coming from, and I genuinely appreciate you sharing your concerns with us. However, I believe there might be a misunderstanding and an expectation gap. No one is forcing you into anything; as your mentor, I personally want to have a conversation to clear up any misunderstandings. I don't want you to miss out on any opportunities due to confusion.

May I suggest we connect over a phone call? This way, we can discuss and understand what might not be aligning with your expectations.
01/12/23, 8:52 am - +263 77 961 6541: Ok that's fine , go ahead
01/12/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, shall we connect today at 3:30 PM?
01/12/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 961 6541: Yes it's fine
01/12/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Shall we connect now?
01/12/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 961 6541: Yes
