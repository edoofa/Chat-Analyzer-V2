May we begin with our session?
17/10/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: @263772674398 @263778324244
17/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 267 4398: How are you, @Saloni
17/10/23, 2:14 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
17/10/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before we begin, there are some important steps for students/parents to start this journey, these are mandatory to follow. Once you've completed these steps, we can talk about whether you want to continue with the program or put it on hold.


When we share the session days with you, we kindly request that if the student is available and willing to continue with the sessions, please say "yes." If the student is unavailable, we don't recommend parents proceed with the sessions on behalf of the student. However, if you still wish to do so, please let us know. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 2:16 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Let me revert once i talk to Tanatswa. She is at xool, preparing for her A level final exams tomorrow
17/10/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 267 4398: Hi @Saloni, i am failing to get hold of Tanatswa by phone. Could be network issues, my apologies. Is it possible to postpone this discussion?
17/10/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, I am completely with you on this, just that these are some mandatory formalities that need to be performed before Tanatswanashe takes over her journey the date you have mentioned on the availability of the student. I will not begin anything before Tanatswanashe is present for sessions with me. Just that these are certain basic mandatory requirements that need to be fulfilled.
17/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 77 267 4398: I understand. Will ask her to contact you the soonest, for the smooth flow of your plan
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: These are basic formalities that even you can do. <This message was edited>
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
17/10/23, 2:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

Thanks for sharing this. Its good to see dreams being turned into reality, and seeing our future leaders work towards achieving their dreams.
