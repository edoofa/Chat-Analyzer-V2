29/09/23, 8:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Friday! 
How are you doing today?

Let’s begin with today's session.
29/09/23, 8:36 am - +263 78 210 9468: Happy Friday to you too
Am doing well thank you
Yes we may proceed
29/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
29/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Please excuse me for the delayed response as I was facing some connectivity issues.
29/09/23, 8:55 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
29/09/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 210 9468: It's okay
29/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 78 210 9468: No I don't
29/09/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
29/09/23, 9:02 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
29/09/23, 9:07 am - +263 78 210 9468: I have understood now
29/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
29/09/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
29/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay
29/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 78 210 9468: That would be great
29/09/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
29/09/23, 9:21 am - +263 78 210 9468: Very interesting...am so excited
29/09/23, 9:22 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

29/09/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okayy okay
29/09/23, 9:30 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
29/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 210 9468: Yes I noticed and would really love to be celebrated.
29/09/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
29/09/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session ends at this point.
Please be aware that there are no planned meetings on Saturday and Sunday.

Our following meeting is scheduled for *Tuesday* as on Monday on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary also known as  India's Father is revered worldwide for his tireless efforts in promoting non-violence and independence.

04/10/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
04/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 78 210 9468: They are very ncouraging
04/10/23, 8:41 am - Aditi Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that you will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
04/10/23, 8:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/10/23, 8:43 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay
04/10/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Ayanda, have you gone through the document.

04/10/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things you are good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
04/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay I understand
04/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 210 9468: When am I starting the projects??

04/10/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 210 9468: Is it possible if we start today??at any time
04/10/23, 9:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: Ayanda, for that you would have to be regular in the sessions even in your exams and you mentioned to the Admissions team to complete the initial orientation sessions in the Fastrack manner.
04/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay I understand
04/10/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 210 9468: Can we start the projects today??
04/10/23, 9:56 am - Aditi Edoofa: Ayanda, this can be achieved if and only when you successfully complete the initial 15-day orientation session and have chosen the fast-track option, allowing you to continue at a later time.
04/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay I understand

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
09/10/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay
09/10/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
09/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay noted
09/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
09/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 210 9468: That would be great
09/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*AYANDA/ADITI/9OCT23*
09/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
09/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
09/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
09/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay I understand

10/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 78 210 9468: Okay noted
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

11/10/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 9:08 am - Aditi Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
11/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay Ms Aditi
11/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Aditi, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
11/10/23, 9:11 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
11/10/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263782109468 I hope that everything is clear till now.
11/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 210 9468: Was still going through the message but everything is clear
11/10/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
11/10/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Tuesday and Friday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
11/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 210 9468: Okay I understand
11/10/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
