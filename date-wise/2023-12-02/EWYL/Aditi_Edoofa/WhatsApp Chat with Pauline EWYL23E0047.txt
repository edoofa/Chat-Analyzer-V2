You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

22/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 78 345 3206: Yes
22/08/23, 2:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
22/08/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 345 3206: I appreciate that,noted and understood
22/08/23, 2:45 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
22/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 345 3206: To be honest with you ma'am I'm really not sure
22/08/23, 2:52 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
22/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 345 3206: Now that you have enlightened me all I can say is I really appreciate that and will continue working hard now and in the future
22/08/23, 3:40 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
22/08/23, 4:18 pm - +263 78 345 3206: Thank you Ms Tenzin, l will keep aiming high , working hard and being dedicated in my academics
22/08/23, 4:21 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

19/10/23, 4:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely talking to you, my student💯. Here are the pointers for your help.

You should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till their arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

) Student's journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with your counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Their initial feedback of how life is different in India how the basic amenities are cheaper as compared to your homeland (you may use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by themselves and struggling with the process. (you may refer to DSW's Help in explaining the normal process as compared to Edoofa's Process)
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.

08/11/23, 3:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Correct! Today we’ll be focusing on training you to ace this project.

08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have observed that honesty, transparency, and authentic conversations with people lead to the best results. Since you are here in India, and I am aware that a lot of you are grateful for it, the objective is to share that feeling with the things that you love in your new life. The sheer convenience of having a nonstop supply of electricity, and availability of internet that is almost as good as free- resources that were way more difficult to achieve back home, All of your brothers and sisters deserve those same opportunities.
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - +91 96719 10237: Yes ma'am. So I think that maybe a video might help. If I go around the nearby places and click a video with my experience
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's true! 
Sharing a story, even if it’s your own, is an art. It builds confidence, creative expression, empathy, and perspective and improves presentation skills. With this project, we are going to train you on all of these skills and also help you by sharing what you can actually tell them when you talk to them. I will also empower you to select students who you want to be a part of the community which will be based on your criteria of whether they are ready for this opportunity. After your training, you will be involved deeply in shortlisting the applicants before they submit their applications.

08/11/23, 3:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, from now on, you won't only be a student dedicated to community building; you'll also assume the role of an Edoofa certified student leader. This means you'll have an expanded responsibility in guiding and supporting your fellow students while continuing your valuable work in the community. Your role as a student leader is a significant step forward, and we believe it will bring about positive changes in your academic journey and community impact.
08/11/23, 3:43 pm - +91 96719 10237: I also believe that I will make a positive change in my academics and community

08/11/23, 4:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I am sharing this week's lesson with you.

Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 12:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 6:22 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."✅

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.💡

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.💥

Best regards,

27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello, good evening!🌸
Are you prepared to engage in a discussion about the grant?
27/11/23, 3:34 pm - +91 96719 10237: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +91 96719 10237: Of course I was very curious
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - +91 96719 10237: Yes ma'am I do remember.
27/11/23, 3:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Excellent, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 3:47 pm - +91 96719 10237: -make sure that my tuition fee is paid on time
- do all my projects accordingly
-abide by the school and hostel rules
27/11/23, 3:48 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 3:51 pm - +91 96719 10237: That's very true
27/11/23, 3:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:56 pm - +91 96719 10237: Noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +91 96719 10237: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - +91 96719 10237: Ok ma'am continue
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	        3/6
Attendance	5/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	CLEAR
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - +91 96719 10237: Ok ma'am,on Friday l ended up attending the webinar ,was it includeo
27/11/23, 4:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:24 pm - +91 96719 10237: Ohhh ok noted ma'am
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 
A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 4:29 pm - +91 96719 10237: Ok
27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are wrapping up this session and we will continue this exactly from where we left.
So we will meet for this chat session *tomorrow at 7 PM*.🚀
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - +91 96719 10237: Good evening ma'am
27/11/23, 4:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, you too have a wonderful evening.
28/11/23, 3:30 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good Evening 🌟
Hope you are well,

Are you ready for your grant Session?
29/11/23, 1:33 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good evening! @919671910237 
Hope you are well, 

So we are beginning with today's session, amy I know the reason of your absence in yesterday's session?
29/11/23, 3:14 pm - +91 96719 10237: Good evening ma'am, yesterday I had to attend evening prayers and I apologise for not communicating
29/11/23, 3:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand.
29/11/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming from here.
29/11/23, 3:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
29/11/23, 3:50 pm - +91 96719 10237: Noted ma'am
29/11/23, 4:00 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
29/11/23, 4:06 pm - +91 96719 10237: Yes ma'am I do believe that
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
29/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 96719 10237: Ma'am I'm fine with this table but the two last projects will be very difficult because I talked to about 3 students and they said they do not have money so they will complete their studies in Zimbabwe. I will try to find others but I cannot promise anything right now especially with the economical constraint in Zimbabwe. These are my thoughts ma'am
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand!
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: But you need to put in some more efforts.
29/11/23, 4:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 96719 10237: I will surely do that ma'am
29/11/23, 4:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As our grant sessions wrap up, let's gear up and dive into the projects to earn those well-deserved scholarship credits! Get ready for an exciting journey ahead!
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - +91 96719 10237: Thank you Ms Aditi
29/11/23, 4:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Time for today's Wednesday lesson, it covers a topic that is fundamental to your academic and personal growth: "The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output."

In this lesson, you will delve into the significance of analyzing both the inputs and outputs of any task you undertake. Please take the time to read the PDF carefully, as we will be discussing your insights and learnings in our upcoming session.

Analytical skills are crucial not only for your academic success but also for your future endeavors in the professional world. This lesson aims to equip you with valuable tools and perspectives that will enhance your problem-solving abilities and decision-making processes.

Remember to jot down any questions or thoughts that arise during your reading, as we will have an engaging discussion during our next session. Your active participation is highly encouraged, as it contributes to a dynamic and enriching learning environment.
