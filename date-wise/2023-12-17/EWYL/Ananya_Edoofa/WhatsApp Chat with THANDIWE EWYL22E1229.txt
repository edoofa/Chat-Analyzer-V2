You know, Seeing my students coming out of the airport and meeting them in person was one of the best feelings I've had recently! 

Now, I am so excited about more airport visits! Therefore, I want to ask how your preparations are going? When are you coming to India?

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Greetings maam. Im ok with the new timetable
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

https://youtu.be/-RZ86OB9hw4?si=67Pz56KNwC7OFkEe
11/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam
11/10/23, 4:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Thandiwe, tell me, what did you learn from the video? You know, this video was shared by my professor when I was a student, and this is something that really stuck in my mind this morning when I was thinking about your sessions.
11/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I learnt that I should not stress too much because this will have negative impacts on me and my health. I also learnt that exercising helps to relieve stress and socialising with your family and friends also help to reduce stress.
11/10/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Stress can cause headaches, sleeping disorders and anxiety which makes one lose focus
11/10/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, Thandiwe! Good work.🏆
11/10/23, 4:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I believe you must be aware that three of my students have successfully earned more than $200 in 2 months through this $300 plan.

When I asked them about their progress, they mentioned that sharing their personal experience through the video really helped. That's why I would also like you to create a video for your community.
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - +263 77 956 8110: ok maam i will definately do the video
11/10/23, 4:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Talking about the video, you can include the following points:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 956 8110: We are on the same page maam
11/10/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now I want you to create this video by Friday evening.
11/10/23, 4:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am pleased with your response and performance.

Take care and goodnight!
11/10/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Goodnight maam
13/10/23, 12:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

25/11/23, 2:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Saturday activity_*

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

27/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Yes I remember maam
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I remember a few of them maam
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Thank you maam for the reminder
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam I understand
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I understand maam
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
27/11/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam
27/11/23, 3:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Physical orientation i attended it
27/11/23, 3:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, let me check. I will get back to you. However what about the webinars, Thandiwe?
27/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 956 8110: I have been attending webinars sometimes its only the network problems and it may end and join the webinar continously
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thandiwe, you could have joined it from someone else's phone.
27/11/23, 3:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I hope you must have realized, that the only thing required here is your engagement with me. Is it that difficult?
27/11/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Its not difficult maam
27/11/23, 3:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 3:30 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Iam 100% ready to put my effort
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely! I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
27/11/23, 3:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope of improvement and to showcase our best performance
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Maam I would like to also request for another schedule for the calls because even weekends I go to school so sometimes the for the call arrives whilst im having classes
27/11/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Ok maam I understand
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Thandiwe. I will work on this.
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Thank you maam
27/11/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Im ready to take the challenge on maam
27/11/23, 4:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Noted maam
27/11/23, 4:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Thank you maam
29/11/23, 12:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Happy Wednesday, Proud Edoofian!_*

02/12/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 956 8110: There was maintenance going on maam and electricity was shut down and  my battery died
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Urgent : New schedule_*🌆

08/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Greetings maam im in the webinar
09/12/23, 4:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *_Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle_*

"I fly without wings. I cry without eyes. Wherever I go, darkness follows me. What am I?"

Try to answer!😄
09/12/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Greetings maam
09/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Clouds maam 😀
09/12/23, 4:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I hope you have not googled it!🤣
09/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 956 8110: No maam but  a friend helped😀
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Haha, alright! Before we delve into today's session, I'd like to share an inspiring story about one of my batchmates, Raghav Kapoor who was just a regular university student. A few weeks ago, I came across a post of his showcasing his own company, which has achieved significant turnover within two years.
09/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 956 8110: That is great maam
09/12/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Very inspiring
09/12/23, 4:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Raghav began building his small business under the guidance of multiple successful entrepreneurs and recently secured investment from one of the major firms in India. As his batchmate, I couldn't be prouder, and I reached out to congratulate him.
In our conversation, I asked him about the journey—how he initiated and scaled his business to such heights. 
Well, you won't believe what he responded. I was in utter shock. Can you guess?
09/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Im clueless maam
09/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Im guessing He saved up to start a business
09/12/23, 4:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, he revealed that there were no big connections or resources, basically from the beginning of his university years, he has been an active participant on LinkedIn—he started building connections, talking to various entrepreneurs, learning skills under them, and securing internships just to maximize his exposure. Not only this, but if he has an investor that too just because of building a quality network over LinkedIn.
09/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Woww that is amazing maam  im also shocked
09/12/23, 4:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, we are working on financing our education through the $300 plan and we will improve, but being your mentor I also want to ensure that you pass out not only with traditional peace of paper but with a lot of exposure and success. 

So, for today, let's take a page from Raghav's book. Be proactive, build connections, explore opportunities, and turn LinkedIn into a tool that propels your dreams. If he can, why not you?
09/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 956 8110: Yes maam he is a true inspiration to me
09/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For Raghav, LinkedIn was about connections but you know you can do more with this tool, like :
09/12/23, 4:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Career Exploration:*
Students can use LinkedIn to explore various career paths by following companies, organizations, and professionals in their chosen industries.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental.
