06/10/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/10/23, 2:43 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/10/23, 2:56 pm - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Delight?
06/10/23, 3:03 pm - +263 78 769 7756: I'm done reading, thank you for considering me for this scholarship.

11/10/23, 8:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Delight!

Excellent job on submitting the form! I've promptly shared it with our highly dedicated counseling team. It's essential that you keep up consistent communication with the student and promptly attend to any questions or concerns they might have. Your proactive engagement will ensure a smooth process.
11/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 769 7756: This message was deleted
11/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 78 769 7756: Morning how are you. I m personally doing very well. I would like to say thank you for so much for your support. I really appreciate it.
11/10/23, 1:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Delight,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:15 pm - +263 78 769 7756: Can we please make it after 2 pm. By that time frame I will be having lessons
11/10/23, 1:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Delight, don't worry! Your fast-track process is about to finish. So today would be the last session for that.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 769 7756: Ok thank you so much. I m now off from school maybe we can connect now if you are available
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Delight, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much. I just realised that you are forever the best and I have to do my best to be always honest with you
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
11/10/23, 3:53 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
11/10/23, 3:54 pm - +263 78 769 7756: M I allowed to ask because on the projects I only understood the one for Community building
11/10/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 769 7756: ok its fine. noted
11/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 769 7756: On some days our sessions will be disturbed since the ZIMSEC examination time table is out and I will be writing final exams from next week. *Some of my exams papers will be clashing with my Edoofa Sessions*
11/10/23, 4:19 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Yes, Delight! We will have a detailed discussion on your projects once you are done with your exams. Is that alright?
11/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK that's great. Whenever I get new applications forms filled up, I share with you here or in your EWYL Inbox
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here, Delight!
11/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much
11/10/23, 4:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, to put your session on hold, as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because _ from _ to _ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Ananya as soon as I get over with my exams.

Send it to - sanjana.edoofa@gmail.com, and ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com and ewyl@edoofa.com

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼

*_Let's kick off our session with a fascinating scientific fact:_*

 The Eiffel Tower can actually be 15 cm taller during the summer. This happens because the iron expands in the heat and contracts in the winter, causing the height variation.🤯🗼

04/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Delight!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2024 or August 2025
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much. I will do my best to expand the Edoofa family.
04/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 78 769 7756: Noted
04/12/23, 2:21 pm - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
04/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much. How about the students i shared with you before. Some of them already paid $200. So do i get credits for them since by that time i wasn't already in the Edoofa journey
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

04/12/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we close today's session, let me leave you with a thought: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs. Let this inspire us for tomorrow. Until then, take care, and let us connect tomorrow.🧠🏆
04/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 769 7756: OK thank you so much. Have a blessed day ahead
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Delight!

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
05/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 769 7756: I m doing well and how are you. It's a pleasure to connect with you again. That's new to me. I never heard about it before. Thank you for sharing it with me
05/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 769 7756: We can move forward. I m listening
05/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
05/12/23, 1:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Did you know there's a big word, 'paraskavedekatriaphobia,' which means being afraid of Friday the 13th? Some folks get spooked on this day and avoid doing important stuff. 😵‍💫

But you know what's funny? Statistically, it's not more accident-prone than any other day. So, if someone tells you they're scared of Friday the 13th, you can just say it's all in their head!
07/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 78 769 7756: I m doing well and how are you. It's a pleasure to connect with you again. That's new to me. I never heard about it before. Thank you for sharing it with me
