How are you doing today?
23/10/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 459 2418: Im good ma'am and how are you
23/10/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Zibusiso, as you know, our regular sessions are not scheduled for Saturdays, but I understand that you had a unique situation that required special attention. I wanted to be accommodating and make sure you received the support you needed by allocating that extra time for you.

However, I must express my disappointment regarding your irregularity during the session. It is essential to recognize the importance of attending and actively participating in our sessions. 

When we set aside time for a session, it is crucial that both of us honor that commitment. Your irregularity during the session not only affects your own learning but also hampers the effectiveness of the teaching process. 

Moving forward, I sincerely hope that this issue will not pertain to our next session. I believe in your potential and want to help you succeed academically.
23/10/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 459 2418: Oky I'm deeply sorry ma'am I'm in the middle of my final exams.......but I'm committed to this
23/10/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Zibusiso! However, you could have informed me that.
23/10/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 459 2418: Im sorry I should have communicated
....I'm sorry
23/10/23, 9:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: That's alright, so do you have an exam today?
23/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 459 2418: No ma'am I hv an exam tomorrow and the day after

23/10/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 459 2418: Do far so good maam
23/10/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I wish you a bit of very good luck with your examinations.🌟

02/11/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
02/11/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

08/11/23, 8:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Zibusiso!

I hope you are doing well. After continuous evaluation and tracking of our records, it has been decided that the special Saturday sessions are discontinued for you as you were not attending them consistently.

I want to highlight that you must have signed a document for completing your orientation sessions with us in order to proceed smoothly with your admissions procedure. However, there has been a significant lapse in terms of the duration. I would recommend that you dedicate yourself to attending a few sessions so that we can complete our initial orientation without any disruption.
08/11/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 603 6028: Yes I am dedicated
08/11/23, 8:54 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Zibusiso?
08/11/23, 8:57 am - +263 71 603 6028: Wooow thank you .....that sounds lovely and I can't wait to get started
08/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
08/11/23, 8:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 9:08 am - +263 71 603 6028: Yes maam

08/11/23, 9:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: Would you like to elaborate on the different projects?
08/11/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 603 6028: Yes please
08/11/23, 10:00 am - +263 71 603 6028: Project 1

I will have to identify local  Companies in my country and identify the decision-makers who work in these Companies. I also have to reach out to them and let them know about edoofa and the EWYL pogram. I would also have to arrange a call/video call meeting between Edoofa and these organizations which can be quite challenging.
Lastly I will have to sign a contract with these organizations
08/11/23, 10:06 am - +263 71 603 6028: Project 2

In this project I have to act as a super networker and a
person who has amazing persuasion skills. I will have to convince other students who have completed their A level to join this amazing platform that is edoofa
08/11/23, 10:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Zibusiso, since our session time for today is over, I think we should connect at 1:30 p.m to compensate for our sessions. Is that alright?
08/11/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 603 6028: No problem
08/11/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, let us begin our session with  six powerful tips for transforming yourself into a dream achiever:

Firstly....how do I set up meetings with these managers from big companies..
17/11/23, 8:50 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, we have decided to put this project on hold for now. Once we resume, you can begin your search. Is that alright?
17/11/23, 8:58 am - +263 71 603 6028: Yes that is alright ma'am
17/11/23, 9:04 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

I want to emphasize that this approach won't help you progress effectively. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress, and at this pace, we won't be able to complete our orientation program on time.

I hope you understand the importance of a dedicated approach. Let's work together to address this and ensure your success in the program.

Did you know that Africa is the second-largest continent, covering over 30 million square kilometers? Now, let's begin our session and explore the rich and diverse tapestry of knowledge awaiting us today
23/11/23, 8:36 am - +263 71 603 6028: Good morning ma'am
23/11/23, 8:41 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, may I ask if you were able to read the document?
23/11/23, 8:41 am - +263 71 603 6028: Yes I was able to maam
23/11/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything! So, please, go on sharing your understanding of the above document.
24/11/23, 6:56 am - +263 71 603 6028: This document explains the steps I have to go through in searching for companies

Step 1 is searching for companies online I can use some key words like recently opened organisations that help children with their education in Zimbabwe.

Step 2 is researching widely about the selected company......I can do this by finding out it's foundation, operations, objectives and getting to know it's past n present partners

Step 3 is studying the overall performance of the company and finding out how other people think of the company though online reviews

Step 4 is following the company in all of its social media platforms e.g Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok etc

Step 5 and 6
Finding out more about the founders then reach out to them ....
It's best to first reach out to managers in different departments first
24/11/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Zibusiso!

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx.

Let us begin our today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
07/12/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents! @263775722942 @263783201490 

I hope you are doing well. I want to bring to your attention that, despite several messages and reminders, Zibusiso has been quite inconsistent with the sessions.

It has been months, and your child has not completed the orientation program, even though others have been able to finish it in four days. Initially, the reason given was examinations, and I even extended my working hours to connect with him on Saturdays. However, he did not take advantage of that opportunity.

Now, after the exams, he continues to be inconsistent. As his mentor, I am truly disappointed, and I am seeking your serious participation in this matter.
13/12/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Zibusiso!

I have not heard from you for more than a week now. I am quite worried about your whereabouts. Is everything alright?

14/12/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 603 6028: Basically yes but now I. Ready for us to get the process over and done with
