Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the next semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
29/08/23, 10:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:27 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.
Kindly come on the EWYL LINE and type *LESSON*
Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

27/11/23, 2:34 pm - +91 85279 22506: Good evening Ms Jasmine
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 3:55 pm - +91 85279 22506: Yes ma’am
27/11/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge, that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $150 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 3:59 pm - +91 85279 22506: Yes , I do
27/11/23, 4:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Please go ahead and share
27/11/23, 4:12 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +91 85279 22506: What exactly am l supposed to share
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I want to know if you remember the conditions of the Grant?
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay
27/11/23, 4:18 pm - +91 85279 22506: I am supposed to maintain 75% attendance 
Follow the rules
Always be good 
Honestly l can’t still remember
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 4:25 pm - +91 85279 22506: Thank you so much I’m now fully aware
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 4:31 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay ma’am , i need to work hard to have better attendance
27/11/23, 4:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 4:38 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay ma’am
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible
27/11/23, 4:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 4:41 pm - +91 85279 22506: Noted , will make sure i maintain
27/11/23, 4:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:
27/11/23, 4:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 4:51 pm - +91 85279 22506: Noted need to improve the webinars
27/11/23, 4:52 pm - +91 85279 22506: Infact all , to maintain 100% attendance
27/11/23, 4:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.
27/11/23, 4:56 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay
27/11/23, 4:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I would like you to take a minute to absorb these figures and reflect on the objectives of the EWYL program for a while - which was to become 

A) Job-ready (via your sessions with your mentors and the constant industrial exposure - webinars)
B) Self-financing your education (via earning scholarship credits by working on the projects consistently).
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - +91 85279 22506: Neted
27/11/23, 5:05 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
27/11/23, 5:07 pm - +91 85279 22506: Okay Ma’am I’ll make sure l do so
27/11/23, 5:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Before I move ahead, May I know if you have any questions that you would like to ask?
27/11/23, 5:09 pm - +91 85279 22506: I don’t have
27/11/23, 5:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - +91 85279 22506: Yes Ma’am
27/11/23, 5:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is wonderful, Kester. I would like to make it clear that your Total Grant Amount is $450 and the total scholarship credits that you have earned until now are $1. With this, my goal is clear, to not only ensure that you are active throughout the EWYL program’s sessions and activities but also to surpass the total Grant amount so that you can cover the next semester's fees on your own, or at least to a significant extent through the Scholarship Credits.
27/11/23, 5:16 pm - +91 85279 22506: Thank you Ms Jasmine
27/11/23, 5:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - +91 85279 22506: Yes , I’m ready
27/11/23, 5:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 5:20 pm - +91 85279 22506: Thank you so much
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 5:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 5:27 pm - +91 85279 22506: Noted
27/11/23, 5:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 5:36 pm - +91 85279 22506: The EWYL Group sessions can attend them both , just need to be in the session on time.EWYL Call , favourite will definitely score that . Pending tasks will make sure i revisit them and do as required. Newly Allotted tasks will surely do them. All these can archive them if just work on them. Performance in the $300 plan will make sure l look for more students and share about Edoofa
27/11/23, 5:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 5:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, it is time to wrap up the session. 
Since we have not completed the session, I will schdule one more session tomorrow. Make sure you are on time.

Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
28/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 85279 22506: Thank you so much
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

04/12/23, 2:32 pm - +91 85279 22506: Good  evening Ms . Jasmine
04/12/23, 2:32 pm - +91 85279 22506: Just came from school, soon I’ll write and send it to you

04/12/23, 6:19 pm - +91 85279 22506: Saturday Activity 

Firstly l would like start saying I’m really greaful for the EWYL program for it helped me a lot. Special thanks to my mentor Ms. Jasmine who’s always providing me with the Wednesday wisdom and the EWYL projects and explain them very well so that all will clear . The EWYL projects have helped me on communication skills like how to speak with school heads , connect with a lot of students and mostly it helped me to be confident . It helped on how be successful , type of people to surround myself with , skills needed for to survive in this century and how to manage my time .

However , l faced a lot of challenges doing these EWYL projects like getting students who seemed to understand and so promising then they will let me down . Time management , sometimes I’m failing to make sure l do all my tasks in since I’ll be having lectures , need time to walk from college to home . Many of the times I’ll be tired and will be supposed to cook for myself refresh and even feeling sleepy after a long day . Assignments , having a lot of assignments the same day and presentations which I’m supposed to do. 

Furthermore , l have a lecture in Hindi so every time l attend that lesson will be a busy day for myself for I’m supposed to search for notes , try to make sense of it and make sure l understand . And some of the lectures are not even audible due to students making noise like there will be a lot of students that even if you try to pay attention l won’t hear all of it . Therefore all these challenges are contributing to my late submissions and not attending some sessions . And lastly every month l suffer from period pain which l try by all means to avoid by its beyond my control that even pills sometimes doesn’t work , they can work for a short period of time .

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.
