There is a session scheduled for today i.e. 17-08-2023 at -
_*6:00 pm (IST) / 2:30 pm (CAT)*_ ⏰

So, Kindly be on time. Before coming to the session, I want _you to read the Grant Letter that was shared by me along with the document shared below._ Come prepared and I am looking forward to seeing you all in the session.
17/08/23, 9:58 am - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 565 7295: Noted, thank you.
17/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 71 565 7295: I have understood that the Edoofa Grant had been awarded to honour the belief that Edoofa had in me .That is if l prove my zeal and dedication to my studies.
75% of my university lessons and 75% of my EWYL lessons as well..
17/08/23, 2:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Indeed , so thoughtful
17/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Edoofa Grant identifies and supports talented individuals and are committed to their studies and show a great effort to their academic putsuits. The grant is received as financial assistance on top of the already given scholarship mentioned in the university admission acceptance letter. They are terms associated to it which the student should abide to.
17/08/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed.Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
17/08/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 565 7295: I think it is for recognition and support of your hardwork
17/08/23, 3:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
17/08/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Therefore l should remain consistent and show my unwavering effort towards my dream.
17/08/23, 3:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
17/08/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Sure , thank you ma'am.
17/08/23, 3:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
17/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 336 0587: Yes, we are very proud and happy that she got this grant. We will continuously urge her to keep on working hard and not let such opportunities pass.
17/08/23, 3:58 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, I kindly request your attention to the following crucial guidelines concerning the utilization of Grants:

1. You will have the option to avail of either a grant or scholarship credit, based on whichever you have earned more. 
Therefore, please be informed that only one of these options can be chosen, and dual utilization is not permissible.

2. Maintaining a minimum of 75 percent attendance is imperative.
This encompasses two major components : 
Active participation in submitting activities and lessons
Regular engagement (at least once a week) in mentor calls.

3. The accumulated grant will be adjusted in the even semester. Please note that the earned grant cannot be redeemed or cashed.

4. It's essential to bear in mind that the grant may be revoked in the event of involvement in disciplinary matters within the college premises or engaging in unlawful activities.
17/08/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Noted , thank you Ms Jasmine.
17/08/23, 4:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Do you have any questions?
17/08/23, 4:07 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Yes ma'am, you said we should proceed and sign this right?
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, You can do this by tomorrow.
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

Please be assured that I am always there for you at each stage and I will not let you fall back and I'll keep pushing you to work hard🌟
17/08/23, 4:08 pm - +263 71 565 7295: Okay ma'am

29/08/23, 10:17 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning, 
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 10:18 am - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *you will get your Wednesday Lesson today*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.

08/11/23, 3:15 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Wednesday Lesson*
I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

Do you remember this?
23/11/23, 2:34 pm - +91 92893 20525: Yes l remember ma'am.
23/11/23, 2:37 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, Can you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? To make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy those guidelines obediently. 
Can you recall what they were?

Good behaviour and conduct 

Pay up fees meeting the deadlines

I dont quiet remember but l am sure these were mentioned.
23/11/23, 2:41 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Don’t worry, let me help you out on this, 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.

23/11/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Over the last few months, we've been checking how well you're doing. We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on. 
The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*.

25/11/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: _*SATURDAY ACTIVITY*_
I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*

Best regards,
Team EWYL
25/11/23, 1:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, dear. I saw your message in the chat box of the webinar
25/11/23, 2:28 pm - +91 92893 20525: *Anne Rutsinga: Spirit of Competition*

Well the spirit of competition is that which triggers us to do better than the rest , the goal being to win or achieve more.The spirit of competition though some view it toxic to team work and positive vibes .l would like to come with a different perspective.

Spirit of competition allows us to challenge ourselves and attack our fears.It allows us to cancel boundaries we set that limit us to go beyond.Spirit of competition in academic endeavours is just the best for it allows you to keep your grades .However it depends with who you are competing with and for what.As we know every coin has two sides right? Same applies with the spirit of competition it can either break or build .

Recently we wrote our sessional mid term exams there are some exams which my friend passed than me there are some l passed more than her ..The pain of being below someone edges us to work hard in those specific areas.However many people l know failed to master how to work in a competition for some lost their vision focusing on someone else's vision.

I urge everyone to have the spirit of competition in their specific areas so they challenge themselves to go far at the same time not get too relaxed in competition to an extent you lose your goal.
25/11/23, 4:23 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We are about to start our call in 5 minutes. Make sure you join on time.

*Date: 27/11/2023*
*Time: 6:00 PM* IST
27/11/23, 12:13 pm - +91 92893 20525: Good afternoon Maam

Maam
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Last time, we were discussing about the Grant. 

May I know do you have any doubts so far?
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - +91 92893 20525: No maam
Everything is clear
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:42 pm - +91 92893 20525: Following
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.
27/11/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
27/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 92893 20525: Can l send an audio maam
27/11/23, 2:51 pm - +91 92893 20525: This message was deleted
27/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 92893 20525: <Media omitted>
27/11/23, 2:54 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom.
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 92893 20525: Yes sure ,thank you maam
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 92893 20525: Consistency is key
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 92893 20525: Sure , okay maam.
I feel motivated already🙂
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Allow me to summarize our discussion. We've assessed your performance from *September to December*, and currently, you are not eligible to redeem the grant due to your past performance. *However, with one month remaining, if you actively participate in all calls, sessions, and webinars, there's a chance you could become eligible*.

Furthermore, I encourage you to focus on engaging in projects to accumulate scholarship credits for yourself.

09/12/23, 8:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?

I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
13/12/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *WEDNESDAY LESSON* 📖🤓

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

Best regards,
Ms. Jasmine
