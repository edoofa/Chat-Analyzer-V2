01/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?
01/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so elated to inform you that today we embark on the journey of a new batch of students that came to India through us, *Edoofa Scholarship Program*🇿🇼
I feel so delighted to have them all here and yes, indeed it was so emotional and mesmerizing. I was literally shivering and teary seeing all of them.
I believe that about such moments, words well short of, and yes, I was definitely short of words. There it is the moment we all have been waiting for, have a look at this.

01/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: As a reason of this, I was not able to take the sessions yesterday, but yes, we will surely resume today⚡
01/08/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/08/23, 1:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So did you see the video and picture?
01/08/23, 1:48 pm - +260 776890020: I have seen them ma'am. That's so amazing
01/08/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, and I am sure you will be here very soon!
01/08/23, 1:49 pm - +260 776890020: Yes ma'am 😌
01/08/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know if this is Lucy or your parent of your behalf?

@260776890020
01/08/23, 1:50 pm - +260 776890020: That is me ma'am
01/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So we were last discussing this document. May I know what have you understood till here?
01/08/23, 1:56 pm - +260 776890020: This was a guide to show  and explain how one can reach out to companies of their interest. It took me through  6 important steps that will aid me as I look for companies and connect with them.
01/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Awesome Lucy, you have got it pretty well but to make sure we are on the same page, can you share about those 6 steps with me?
01/08/23, 2:09 pm - +260 776890020: Step 1 was about searching for a company even if it was a startup. It talked of some of the keywords that could be used when searching online and also explained how to use LinkedIn to search as well. 
Step 2 was about studying and finding out more about the company using Google. It is about finding out the company's functions, foundation and areas of expertise. 
Step 3 talked about studying the website of the company, trying to figure if all parts of it are working well and are in good condition. If a company uses an app, I am to check out the functionality of it. 
Step 4 talked about checking the social media pages of the company, to have an idea of the activities and functioning status of the company. This is because a company which is active will always post on social media.
Step 5 talked about finding out the background of the founders and core members. For this case, I am to use LinkedIn for further insight.
Step 6 talked about reaching out to the said companies and dropping them an invitation and connection request. However this is only to be done after reaching out to the heads of various departments before actually connecting with the core founders of the company
01/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Lucy, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
01/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

Name of the company:
Website:
Name of the Contact Person:
Designation:
Linkedin ID/Whatsapp Phone Number:
Description of the company:
How did you get in touch with the contact person?
01/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 2, and the fun part- I’m sure you read about Scholarship Credits in the document- so, here’s the opportunity for you to earn Scholarship Credits through Project 1 –

1. If you can set up a Company Call with Edoofa Managers :*$2 per call*
2. If the Company signs an MOU with Edoofa :*$20*
3. If the Company Gives internship/job opportunities to 
the students of Edoofa in the future(proposal): *$10*
01/08/23, 2:16 pm - +260 776890020: When is this needed ma'am?
01/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
01/08/23, 2:17 pm - +260 776890020: Alright ma'am
01/08/23, 2:18 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any questions about this, Lucy? I can help you.
01/08/23, 2:19 pm - +260 776890020: It's all clear ma'am. Thank you
01/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Lucy, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Lucy!
01/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/08/23, 1:38 pm - +260 776890020: Yes ma'am
02/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what all you grasped from the audio?
02/08/23, 1:46 pm - +260 776890020: I understood that I am to build a community of edoofians through my social networking skills and persuasion. I am to reach out to leavers from secondary school or those who are just finishing their secondary and connect them to the Edoofa program.
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- LUCY, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
02/08/23, 1:49 pm - Saloni Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

02/08/23, 1:51 pm - +260 776890020: I will share this with them ma'am
02/08/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
02/08/23, 1:56 pm - +260 776890020: That's wonderful ma'am
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - +260 776890020: Alright ma'am
02/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Lucy/Saloni/2AUGUST2023*
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
02/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
02/08/23, 2:06 pm - +260 776890020: That's interesting ma'am
02/08/23, 2:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know what have you understood from this process?
02/08/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
04/08/23, 1:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

11/08/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you form the group, add me and then we can discuss the strategies to dwell on this project further.

I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
11/08/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/08/23, 2:16 pm - +260 776890020: So you are saying ma'am that I should reach out to local schools and tell them how I got to know about Edoofa, the benefits of being involved in the program and schedule calls between Edoofa and the headmasters.
11/08/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Lucy. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
11/08/23, 2:25 pm - +260 776890020: Since I'm in a boarding, can this be done once I'm home and well capable of reaching out please ma'am?

22/08/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the other School Head’s Whatsapp Contact? And if not I suggest you find it Today so we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for other School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates or peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.

24/08/23, 2:14 pm - +260 776890020: Yes ma'am I'm still in the queue
24/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: No worries Lucy, please be there fully. We can have proper session tomorrow.
25/08/23, 1:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you doing this Friday?

May we begin with our session🌟
28/08/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
28/08/23, 1:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Saloni as soon as I get over with my exams.
(Attach your date sheet along with this.)
Send it to - deepali@edoofa.com, and saloni.edoofa@gmail.com, ewyl@edoofa.com


Once done, please let me know.
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🌈
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Friday, till then have a great day!
22/09/23, 12:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Lucy can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
22/09/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

06/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I've noticed that both Lucy and the parents haven't been available for the Fastrack sessions we had planned.

How are you?
13/10/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I want to express my concern about the Fastrack sessions we had planned. Despite my consistent efforts to schedule these sessions and reminders, I've noticed neither Lucy nor the parents are available. This lack of engagement has raised concerns about the progress and opportunities for Lucy's  career development.
13/10/23, 12:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Active and involved parents can greatly encourage their students to excel, and I believe that with your participation, Lucy's potential can be fully realized. I'm genuinely interested in understanding the challenges you may be facing so that I can assist you accordingly and ensure a bright future for Lucy. Your involvement in this process is incredibly valuable, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Please share your thoughts and any obstacles you might be encountering so we can work together effectively.
16/10/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good day!

17/10/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Lucy will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
