You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

Let's set up a session on *16/08/2023 from 07:00-08:00 PM IST | 03:30-04:30 PM ZIMB TIME*  to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

17/08/23, 9:30 am - +44 7532 616996: Noted!
17/08/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since the time you have come to India, things have changed enormously. New environment, new friends, new culture, new discipline, and so on. And therefore, being your proud mentor, I along with the entire EWYL Team, thought to reward you for coming such a long way with us and not just this, I want that you to continue putting more and more effort to reach greater heights and to discuss the same, I have scheduled a call with you.

*DATE* - 17/08/2023, Today
*TIME* - 06:30 PM IST
*LINK TO THE CALL* - https://meet.google.com/qaq-ygie-xea
17/08/23, 1:55 pm - +44 7532 616996: Noted Ms Saloni!

17/08/23, 3:25 pm - +44 7532 616996: The group link and email!
17/08/23, 3:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Quinton, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU over *mail* in over 300-500 words. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey. Share it with me (saloni.edoofa@gmail.com) and Ms. Deepali (deepali@edoofa.com)

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call and acknowledgment of your parents on the same.

Once both things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
17/08/23, 3:32 pm - +44 7532 616996: So through the community building project from Edoofa, it has chosen to award us with more scholarship credits. For instance instead of earning $50 from enrolling a student, it is now offering 300USD worth of scholarship credits per student. Which will make it easy for me to cover my full tuition fee. Am so happy for this opportunity. Thanks to my lovely mentor Ms Saloni and the rest of the Edoofa team!

17/08/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Quinton, may I know if you have any concerns with the FAQ and Grant certificate?
17/08/23, 4:06 pm - +44 7532 616996: No questions Ms Saloni!
17/08/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.
17/08/23, 4:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride.

QUINTON EWYL23E0233

My experience as a proud Edoofian has been nothing than a miracle!

If edoofa was a person it would surely be the good samaritan. Edoofa has moved mountains for me. Studying abroad was just a fairytale for me till Edoofa came around!

Saying thank you will never be enough i will show it through my actions. Like you always mentioned in our sessions to always bring a difference i will make sure to change where i came from!

Getting the scholarship from the Edoofa team was one miracle and they decided to top it with the EWYL PROGRAM. Where i get to copy up with the 21st century movement of digitalisation!
Not forgetting my lovely and caring Mentor a God sent MS SALONI❤️. She has been pushing me to excel my limits from the word go! I have will always be great full to the whole EDOOFA TEAM!

The journey to India has been one my greatest experiences in life. Seeing the EDOOFA TEAM at the airport was so heartwarming 🥺❤️. Just as they had promised they were there for us as they had promised!

The journey from New Delhi to LPU Punjab was the best with Mr Mukund! I was laughing hard the whole time! Mr Mukund played music for us and he even danced!🥹 I wish i could redo the whole Edoofa journey again!

I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN!

I AM A PROUD EDOOFIAN!

Salute to the WHOLE EDOOFA TEAM AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home.

How are you?

Can you please shed light on this once?
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 2:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
09/12/23, 6:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.
