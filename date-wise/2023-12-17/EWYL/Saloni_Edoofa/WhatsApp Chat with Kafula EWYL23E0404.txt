This is just a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *08:30-09:30 AM* this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday.
Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
14/08/23, 8:37 am - +260 96 9125560: Greetings ms 
Hope you are well
My weekend was just okay I hope yours was okay as well
14/08/23, 8:37 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood
14/08/23, 8:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: It was great, thank you for asking.
14/08/23, 8:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, did you go through the Wednesday lesson that was shared with you on Friday?
14/08/23, 8:38 am - +260 96 9125560: Good to know
14/08/23, 8:39 am - +260 96 9125560: Yes ms saloni
14/08/23, 8:39 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's amazing, Kafula! Can you share your understanding of the same in 150-200 words?
14/08/23, 8:50 am - +260 96 9125560: From my understanding Taking small steps towards a goal offers several benefits over giant leaps. Firstly, it enhances consistency and prevents burnout. Small, manageable tasks are easier to tackle regularly, maintaining motivation and preventing overwhelming stress. Additionally, gradual progress allows for better learning and skill development. Incremental steps provide opportunities to refine techniques and adapt strategies based on feedback.
Moreover, breaking down a goal into smaller parts fosters a sense of accomplishment. Each completed step boosts confidence and reinforces the belief that the larger goal is achievable. This positive reinforcement further drives motivation.
Furthermore, small steps enable better tracking of progress. Clear milestones make it easier to measure advancement, adjust timelines, and identify potential challenges early on.
Lastly, taking small steps promotes adaptability. It's easier to pivot or make course corrections when progress is incremental, as opposed to committing heavily to a single approach with giant steps.
In essence, the benefits of taking small steps lie in sustaining motivation, skill development, a sense of accomplishment, progress tracking, and adaptability throughout the journey toward a goal
14/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Kafula, you have rightly said! You can embrace vlogging as your avenue to global impact. With just a smartphone and your editing finesse, you can captivate audiences worldwide. Consistency is your ally – share your agenda and wisdom, fostering both entertainment and education. As you progress, amplify your tools. Vlogging not only fuels your dreams but fuels your pockets – ads, partnerships, commissions.
14/08/23, 8:59 am - +260 96 9125560: Thank you ms saloni
14/08/23, 9:09 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Kafula, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
14/08/23, 9:19 am - +260 96 9125560: When it comes to my long term goals I really want to work for Microsoft or Google because of my high intellect in technology and  the ewyl program will help in doing so by helping me pay for my tuition fees when required which will lessen the burden on my parents
14/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Oh, this is awesome Kafula, I rarely see students your age aiming this high at getting jobs in Google and Microsoft. You are such clear-minded and have your eyes straight on goals⚡
14/08/23, 9:29 am - +260 96 9125560: Thank you ms saloni
14/08/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.

14/08/23, 9:45 am - +260 96 9125560: Yes ms saloni I will and sorry for the late reply
14/08/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please excuse me, no sessions will held tomorrow since our organization will be closed on Tuesday in observance of India's Independence Day🇮🇳
14/08/23, 4:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This significant day marks the birth of a sovereign India, a result of immense sacrifices and unwavering determination. Vibrant parades, flag-hoisting ceremonies, cultural performances, and patriotic fervor color the celebrations across the country. It's a time to reflect on India's journey to self-governance and to honor the leaders who led the struggle for freedom.
14/08/23, 5:40 pm - +260 96 9125560: I totally understand ms saloni

17/08/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
17/08/23, 8:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 9:20 am - +260 96 9125560: Am done ms saloni
17/08/23, 9:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
17/08/23, 9:35 am - +260 96 9125560: I was just about to say That 
but for me what I liked the most where and the motivations that where being given
17/08/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's great, let's discuss the rest tomorrow in our session.
17/08/23, 9:39 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood ms saloni
Have a great day
21/08/23, 8:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

Let's begin with our session⚡
21/08/23, 8:49 am - +260 96 6605412: This message was deleted
21/08/23, 8:50 am - +260 96 9125560: Good how are you ms
Forgive me for the late reply
21/08/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
No worries, I understand.
21/08/23, 8:53 am - +260 96 9125560: May we begin our session
21/08/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, once you go through the newsletter, please let me know.
21/08/23, 9:05 am - +260 96 9125560: I find this newsletter very amusing
21/08/23, 9:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: The newsletter was about two questions that were raised by the students:
1. How do seeking opportunities and building solid foundations complement each other in the context of wealth creation?
2. Could you elaborate on the specific strategies or approaches individuals can adopt to ensure ongoing learning, skill development, and adaptability in an ever-evolving economic landscape?
21/08/23, 9:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: The newsletter raised these two questions. Can you answer them?
21/08/23, 9:17 am - +260 96 9125560: 1.Seeking opportunities and building a solid foundation are two vital components of wealth creation. Opportunities, often arising from innovative ideas or market trends, provide avenues for growth and profit. However, without a solid foundation of knowledge, skills, and financial discipline, these opportunities might lead to unsustainable gains. A strong foundation ensures informed decision-making, risk management, and the ability to capitalize on opportunities effectively. In essence, seeking opportunities fuels growth, while a solid foundation provides stability, enabling individuals to navigate challenges and capitalize on various avenues for wealth creation. Both elements work hand in hand, amplifying the potential for sustained and successful wealth accumulation.


2.To ensure ongoing learning, skill development, and adaptability in an evolving economic landscape, individuals can embrace lifelong learning through online courses, workshops, and industry seminars. Regularly setting aside time for self-education and skill enhancement is crucial. Engaging in networking and mentorship opportunities can provide insights and guidance for navigating changes. Cultivating a growth mindset encourages resilience and adaptability, promoting a willingness to learn from failures and successes alike. Embracing emerging technologies relevant to the field, staying informed through industry publications, and participating in cross-disciplinary projects also foster adaptability. Balancing a deep expertise with a broad skill set enhances versatility, enabling individuals to thrive amidst changing economic dynamics.
21/08/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your response effectively highlights the importance of both seeking opportunities and building a solid foundation for wealth creation. They emphasize that opportunities drive growth, but a strong foundation is necessary for sustainability. You have also provided practical advice on lifelong learning, networking, and adaptability, showcasing a well-rounded understanding of the topic. Overall, a well-written and insightful response.
21/08/23, 9:35 am - +260 96 9125560: Thank you ms saloni
21/08/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know how is your admission process going?
21/08/23, 9:43 am - +260 96 9125560: It's going on well but slow mostly because my mother is still trying to gather the remaining balance
21/08/23, 3:24 pm - +260 96 9125560: I most certainly will ms saloni
22/08/23, 8:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

22/08/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know how is your mother arranging for money?
22/08/23, 8:42 am - +260 96 9125560: She is waiting for a payment to come through
22/08/23, 8:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay and may I know who all are there in your family once more?
22/08/23, 8:47 am - +260 96 9125560: There's me ,my older brother James, my small sister Mapalo and my mother
22/08/23, 8:55 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I understand.

What about your father, if I may ask?
22/08/23, 8:58 am - +260 96 9125560: My mother and father separated when I reached the 6th grade
And there's not that much of communication between us
22/08/23, 9:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, I am sorry to know about that.
22/08/23, 9:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: I hope it is alright to you if we talked about him.
22/08/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Kafula?
22/08/23, 9:01 am - +260 96 9125560: There's no problem
22/08/23, 9:02 am - +260 96 9125560: It sounds very exciting ms saloni
22/08/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
22/08/23, 9:11 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood ms saloni
22/08/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
22/08/23, 9:16 am - +260 96 9125560: I understand ms saloni
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: Imagine that you are a wizard, and you possess a magical spell that can transform your life and empower you to achieve your dreams. This spell is simple yet powerful, and all you have to do is recite a few words every day. By chanting *"I am a proud Edoofian"* on the EWYL group, you will activate this spell and unlock a world of possibilities.
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: As an Edoofian, you are part of a special community of people who share a common goal - to achieve success and advance in life. By repeating this affirmation every day, you are reminding yourself of your purpose, your mission, and your identity as an ambitious and driven individual. You are telling the universe that you are proud of who you are, and that you are ready to take on any challenge that comes your way.
But this affirmation is more than just words. It is a symbol of your commitment to your dreams, your passion for learning, and your desire to make a difference in the world. It is a way to connect with your fellow Edoofians, to share your struggles and your triumphs, and to support each other on your journey to success.
22/08/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: So every day, when you recite these words, feel the power and the magic that they contain. Visualize yourself as a proud Edoofian, standing tall and strong, with the world at your feet. Let this affirmation fill you with confidence, hope, and with the knowledge that you are part of something special. And watch as your life transforms before your eyes, as you become the best version of yourself, and as you achieve everything you have ever wanted.
22/08/23, 9:29 am - +260 96 9125560: I truly mean it when I say that I am a proud edoofian🙇🏽‍♂️

In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

a)Nature of company

12/09/23, 9:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, let me pen my thoughts down.

14/09/23, 9:24 am - +260 96 9125560: What I have understood from the is that community building refers to the process of establishing and gathering connections,relationships and sharing identities among individuals within a particular group or community, this involves creating a supportive place where individuals have a sense of belonging and are able to communicate , collaborate and work towards common goals 
The goal of community building is to foster a positive and cohesion community that malt's social interaction and participation in a shared sense of responsibility and honourship towards achieving success 
And the outline of this project is for students to double up networking and persuasion skills and learn how to give african children to get into the edoofian educational eco system and acquire international education that prepares them for future
This project also encourages students who have mindset identified opportunities and sharing them openly to creating an impact on the life of others
To successfully complete this project students are required to reach out to African students who have recently graduated from the senior secondary schools , completed their senior secondary education or are currently in the final year of their senior secondary education ,by doing this students with earn some scholarship credits
14/09/23, 9:27 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Kafula, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

17/09/23, 8:01 pm - +260 96 9125560: Ms saloni I hope you are doing well 
I just wanted to inform you that I won't be able to make the session tomorrow

19/09/23, 8:41 am - +260 96 9125560: Am doing just fine 
Hope you are doing 

Yes let us begin our session
19/09/23, 8:41 am - +260 96 9125560: I am a proud edoofian
19/09/23, 8:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
19/09/23, 8:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: How is your process going Kafula?
19/09/23, 8:45 am - +260 96 9125560: Its going okay
I am just waiting for the passport to be out
19/09/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!

When are you expected to come to India?
19/09/23, 8:47 am - +260 96 9125560: For now am not really sure ms saloni
But I think before this month ends or in the first weeks of October
19/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Wow, I am so excited to think of you here finally!
19/09/23, 8:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: Coming to this, can we move forward from this point?
19/09/23, 8:49 am - +260 96 9125560: Yes ms saloni
19/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
19/09/23, 8:51 am - +260 96 9125560: I understand ms saloni
19/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
19/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Kafula/Saloni/19SEPT2023* <This message was edited>
19/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
19/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
19/09/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
19/09/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
19/09/23, 8:56 am - +260 96 9125560: I have a query ms saloni
19/09/23, 9:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, please share.
19/09/23, 9:01 am - +260 96 9125560: When should I create this group?
19/09/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you have to create this group.
19/09/23, 9:02 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood so when should I do it
19/09/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: You can do that after the session.
19/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
19/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
19/09/23, 9:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

19/09/23, 9:22 am - +260 96 9125560: The last project gives the students an  opportunity to make there teachers proud by telling them how lucky they are to qualify for the edoofa programme
As apart of this project I will reach out to local schools in my region and inform them about the edoofa programme
When I get into contact with my former school I can simply educate  the principle about the the edoofa programme and ask him to set up a meeting with edoofa directors
19/09/23, 9:23 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:

You will introduce yourself, and share with them how you got the scholarship and what your future aspirations are.​
​​
​After that, you will share in detail about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.

19/09/23, 9:27 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood ms saloni
19/09/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Kafula- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
19/09/23, 9:32 am - +260 96 9125560: Understood ms saloni
19/09/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
19/09/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
19/09/23, 9:34 am - +260 96 9125560: Yes I am ms saloni

19/09/23, 9:37 am - +260 96 9125560: Have a nice day ms saloni
20/09/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Dear Students and Parents,

Please rest assured that I am fully committed to providing you with a great learning experience, and I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. 🙌

21/09/23, 8:45 am - +260 96 9125560: Good to hear ms saloni
21/09/23, 8:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
21/09/23, 8:47 am - +260 96 9125560: Yes ms saloni
21/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now we are ready to begin a new journey🎯
21/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please choose your batch for your sessions. Either it has to be 
*MONDAY and THURSDAY*
or 
*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (that will be happening on the days you will choose), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
21/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

09/10/23, 6:51 pm - +260 96 9125560: Good evening ms
Hope you are doing well
I wanted to tell you that I have a query
23/10/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Kafula!
How are you?
23/10/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM 😊 Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.
