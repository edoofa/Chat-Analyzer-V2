I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
19/09/23, 12:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

20/09/23, 12:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you're having a good day.

I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

While I recall discussing your role as a nurse with me, I couldn't locate the specific conversation where you mentioned your unavailability on Wednesdays and the need to take a leave on Thursdays for our sessions. If I had been aware of this, I would have certainly scheduled our sessions on Thursdays to accommodate your preferences and plan accordingly. Thank you for your patience and consideration.

11/10/23, 11:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Panashe will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

12/10/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
12/10/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

26/10/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What I feel is Zimbabwe and India, despite their geographical and cultural differences, share certain similarities in their festive traditions. Both countries celebrate major festivals with vibrant colors, music, and a strong sense of community. In India, festivals like Diwali and Holi involve lighting lamps, exchanging sweets, and playing with colorful powders, while in Zimbabwe, events like the Harare International Festival of the Arts (HIFA) showcase traditional music, dance, and visual arts, bringing people together. Both nations also celebrate various agricultural festivals, reflecting the importance of farming in their societies. Additionally, the idea of family and community bonding is central to both countries' celebrations, emphasizing the significance of togetherness during these festive occasions.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
