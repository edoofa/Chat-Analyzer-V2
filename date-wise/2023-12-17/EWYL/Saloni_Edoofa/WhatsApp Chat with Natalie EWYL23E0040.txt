11/08/23, 2:13 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 341 1286: It’s talking about the project and the objectives. Understanding the objectives of the project and being able to identify companies online that is the LinkedIn platform. I will be talking to managers to set up meetings with Edoofa.
11/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks, Natalie. I’m happy with your understanding.
11/08/23, 2:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details.

16/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted ma’am
17/08/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session⚡
17/08/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Good and you ma’am
17/08/23, 1:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
17/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Natalie, now that we’ve both summarized our understanding of the project, I think we’re ready to move to the next project!* This project is quite possibly a student favorite! So, now I am going to share another audio file and we’ll follow the same process- you ensure you don’t miss anything in it and use this time to play this audio more than once, let’s get to it Natalie!
17/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
17/08/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted ma’am
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Okay
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Natalie/Saloni/18Aug2023*
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
18/08/23, 2:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
18/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Noted
18/08/23, 2:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺

22/08/23, 2:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yesterday, I could not express my condolences on the loss of your loved ones. How did this all happen?
22/08/23, 2:01 pm - +263 71 341 1286: He was diabetic
22/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am sorry for your loss Natalie, I hope you and your family are keeping strong.
22/08/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May his soul rest in peace!
22/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Thank you ma’am ❤️

22/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes please
22/08/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So did you form the group that we have last discussed?
22/08/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I actually wanted to ask that am I supposed to create another one and delete the last one?
22/08/23, 2:17 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Last one, have you created one already?
22/08/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I had created one
22/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 71 341 1286: <Media omitted>

23/08/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
Please excuse me for the delay, got occupied in an urgent call.
23/08/23, 1:46 pm - +263 71 341 1286: I’m alright and yourself
23/08/23, 1:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
23/08/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
23/08/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

23/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Along with this share the following information ABOUT Edoofa with them:
23/08/23, 2:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - EDOOFA -Education For All.
23/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
23/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
23/08/23, 2:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

23/08/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 341 1286: This project requires me to reach out to local schools in my region. I can reach out to my school principal and tell her about why I joined Edoofa. I can also share my future plans and also what the program is about. I can share my principal’s contact with you after setting up a meeting through google.
23/08/23, 2:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that’s bang-on! I couldn’t have asked anyone to explain it better than you have- so, congratulations Natalie. However, I’d still like to ask- are there any questions you have about this project?
23/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Not yet ma’am
23/08/23, 2:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.

28/08/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So how did the elections go in Zimbabwe?
28/08/23, 1:54 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Not as expected 😂😂
28/08/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Why is that so, tell me what unexpected happen?
28/08/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 341 1286: 😂 people wanted change and another party 
So we didn’t expect the exist political party to win because we are fed up
28/08/23, 2:07 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Why do you want to change and what is reason of being fed up?
28/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Because the economy is down and he’s not doing anything about it 
Prices and US rate is rising everyday 
Low salaries
Stores want US dollars when that’s not our currency ,because the money we are using is just paper 
So people wanted a change of governance,a new person but I guess not everyone wanted that cause those that are in current political party are benefiting more
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Oh I see, so the elections are over now?
28/08/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 341 1286: Yes they are over now

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩.

We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

15/09/23, 12:42 pm - +263 71 341 1286: My name is Natalie Kamangira. I am 18 years old and an upper six student at Girls High School Harare Zimbabwe. I am the deputy headgirl at my school and I got the opportunity of being at the Presidential inauguration. It was an important function and many other pupils were invited as well. I got to witness the inauguration and listened to motivating speeches. As students we managed to have a conversation with ministers and the president himself. As the student board we also contributed to the curriculum review and were able to point out our concerns with the current curriculum. We managed to tell about the child feeding scheme where by children in rural areas get food in schools as they can’t afford any food in their various household. This was an amazing experience as we shared ideas and managed to directly talk to such influential people. 
To my fellow Edoofians continue working hard and enjoy the university journey. I hope to join you guys soon and also make my own memories. We can all make it if we put our minds to it. 
Thank you!
