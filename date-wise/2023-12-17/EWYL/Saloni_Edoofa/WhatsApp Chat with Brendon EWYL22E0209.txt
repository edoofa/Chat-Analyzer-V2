How are you doing?

I just had to share my excitement – meeting my students at the airport and seeing their faces in person was such an amazing feeling🤩

Now, I can't help but look forward to more airport meetups. So, I'm curious, how are your plans coming along? 
When will you be joining us in India?
I'm really looking forward to it and can't wait to see you here!

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
