Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let's begin with our session👏🏼

I want to begin the session by asking if you have understood the $300 Training document well?
15/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 98213 46705: Yes l understood the document well
15/11/23, 2:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Fanuel, now that we have finished with our training on the $300 plan, you act as a student ambassador for the Edoofa student community. With this empowerment and power, I want to notify you that as a part of your acknowledgment, the Department of Student Welfare will share an undertaking with you that you have to sign denoting that you have understood it.

And post your signature on the understanding that will happen in the coming days, you will be given the certificate stating that you are our *Edoofa Certified Student Leader*🏆
15/11/23, 2:55 pm - +91 98213 46705: Okay ma'am, thank you .I will do that
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That will be great!
15/11/23, 3:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Fanuel, can you share the progress you have made on the $300 plan so far?
15/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

1) Regular attendance at school

We've been keeping an eye on whether you're showing up for our weekly calls, and webinars, and completing the tasks I've given you, like submitting reviews, usernames, testimonial videos, and so on.
23/11/23, 2:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the students who can use their grant amount this semester*

23/11/23, 3:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, I wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn the maximum amount of scholarship credits.

23/11/23, 3:12 pm - +91 98213 46705: Okay ma'am
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 98213 46705: Can you elaborate more as a percentage
23/11/23, 3:13 pm - +91 98213 46705: I am a bit confused
23/11/23, 3:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is the criterion that we have set for basic performance.
23/11/23, 3:22 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, if I talk about you, Right now, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount.

24/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 98213 46705: Okay but before that l have a question,  do you allow me to ask
24/11/23, 3:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes of course go on!
24/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 98213 46705: On the just happened orientation programme l was told to stand and and it was said that l had attended all the sessions together with this girl at our university and by the criteria you sent it is contradicting .So l would want to ask if it was some sort of propaganda to motivate other students or because it is very confusing and demotivating l might say
24/11/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I can understand that Fanuel and I feel so disheartened to hear that you are feeling so but Fnauel when you were appreciated in the orientation it was for your EWYL Sessions and let me tell you that you have attended most of the sessions but you  lost your points for your attendance in webinars. It is 3 out of 6.
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 98213 46705: Ma'am but most and all are different quoting to what was said , can you imagine that other students clapped hands for me only to discover that l am told that l haven't even reached the 75% and l remember missing just one or two webinars , l attend most of them
24/11/23, 3:31 pm - +91 98213 46705: But it's ok though
24/11/23, 3:33 pm - +91 98213 46705: I am willing that we work together in the next 30 days
25/11/23, 12:09 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Fanuel!

25/11/23, 5:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
28/11/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good afternoon Fanuel,

I trust this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in our schedule. Since I have a family event tomorrow, I need to reschedule our *EWYL Group session* for *today from 07:00 PM to 07:45 PM*. I hope this adjustment is convenient for you. Your participation is highly valued, and I look forward to our session later. If you have any concerns or conflicts, please feel free to let me know🚀
28/11/23, 8:48 am - +91 98213 46705: Good morning ma'am
28/11/23, 8:48 am - +91 98213 46705: It's okay thank you
28/11/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: Fanuel for this. I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
28/11/23, 11:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/11/23, 2:54 pm - +91 98213 46705: Good evening
28/11/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: May we begin with our weekly EWYL Group session?
28/11/23, 3:38 pm - +91 98213 46705: Ok ma'am we can begin
28/11/23, 3:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What do you think about this Fanuel?
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 98213 46705: It seems like a good plan
28/11/23, 3:49 pm - +91 98213 46705: I will see if l can work on it
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.
28/11/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
28/11/23, 4:20 pm - +91 98213 46705: Thank you very much
28/11/23, 4:21 pm - +91 98213 46705: I will share my ideas
29/11/23, 8:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Fanuel!
How are you?
29/11/23, 8:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please feel free to share your thoughts with me, I am always there and I wish to see you at greater heights.
29/11/23, 12:15 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello my Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Time for today's Wednesday lesson, it covers a topic that is fundamental to your academic and personal growth: "The Power of Analysis: Unleashing Your Potential Through Input-Output."

08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:

1. I believe that if you perform well, you can definitely become eligible for the grant, but I want to know the points where you believe you are left behind and still are not eligible for the grant?
2. What do you think are the areas you would have to work harder to cross that line and get you to be eligible for the grant?
3. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that. May I know what targets have you set for yourself in terms of the number of forms you are planning to share in December and your goal scholarship credits for yourself?
08/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would request you to share your thoughts on the same before 9 PM today so that we can discuss accordingly🚀

You will be provided with a form by one the proud edoofians whom you are connected to and they will submit the forms to their mentors  then after that  the Edoofians career counsellors will reach out to and you begin your counselling and you eligibility test for  the scholarship program 



2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?

I choose edoofa program over other agents because it is one of the organised and well arranged program . I have witness their  caring their applicants , they assist us the proud edoofian with visa ticket  bookings , their ones who will also be the ones waiting for us at the airport  after a long journey from home  ,to take us to our respective university .

to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.

09/12/23, 5:03 pm - +91 98213 46705: This is a draft of how l would communicate with the students of how l would tell them about edoofa
09/12/23, 5:03 pm - +91 98213 46705: The main issue of the communication with the students is that most of the people in Zimbabwe don't trust social media communication so it takes a while to convince a student and their parents to be precise
09/12/23, 5:05 pm - +91 98213 46705: I have no target exactly but l am trying to reach out to as many students as l can ,that because l am not on the ground so there is limited interaction with people and also time
09/12/23, 5:06 pm - +91 98213 46705: My mobile failed to install the LinkedIn application

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
13/12/23, 1:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Happy Wednesday!*

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi

14/12/23, 8:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good evening,  Fanuel!

Well, December is coming to an end, and the grant eligibility mystery is soon going to be revealed.  As per your performance track shared in the group, we can note that as of November, you are not eligible for the grant but, let me remind you, that you are way too close to *become eligible and hold that victory light*. For this, we both must know on how is the progress going through these short assessments:

⭕ I am sure as discussed, we planned on making weekly targets. May I know how you plan this week in terms of the number of forms you will be sharing and target scholarship credits for December after you see your performance table?

*Always remember that if you can dream it, you can do it*. Looking forward to your response.
