How are you?
14/09/23, 4:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Tadiwanashe, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45 - 07:30 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This will begin, starting from tomorrow onwards.
*Be ready🔥*

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to express my disappointment that you were unable to join our call last Saturday. During that meeting, we took significant strides in improving communication for our community-building project, addressing important points.

Before we move forward with our upcoming session with the EWYL Group scheduled for today from *06:45-07:30 PM*, I kindly request that you _provide a reason for your absence on Saturday. Once we have your explanation, I'll be happy to share a concise summary of what was discussed during the call, as well as our progress on the task list._

I look forward to your response and our continued collaboration.
25/10/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 555 2554: Please see below response from. Tadi
25/10/23, 11:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am unable to see it.
25/10/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 555 2554: Good afternoon Ms Saloni. I am well and trust that you are well too. Ma'am as I have explained and so has my mum on several occasions I currently do not have a handset so I am not on WhatsApp. I have to rely on mum to relay msgs and sometimes through no fault of hers these msgs are late. In as much as I understand and much  appreciate your best intentions and interest for me I honestly cannot do anything about certain EWYL activites because I do not have the means to participate at the moment.  I do not mean to solicit any angst or invective reprimands as that would only serve to distract me from my main agenda for being in India. I understand that as a member of Edoofa I have to participate in these extra carricular activities and I shall as soon as I have all my ducks well lined up.
I am genuinely grateful to Edoofa for aligning me with this opportunity and mostly to my mum for the sacrifices she's made for me to be here. So far as the universe will have it I have faced one incidental challenge after another but these are far from being deterents.  My phone just stopped working sometime end of August and now 2 weeks ago my iPad which was my workspace for my entire A level with no issues at all packed up!  My mum is working towards getting me a new iPhone as it is the only device that will allow me to retrieve even my current uni work from the cloud. In as much as Edoofa 'oversees my welfare'  it does not cover these aspects. I ask you to please just give my mom and I space to sort ourselves out and when I'm back on track I shall be more imteractice.
I trust this will be most perspicuous and allays any queries you might have had. 
PS : Saturdays I enrolled for makeup lessons so I'm normally not available between 0900 and about 1730 which is the time I get back to my PG
25/10/23, 12:01 pm - +263 77 555 2554: Copied and pasted it. Apologies it might have been delayed by network issues

We can't wait to see you there! 👋📞🤗
04/11/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: I genuinely empathize with her current situation, and I truly understand the circumstances. My concern, however, is rooted in the fact that she is an exceptionally bright student, and it saddens me that we haven't had the chance to interact for a whole month. I wonder if there might be a possibility for her to connect using a friend's device, as I believe she is missing out on valuable learning opportunities.

08/11/23, 12:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Also, as discussed with the DSW Team, you had a discussion with them regarding your pending tasks. May I know the updates on the same?
08/11/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 555 2554: Afternoon Ms Saloni. Tadi has told me of this $300 plan and to be honest I'm not so sold on this idea of Tadi playing  a sort of sales and marketing role in behalf of Edoofa.
I have no problem her or even myself  sharing what we know and what we have actually experienced so far. I actually have no problem acknowledging Edoofa's role in engaging us with the idea of India as a tertiary education destination. That's why I was willing to pay the $350 agency fee to Edoofa. However I genuinely just feel we are being boxed into a position where we have to play a continuous role in selling the Eddofa package. As I  understood the EWYL programme when it was mentioned to us at the beginning of our engagement with Edoofa I believed it was a voluntary prgramme with no prescribed targets or workload except to fulfil I think it was 70% of tasks if I remember correctly which at that time I thought were related to Tadi's tertiary education but as it turns out that is not the case.
Please don't get me wrong I am grateful to Edoofa but I just don't want Tadi to feel 'bonded', as if she's paying dues of some sorts. And also I would want her not be compelled to embellish her sentiments and thoughts  just to fit in to a prescribed thought process.
08/11/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 555 2554: I would appreciate it if maybe someone from Eddofa can directly contact me so we can discuss some of my concerns. Thank you. And please knkw that I genuinely appreciate your efforts
08/11/23, 3:25 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

How are you?
15/11/23, 12:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, I have shared the link with her.
15/11/23, 4:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.
