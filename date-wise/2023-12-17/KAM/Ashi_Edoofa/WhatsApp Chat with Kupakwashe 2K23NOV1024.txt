01/12/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, thankyou for sharing all the documents with us.
01/12/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/12/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Let's start!
01/12/23, 8:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Done!
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
01/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
01/12/23, 8:44 pm - +263 78 008 5885: It's clear
01/12/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
01/12/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/12/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
01/12/23, 8:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope you are following?
01/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes let's proceed!
01/12/23, 9:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps-
01/12/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $1000.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/12/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
01/12/23, 9:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
01/12/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 008 5885: I understand that!
01/12/23, 9:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/12/23, 9:24 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Sure we can start
01/12/23, 9:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Let me share all the videos with you

01/12/23, 9:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/12/23, 9:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
02/12/23, 7:41 am - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Kupakwashe, I hope you are doing well. 

In reference to our yesterday's session, May I please know if you have taken a note of the videos we shared with you?

If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
02/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 008 5885: In this video l heard that l should be open minded and l should follow instructions as well so as to earn scholarship credits.
02/12/23, 10:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: Yes @263780085885 , that is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
02/12/23, 10:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
02/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 008 5885: Ok ok!
02/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 008 5885: Clear!
02/12/23, 10:27 am - Ashi Edoofa: Looking forward for your response for rest of the videos
02/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 008 5885: In this second video the founders are clearly pointing out their vision to make the lives of Edoofians upright and for them to be positive in every aspect of their education .
Also to prepare them to be employable. Also to listen to everything counselors says!
02/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 008 5885: I'm sorry for late replies my phone has been off since morning.
02/12/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's fine dear, Let's continue with our session
02/12/23, 2:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You can share your insights with us and then we will proceed ahead
02/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 78 008 5885: In this video l understand that Edoofa has good choice of Universities which are conducive for students!
02/12/23, 2:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
02/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
02/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 008 5885: In this video lm informed on the importance of the SOP and how it should be written so as to aquire a good Scholarship!
02/12/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
02/12/23, 2:17 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
02/12/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes ma'am
02/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 78 008 5885: I understand!
02/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
02/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 1:00 PM.
02/12/23, 2:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier.

04/12/23, 7:14 am - +263 78 008 5885: This is the Edoofa Statement of Purpose which I send yesterday on Google
04/12/23, 12:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Kupakwashe, I hope you had a good weekend!

Thank you for sharing your response for the SOP form, we have received your response as well in our records. With this, I would like to know if you have completed the academic interview questions?
04/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Thank you ma'am lm now preparing to send the academic interview questions.
04/12/23, 12:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263780085885, Once you complete the document please share your response with us..
04/12/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 008 5885: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 008 5885: 2. Please elaborate on the difference between Rights and Duties and give a further explanation of the difference in human rights and civil rights.

Rights are things that you are legally entitled to, while duties are things that you are legally obligated to do. Rights are often seen as positive while duties are seen as negative.However, both are important in creating a just and fair society.For example the right to free speech is seen as positive because it allows people to express themselves freely.Whilst the duty to pay taxes is seen as negative as it requires people to give up their money.But both are necessary for a functioning society. As for the difference between human rights and civil rights, human rights are considered to be universal as they apply to all people regardless of nationality or citizenship.Civil rights on the other hand are specific to a particular country or jurisdiction and may vary from place to place.

3.What is the difference between a prosecutor and an attorney?

There are a few key differences between prosecutors and attorneys. First, prosecutors work for the government, while attorneys can work for either the government or private clients. Second, prosecutors have the responsibility of deciding whether or not to press charges against someone, while attorneys defend their clients against those charges. Also, prosecutors have the burden of proof in a criminal case, meaning they must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty. On the other hand, attorneys have the responsibility of presenting a strong defense for their clients. 
Certainly! Another key difference between prosecutors and attorneys is their approach to a case. Prosecutors have the goal of obtaining a conviction, while attorneys have the goal of protecting their client's rights and interests. This often leads to different strategies being used by each side. For example, a prosecutor may try to build a strong case against the defendant by using evidence and testimony to prove guilt, while an attorney may try to challenge the evidence or discredit the testimony in order to create reasonable doubt.

4. Which branch of law are you most interested in persuing civil, corporate or criminal and why?

I'm interested in persuing civil law. Civil law is the branch of law which deals with non criminal disputes between individuals, business or organisations. These disputes include things like branch of contract, personal injury, property damage and more.lm interested in this branch of law as l would help to resolve these disputes.Also civil law is a very broad area of law that covers a wide range of topics. This means that they are many different career paths that can be persued after graduation.Also civil law is often less adversarial than other areas of law, which can make it more enjoyable and rewarding field to work. It is often less stressful than other areas of law since there is usually less at stake in civil cases . Finally, civil law can be a very intellectually stimulating field since it often involves complex legal issues and problem solving.

5.  What skills do you believe you have that will make you a successful lawyer, please elaborate with an example.

First,l believe that l have skills that will make me a successful lawyer since I have strong communication skills.It is highlighted as l was the Projects Officer of the Eastern Eagles Rovers Scouts Club at my school. I was the one who was responsible for presenting club proposals to the school stuff through meetings which were successful.Also lm good at problem solving and at one point there were few students at our school who were unable to register for their final exams because of financial problems,l was able to come up with an idea to conduct a short term income generating project and as a club we were able to support them financially.
04/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Apologies for late submission,the first document l created was lost by mistake so l had to create another one
04/12/23, 3:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries dear, I am happy to see that you have completed it now.
04/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Thank maam is it detailed?
04/12/23, 3:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes dear, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *BA LLB* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
04/12/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes the information is accurate!
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for the confirmation @263780085885, As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
04/12/23, 3:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
04/12/23, 3:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
04/12/23, 3:48 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes
04/12/23, 3:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 3:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 3:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 3:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
04/12/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 4:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. The installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
04/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Ok!
04/12/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 4:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 4:23 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Understood
04/12/23, 4:24 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes l would like to know!
04/12/23, 4:35 pm - +263 78 008 5885: What will be the costs of my admission process and my higher education?
04/12/23, 5:15 pm - +263 78 008 5885: ...all in all?
04/12/23, 5:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I will be happy to assist you here @263780085885. Let me share that we could not share the specific costs with you at the moment, once we complete our discussion today we will move ahead with your application at multiple universities. When you will receive your offer letter then you will be able to know your actual cost of education however, we have share a specific range with you for your financial preparation. I would like to encourage you to start your financial preparation in advance.
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Ok that l understand.
04/12/23, 5:33 pm - +263 78 008 5885: So does it means that l will receive offer letter before A level results are out or what, can you explain that to me.
04/12/23, 5:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes Kupakwashe, You will receive your offer letter before your A level results
04/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Noted!
04/12/23, 5:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
04/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
04/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
04/12/23, 5:39 pm - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes
04/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Awesome!
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @263780085885. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
04/12/23, 5:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
04/12/23, 5:44 pm - +263 78 008 5885: That's true!
04/12/23, 5:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct @263780085885. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
04/12/23, 5:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
04/12/23, 5:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
04/12/23, 5:46 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
04/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Let's proceed.
04/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
04/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
04/12/23, 5:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
04/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Understood!
04/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
04/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
04/12/23, 5:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes.
04/12/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. *Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

 I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
04/12/23, 6:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
04/12/23, 6:05 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 4. *Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.* 

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
04/12/23, 6:05 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
04/12/23, 6:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for December 15, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before December 15, 2023. The remaining $450 should be paid by January 15, 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
04/12/23, 6:09 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Im following everything!
04/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263780085885. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
04/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 008 5885: You can provide more information maam
04/12/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
04/12/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
04/12/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
04/12/23, 6:15 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
04/12/23, 6:18 pm - +263 78 008 5885: It is now clear
04/12/23, 6:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
04/12/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 6:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
04/12/23, 6:24 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes!
04/12/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
04/12/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
04/12/23, 6:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
04/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 008 5885: It's clear
04/12/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
04/12/23, 6:44 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
04/12/23, 6:47 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes it's clear!
04/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
04/12/23, 7:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/12/23, 8:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I please know if we are still connected @263780085885 ?
04/12/23, 9:37 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Understood!
04/12/23, 9:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 9:40 pm - +263 78 008 5885: For now I have no questions.
04/12/23, 9:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: So, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
04/12/23, 9:42 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes l am ma'am!
04/12/23, 9:43 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to your chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.

04/12/23, 9:44 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Thank you.
04/12/23, 9:45 pm - +263 78 008 5885: So how long will it take?

15/12/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please allow me to correct you here, as your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship is $350 and your  Sports and Misc. Fee are $250.
15/12/23, 6:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
15/12/23, 7:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263780085885 May I know if we are still connected?
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes it is
15/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Im having network challenges
15/12/23, 7:51 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that you are having network challenges, I can understand them as they are beyond our control. May I know if we can continue with our discussion? <This message was edited>
15/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Let's try.
15/12/23, 8:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263780085885, As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
15/12/23, 8:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
15/12/23, 8:34 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Understood ma'am.
15/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
15/12/23, 8:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make their education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
15/12/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Noted
15/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Ok
15/12/23, 8:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/12/23, 8:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
15/12/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes
15/12/23, 8:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a student. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600- $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by your parents/guardians.

This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/12/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/12/23, 9:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
15/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 008 5885: So it is then reduced to $850
15/12/23, 9:21 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Right
15/12/23, 9:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct dear, Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1850- $1,000 = $850 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
15/12/23, 9:28 pm - +263 78 008 5885: No ma'am are you saying we should pay $850 whilst lm here then when l get there l should also pay another $850.
15/12/23, 9:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No @263780085885 While you are in your country, you need to pay your registration fees which is $1000 and after your arrival in India you need to pay the remaining amount which is $850 as your total expenses for the first year amount to $1850. May I know if you have any doubt please?
15/12/23, 9:34 pm - +263 78 008 5885: I understand
15/12/23, 9:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263780085885, Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as December 28th, 2023*.
15/12/23, 9:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/12/23, 10:01 pm - +263 78 008 5885: Yes you can explain.
15/12/23, 10:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900  can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$450  before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/12/23, 10:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
