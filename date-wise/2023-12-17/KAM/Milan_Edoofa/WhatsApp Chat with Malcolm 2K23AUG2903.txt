For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
11/09/23, 9:14 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am ,we can start
11/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/09/23, 9:59 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes lm done now
11/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
11/09/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
11/09/23, 10:03 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes , yes they are
11/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
11/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
11/09/23, 10:05 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am following
11/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
11/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
11/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes they are clear sir
12/09/23, 2:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Malcolm.  I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

12/09/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Okay for now lm okay l don’t have any questions sir please
12/09/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Sorry for the late reply sir ,l was at school soo didn’t get the chance to answer
12/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
12/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright sir no problem
12/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir we may
12/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
12/09/23, 8:21 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes , please do
12/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

12/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
12/09/23, 8:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

14/09/23, 7:05 am - +263 78 366 5167: Morning sir ,sorry for being absent yesterday was very busy with some school work .soo in the videos l learned that :
1)ESOOFA helps in giving people a sense of feeling independency mainly because of the EWYL program 
2)l also leaned that EDOOFA does not only provide scholarships because of academic excellence but because of many other attributes like behavior and attitude and this leaves a student to make a difference in his /her life 
3)l also learnt that a lot of hard work and commitment was done by EDOOFA to convince Prestigious Institutions to offer scholarships too

18/09/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Malcolm,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: The weekend was very fine and everything was great , l hope yours was well too
18/09/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am available right now sir
18/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
18/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
18/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
18/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
18/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir we are
18/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 366 5167: The videos were indeed interesting l really learnt a lot from them
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 3:30 PM.
18/09/23, 9:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/09/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Malcolm,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you at our scheduled time as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. 

Please let me know if you are available and ready so that we can proceed with the session.
19/09/23, 8:50 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir we’re available
19/09/23, 8:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
19/09/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright sir let me share them with you
19/09/23, 8:58 pm - +263 78 366 5167: <Media omitted>

19/09/23, 9:01 pm - +263 78 366 5167: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is Biotechnology and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
19/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir the information is accurate sir
19/09/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Wow lm pleased 😃
19/09/23, 9:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
19/09/23, 9:38 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am ready
19/09/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 366 5167: L have a question sir please
19/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
19/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
19/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
19/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes
19/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
19/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
19/09/23, 9:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
19/09/23, 9:50 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes that’s correct
19/09/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 10:13 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes we are
19/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
19/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
19/09/23, 10:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l have sir
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Understood
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
19/09/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
19/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes
19/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noted
19/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
19/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
19/09/23, 10:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
19/09/23, 10:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/09/23, 10:48 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noo sir l have gained a proper understanding thankyou
19/09/23, 10:49 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Well l guess l have to ask about the Earn while you learn program ,when is the program going to start sir
19/09/23, 10:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be provided with the link tomorrow, dear. As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!
20/09/23, 8:39 am - +263 78 366 5167: Morning
20/09/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:37 pm - +263 78 366 5167: The evening is really great sir
20/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes , l am ready
20/09/23, 8:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have taken a step forward for your dream of education abroad and are working hard to prepare for your higher educational finances, we would be helping you initiate your EWYL Program so that you can utilize the next few months wisely and prepare for your journey to India.

20/09/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright sir let me do as you have said

25/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Afternoon sir

Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.

26/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, dear <This message was edited>
26/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
26/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
26/09/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
26/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 366 5167: School ends at 4pm
26/09/23, 5:14 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Thankyou but lm available now if you’re
26/09/23, 5:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes I am available too.
26/09/23, 5:17 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright great sir
26/09/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me know once you've examined these advantages, and we can then delve into a detailed discussion of each one, step by step.
26/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir l did
26/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
26/09/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
26/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes sir
26/09/23, 5:42 pm - +263 78 366 5167: This is great
26/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes it does
26/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noted
26/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 6:14 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes sir it does that’s really great
26/09/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 6:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l understand
26/09/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Your explanation is quite good
26/09/23, 6:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l would like to know more information
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 6:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 6:27 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes l l see how that’s really helpful
26/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 366 5167: L have a question,what if a student fails to get two E grades and for example he/she gets a minimum of 5 points an A from one subject,what will happen to the student’s scholarship
26/09/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for now as I will be connecting with another batch of my students. So, I will be connecting with you tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Have a blessed day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
26/09/23, 6:53 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright sir thankyou very much will wait for the same
27/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Evening sir ,how are you
27/09/23, 7:01 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Sorry lm late but l am
27/09/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes that’s true
27/09/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
27/09/23, 9:51 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l agree sir
27/09/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
27/09/23, 9:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
27/09/23, 10:18 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes l am
29/09/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust you're doing wonderfully.

I wanted to share that I won't be accessible until Monday. I look forward to reconnecting with you on Tuesday at 5:00 PM. Wishing you a blessed day, and please extend my warm regards to your dear family.
29/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh, alright sir it’s alright l will connect with you on Monday Thankyou.Have a good weekend sir
03/10/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am available sir , we may proceed
03/10/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
03/10/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
03/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l am
03/10/23, 3:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
04/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh yes,l understand perfectly
04/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 366 5167: Morning sir ,l have a question…like after l complete my bachelors degree l would like to do further studies and do a masters degree in biotechnology will the EDOOFA program cover me for my masters and is possible
04/10/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear parents and Malcolm.  I hope you are well and blessed.

Yes, it is indeed possible for that and we would love to guide you throughout the master's degree that you wish to pursue.

04/10/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be required to pursue your master's only and once you have completed your master's degree.
04/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Can one persue a masters degree first without a ordinary degree
04/10/23, 3:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is not possible to pursue a master's degree without an ordinary degree. A master's degree is seen as an advanced level of study that builds upon the foundational knowledge and skills acquired during undergraduate education.
04/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh l get it soo l will get the ordinary one first thankyou
04/10/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 366 5167: And then further it to a masters
04/10/23, 3:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct. If you are clear shall we proceed with the session?

05/10/23, 8:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
05/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noo l have noo queries,l understood

, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are  among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

13/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 366 5167: L applied for biotechnology a four year course not medical biotechnology soo lm confused please
13/10/23, 1:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thanks for bringing this up. I can see why you might be confused about the duration. The course you've been admitted to, Biotechnology, at Galgotias University is a 3-year program, not a 4-year one as you were expecting. It appears that there's been a slight misunderstanding.

The curriculum is designed to be comprehensive and rigorous, covering all essential aspects of Biotechnology within these 3 years. Is this clearer now?
13/10/23, 2:07 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh , okay now l understand…soo it’s biotechnology not just medical
13/10/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: Exactly, Malcolm! You've got it. It's a broader Biotechnology program that covers various facets of the field, not just the medical aspect. So you'll get a well-rounded education in the subject over the course of 3 years. I hope this is clear now?
13/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that we are together so far. Now, Let me provide you with a brief overview of the two types of accommodation options provided at Galgotias University -
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. *On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: 2. *Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You can seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility.

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also look for accommodation on your own and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
13/10/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright
13/10/23, 2:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
13/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes l understand
13/10/23, 2:29 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
13/10/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes we are
13/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 78 366 5167: But l have a question about the offer letters , am l going to receive more letters as we go from which l can get the chance to choose from
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malcolm!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here right?
17/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Malcolm!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:00 pm - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side earlier, yesterday. Now, may I know if you were able to go through this message of mine so that we can move ahead with our discussion here?
17/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Afternoon,

17/10/23, 4:27 pm - +263 78 366 5167: The examination time slots are as follows:
From 9PM ,1:00PM and 3PM too
17/10/23, 4:28 pm - +263 78 366 5167: But l understood perfectly
17/10/23, 4:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is alright please dear, I understand that. Moving ahead, may I know if we can proceed with our discussion now? <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Afternoon, yes right now l just came back from an exam soo we can proceed please
18/10/23, 9:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here please?
18/10/23, 10:45 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes yes l am
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know dear. May I know if we can now move ahead with the discussion dear?
18/10/23, 10:46 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes we can
18/10/23, 10:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear till here as well, right?
18/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes please
18/10/23, 10:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
18/10/23, 11:54 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes we are please
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 25th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 25th November 2023.*
19/10/23, 3:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *25th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Yes we’re clear
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
19/10/23, 4:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
19/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Noo in Bindura
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 366 5167: No
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
19/10/23, 4:04 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
19/10/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Oooh alright thankyou

19/10/23, 4:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note Malcolm, if I may ask why would it be that you won't be able to make the payment within the mentioned days?
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Well ,my parents are still gathering the money and l don’t know if they are going to finish that within the number of days mentioned by the UNIVERSITY
19/10/23, 4:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, how much were they able to raise by now Malcolm?
19/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Well l don’t know the exact amount
19/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 78 366 5167: But let me ask them and l will get back with you,or they will rather inform you on their own
19/10/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please do that and then let me know of the amount that they have raise till now so that I can help you in planning the next steps in your admission journey effectively. I hope you understand, right?

31/10/23, 4:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand your concern about the university's deadline, and I appreciate your patience in this matter. It's important to note that each university has its own admission deadlines, and missing a deadline can affect the current offer.

On that note, when would it be convenient for you and your parents to have a more detailed discussion about this?

06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malcolm!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 06:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 06.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 6:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malcolm!
I trust this message finds you well.

As previously mentioned, we have established a dedicated time for our discussions to ensure smoother communication and progression with the admission process. I hope this time aligns well with your schedule.

On that note, may I know if we can connect with each other here so that we can move ahead with our discussion? <This message was edited>

09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Malcolm!
I hope you are doing well today.

I wanted to share an important update with you here that we will not be available from 10th November to 13th November, as Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is one of the biggest festivals in India. It is often referred to as the "Festival of Lights" and is celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.

We wish you a Happy Diwali from the side of the entire Edoofa Family. May the divine light of Diwali fill your life with love prosperity and happiness. On that note, we will now reconnect with each other here on Tuesday 14th November at the scheduled time of our session.
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 366 5167: Alright happy Diwali 🪔

18/11/23, 8:51 am - +263 78 366 5167: It’s going great sir ,
23/11/23, 6:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Malcolm!
I hope this message finds you well.

It has been some time since we last connected. I apologize for the gap, as I've been preoccupied with the admission process for a group of students scheduled to complete it this month.

I trust your understanding on this matter. Now, I would like to engage in a conversation with you to plan the next steps in your admission journey. This will ensure that you can smoothly progress through the process and embark on your higher education journey alongside those students who are about to complete their admission. May I know if you are ready for that?

23/11/23, 8:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: This means that you wish to pay $200 by 27th November, and the rest of $400 by 27th December, is that so?

23/11/23, 9:15 pm - +27 73 838 7467: yes ,if you are okay with it ,that would be really helpful <This message was edited>
23/11/23, 9:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for the information provided. Moving forward, to proceed with the payment, it is necessary for you to send an email to "*academicboard@edoofa.com*". In the email, kindly state your intention to make monthly payments of $200 for the next three months, November, December, and January clearing the total fee by the 27th of each month. Additionally, inquire about securing the scholarship seat alongside the benefits of the Endowment Plan if you opt for this payment plan. I trust this is clear and understood?
