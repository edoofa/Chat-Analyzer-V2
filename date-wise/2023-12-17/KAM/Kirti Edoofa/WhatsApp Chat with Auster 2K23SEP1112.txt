31/10/23, 12:26 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Am very pleased with you people following all the steps you are taking transparently
31/10/23, 12:31 am - +265 991 40 67 78: We are ready to participate with your team dedicatedly and untirelessly. Guide Auster the right directions as indicated so as to produce more through Edoofa.

31/10/23, 5:19 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Do we need to print and fill all the forms and then send to you and what form of sending?
Are all forms needed to be completed by today, together with the online one?
When is the orientation day for the EWYLP?
31/10/23, 5:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I can understand that Auster is currently in her exams right now. Starting the EWYL program now should not adversely affect her exams, which already began on October 16th. The EWYL program is designed to provide additional support and guidance to help you prepare for your exams more effectively. By participating in the program, she can enhance her study skills, time management, and subject understanding, which can ultimately benefit her performance in the upcoming exams.
31/10/23, 5:21 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Examinations not yet started but are learning and preparing for that?
31/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @265991406778 I shall answer your queries one by one as I mentioned earlier, I will get back to them.
31/10/23, 5:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, it is alright. However, it's essential to strike a balance between the EWYL program commitments and her school Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
31/10/23, 5:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if he is occupied with exams, you as parents on his behalf are free to get started with the EWYL program on the 7th of November, and the next date will be followed as the *orientation date*, we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?
31/10/23, 5:27 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: We are on the same boat yah,
31/10/23, 5:27 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Noted about the date of the 7th November,
31/10/23, 5:28 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Do we need to fill now the online form?
31/10/23, 5:29 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Finish answering them so that we should still be fully together
31/10/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you can fill out the online form now if your network is stable.
31/10/23, 5:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, coming back to your queries, the orientation date will be next day of your EWYL start program date which is 7th November. It's important to note that all three of these forms should be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 02:30 PM. This timeline is essential to ensure a smooth progression in the admission process and to meet the goal of concluding this session before Tuesday, enabling us to assist you in initiating your EWYL process on time.

Therefore, could you kindly inform me of your expected timeframe for filling out these forms from your perspective?
31/10/23, 5:47 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Last day should may be Thursday as this time many offices for printing are closed
31/10/23, 5:48 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: So after filling, should I send in a form of pdf or picture?
31/10/23, 5:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is completely your wish @265991406778 you can share in the form of pictures as well if that is convenient for you. I understand that printing forms can be difficult. However, Thursday is a long time, as I mentioned earlier, we need to be proactive to complete the process within 4 days and then only you as a parent will be able to start the EWYL program by the 7th of November. So please I would encourage you to get the forms printed out from a nearby internet cafe by tomorrow, if students are not available parents can also fill out and sign the forms on their behalf.

01/11/23, 5:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/11/23, 5:29 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah
01/11/23, 5:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah go on
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/11/23, 5:32 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah
01/11/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/11/23, 5:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/11/23, 5:35 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yes
01/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/11/23, 5:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/11/23, 5:36 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah very clear
01/11/23, 5:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/11/23, 5:38 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah
01/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/11/23, 5:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: If you are ready, shall I share the videos with you here now?
01/11/23, 5:42 pm - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah u can
01/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
01/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

01/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

01/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/11/23, 6:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?

01/11/23, 7:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that, however, to move ahead we would require you know your understanding of the 4 videos as well.

02/11/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It sounds like you've been experiencing network and internet connectivity issues. I understand that this can be quite frustrating, especially when trying to use your SIM card. It's great that your SIM card registration has been approved and I am glad to hear that you have gone through the videos.
02/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
02/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
02/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
02/11/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the JCE letter, may I know by when will you be able to share the remaning two documents?

07/11/23, 1:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, however, in this letter her MSCE subject combination is not noted. A letter of recommendation for MSCE should also have the subject combinations for MSCE as well.
07/11/23, 1:23 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: She is sitting for MSCE this year
07/11/23, 1:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please I am aware of that and that is why a letter of recommendation is required with her MSCE Subject combination stated in that letter as well.
07/11/23, 1:26 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Oky, then I never knew of this, so what's should be the solution?

07/11/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

07/11/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe she wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course B.Sc (Cardiovascular Technology) for her higher education in India as per the August 2025 intake?
07/11/23, 4:10 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: The faculty, yes it's that, the intake might vary depending on when the results will be released, if they will be out July August next year then, she will join the intake of 2024

08/11/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Auster.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
08/11/23, 1:10 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Afternoon too
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you, now coming back to your statement yesterday, yes you are correct, your application will be processed like those for 2024 intakes, if the results are released early she can definitely join in the August 2024 intake however, if the results are released late then her admission will be deferred to August 2025. 

May I know if you are clear so far?
08/11/23, 1:51 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Yes very clear
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.
08/11/23, 2:12 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Thanks
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 2:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 2:26 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Points noted yes
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 2:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Clear yes
08/11/23, 2:41 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Sorry am taking time because am attending two sessions EWYL are also on the line
08/11/23, 3:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is alright, please I am glad to know that you are giving your EWYL sessions priority do let me know when you will be available to continue with our discussion please.
08/11/23, 3:44 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Seems they are fininsh am free
08/11/23, 3:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that @265991406778. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/11/23, 3:47 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Yes
08/11/23, 3:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
08/11/23, 3:53 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Two weeks is just crusification, give a reasonable period
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand. Since we are connected with more than 250+ universities and every university has its own deadline period so letting you know the exact timeline is not possible for me. Now let me help you understand the remaining breakdown better.
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
08/11/23, 4:07 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Very clear
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
08/11/23, 4:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
08/11/23, 4:15 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Well illustrated
08/11/23, 4:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Not now
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear so far. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
08/11/23, 4:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 4:32 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Thanks
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I hope you are excited to see Auster in this image for the next year batch?
08/11/23, 4:38 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Very excited
08/11/23, 4:39 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Do you allow parents to visit their wards?
08/11/23, 4:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please @265991406778 if a parent wants to visit their child they can surely come to visit them in India, they would need to apply for a tourist visa for that.
08/11/23, 4:44 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Is it not hard to get the tourist visa and how long does it to be accepted for the visa??
08/11/23, 4:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please it is not hard to get a tourist visa for India. You can get an Indian tourist visa within 10-15 days after you submit the visa application form.
08/11/23, 5:17 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Oky thanks
08/11/23, 5:17 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: We may go further
08/11/23, 5:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
08/11/23, 5:28 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: I see you work tirelessly
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
08/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
08/11/23, 5:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
08/11/23, 5:47 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Let's proceed
08/11/23, 5:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
08/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level, MSCE and JCE results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
08/11/23, 5:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Auster, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
08/11/23, 5:54 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Oky points taken
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
08/11/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 6:02 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Very reasonable yes
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
08/11/23, 6:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
08/11/23, 6:15 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Quite clear
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
08/11/23, 6:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
08/11/23, 6:18 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: So clear
08/11/23, 6:20 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Well arranged and gives also time to the sponsor to refresh
08/11/23, 6:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level MSCE results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
08/11/23, 6:29 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Just provide if there is some yes
08/11/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely. let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level, MSCE results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
08/11/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
08/11/23, 6:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without assistance from Edoofa?
08/11/23, 7:07 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Noted
08/11/23, 7:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
08/11/23, 7:19 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Which ones are the two A Level Passes(or E grades)?
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A level here is equal to MSCE and here we are referring to 2 passing points in MSCE, please.
08/11/23, 7:25 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: 2 passing points,
Like scoring 2points per particular subject?
08/11/23, 7:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @265991406778 2 passing points over all please.
08/11/23, 7:28 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Let's proceed
08/11/23, 7:30 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level/ MSCE (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
08/11/23, 7:34 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Oky
08/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level/ MSCE

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
08/11/23, 7:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
08/11/23, 7:50 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Very clear yes
08/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
08/11/23, 7:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
08/11/23, 7:53 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Good resolution though
08/11/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
08/11/23, 7:56 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Where to be conducting the EWYL Program?
08/11/23, 8:05 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the EWYL groups shared above.
08/11/23, 8:10 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Oky
08/11/23, 8:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. So may I know if you are clear so far?
08/11/23, 8:24 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Very clear
08/11/23, 8:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
08/11/23, 8:25 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: All is clear and understood
08/11/23, 8:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. As Auster's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that she is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
08/11/23, 8:27 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: All is well
08/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well. Once you share all her academic documents we will be able to share her application with the universities.
08/11/23, 8:30 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: You will receive by 10am tomorrow, together with the ID

25/11/23, 3:33 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Thanks

15/12/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion -	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/12/23, 9:14 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Thanks
15/12/23, 9:15 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall wait for your response to the above questions.
15/12/23, 9:17 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: 1, $1800
2,     4yrs
3, $  300
4, $  750
15/12/23, 9:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the responses, however, could you please check your response for question 1 because as per my understanding Auster's per semester fee after scholarship is $900?
15/12/23, 9:28 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: What are the differences on those columns?
15/12/23, 9:30 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: I see $1800 per semester
I see 50%
I see $900
Is after scholarship meaning being accepted?
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/12/23, 9:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 10:00 am as it is Saturday our available hours will be from 08:30 am to 01:30 pm. I hope you will be available, have a great evening ahead.
15/12/23, 9:43 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Welcome thanks, great evening to you too
16/12/23, 9:58 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Auster.

I hope you are doing well. With regard to my message yesterday. I wanted to reach out and check if you are available to connect with us now so that we can move ahead and continue with our discussion and I can assist you in understanding the letter better?
16/12/23, 10:03 am - +265 993 42 43 29: Good morning to you all
16/12/23, 10:15 am - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
16/12/23, 10:17 am - +265 993 42 43 29: Yeah
16/12/23, 10:18 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Morning back
16/12/23, 10:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
16/12/23, 10:29 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Just simplify everything mostly on the figures and their duration
16/12/23, 10:35 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Each year complises of 2 semesters, is it?
Is $900 covering both semesters?
There is $300,is for what?
There is $25 is for what aswell?
Then hostels,
16/12/23, 11:12 am - Kirti Edoofa: @265991406778 I appreciate your need for clarity on the costs. I completely understand the desire for thorough understanding. I'm grateful that you took the time to carefully review the offer letter and compile your questions. It's reassuring to know that you are actively engaged in this process.
16/12/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: In our discussion, this is exactly what I intend to do. In our discussion today all the finances will be discussed all together however, since there are a lot of figures and if we randomly start discussing them then there is a good chance that you might not be able to understand.  Hence I would appreciate you being a little patient we will start with the tuition fee, to the accommodation fee, and then the remaining components such as the admission processing fee and the registration fee mentioned in the letter. For me to help you out please let me know if you are willing to continue with the discussion?
16/12/23, 11:15 am - +265 991 40 67 78: We are ready for everything
16/12/23, 11:16 am - +265 991 40 67 78: I just wanted to be on the same track with you all
16/12/23, 11:17 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now as outlined in your offer letter, your course is a three-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 6 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
16/12/23, 11:19 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Meaning each semester is $900,
$1800 is for 2 semesters. In a year $2800?
16/12/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, as mentioned I will explain you all the costs, please I would encourage you to be patient @265991406778. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
16/12/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
16/12/23, 11:34 am - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
16/12/23, 11:44 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Well simplified
16/12/23, 11:45 am - +265 991 40 67 78: As a new Comer on compus is better
16/12/23, 11:47 am - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation for you?
16/12/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Let me clear that query for you so that you are not left with two thoughts. Let me help you it is completely a student's choice to select the accommodation, however, all our students prefer to stay off-campus since it is cheaper compared to the on-campus and students have the freedom to cook for themselves as well and off-campus also includes the same number of facilities like the on-campus now I understand that being parents you can be concerned about the safety and security at off- campus.
16/12/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
16/12/23, 11:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
16/12/23, 11:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: If you want I can also help you connect with the students who are already staying off-campus because when you are in your home country it is natural for you to think that on-campus is better but over time students understand that it is the same and off-campus offers the same facility at a much cheaper price. In the end, the decision is yours if you do not wish to decide now you can even decide after you arrive in India. 

May I know if you are clear now?
16/12/23, 11:51 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Very clear
16/12/23, 11:53 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
16/12/23, 11:57 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Examination fee is clear
16/12/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
16/12/23, 11:57 am - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 29th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
16/12/23, 11:59 am - +265 991 40 67 78: Quiet clear
16/12/23, 12:03 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: So earn while you learn program, does this also only contribute to tuition fee only or even to accommodation also?
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Waiting
16/12/23, 12:27 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Do you extend a bit the stated period of 15days or its a must?
16/12/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The scholarship credits earned in the EWYL program will be helping you in reducing your tuition fee after you register yourself with the university.
16/12/23, 12:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/12/23, 12:46 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Yes, entirely welcome
16/12/23, 12:47 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 29th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 29th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/12/23, 12:50 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Kindly appreciated
16/12/23, 12:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 29th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/12/23, 12:51 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Edoofa relieves abundantly
16/12/23, 12:55 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/12/23, 12:56 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, regarding the payment modes:

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter. As these are Indian account details, you won't find a corresponding account in Malawi. However, you can make a deposit into that account through a Telegraphic Transfer if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.

Alternatively, if you have access to a Visa/Mastercard, you can choose to make the payment through online modes such as Paypal or PayGlocal. Please inform me of the mode of payment that is suitable for you and your family, and I will assist you with the details accordingly.
16/12/23, 1:00 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: I only know TT through my bank
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely you can do that, just let me know a day before you make the deposit this will help me to assist you with an invoice. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
16/12/23, 1:09 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Noted yes
16/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
16/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
16/12/23, 1:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Understood yes
16/12/23, 1:14 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: So the semester fee of $900,does it also paid in 2 installments
What about the accommodation fee also?
16/12/23, 1:19 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern, let me help you understand, yes please in off-campus accommodations since you will be paying the rent directly to the landlord you can pay the rent monthly and for the semester fee ideally the students have to pay all at once after they arrive in India, however since you are enrolled through Edoofa. After Auster arrives in India, there's also an option for students to pay the balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
16/12/23, 1:20 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Thanks
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome. With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/12/23, 1:34 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: Well clarified
16/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/12/23, 1:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/12/23, 1:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, as it has been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours for Saturday, let's reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great day and weekend, and looking forward to our conversation.
16/12/23, 1:58 pm - +265 991 40 67 78: If there is some more information am ready
16/12/23, 1:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: There is no more information @265991406778 Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
