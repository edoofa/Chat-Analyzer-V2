Rhodyn Richmore Makaza is my name and I'm from Manicaland province. I was born in 2001 in Chimanimani district. My father was Josphat and he died in 2011when I was 10 and in grade 3 at Ndima Primary school which is about 3km away from our homestead. He was a carpenter and Swere Ngidi my mother took the burden over her shoulders and sent us, my twin sister Rholyn and I, to school. 
 
We then finished grade seven at Mutsvangwa primary school, 5km close to the Mozambican border, and mom was senting us to school with money got from piece works. We both get 6 units and was pleasing. 

We then went to Ndima Gvt High for the secondary education and there the fees was the challenge. Richman Makaza, my late father's young brother chipped in for the first 2 terms and he had a challenge since he is a driver and he had a family and childrn to take of too. So mother struggled to sent us to school till we finished ordinary level. I want to tahnk Richman for the support he gave us. We passed all the 8 subjects including Hexco to make them 9 with pleasing symbols. We then did A level in 2019 at Mafumise high school in the outskirts of chipinge districts and mother was bearing the burden for two more years. Richman chipped in registering exams snd I appreciated that. 

My mother earn money but selling bananas in fruit markets. Now my twin sister is at Mutare poly doing IT. I gave her the opportunity to go to tetiary education since mom couldn't afford to pay fees for us since the fees are unbearable.
18/11/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your incredible journey with such depth. Your resilience and determination are truly inspiring. It's evident that your family, especially your mother and Uncle Richman, have played pivotal roles in shaping your educational path.

Your dedication to your twin sister's education despite financial constraints speaks volumes about your character. Providing her the opportunity for tertiary education while acknowledging the challenges your family faced demonstrates your selflessness and admirable values.

This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.

29/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Am doing good sir and you
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 198 7801: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 198 7801: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
04/12/23, 7:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
04/12/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Yes sir am ready


Let's start
04/12/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Yes am done with it sir
04/12/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose. <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
04/12/23, 7:54 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Very clear sir
04/12/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
04/12/23, 7:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
04/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Yes am following and it is understandable
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
04/12/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
05/12/23, 8:07 am - +263 77 198 7801: Clear sir
05/12/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
05/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Evening how are you sir?

Yeah let's proceed
05/12/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
05/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Yes 
Let's start
05/12/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Sir, network at our home is very poor so I walk to where it is strong and because of this reason, I'm asking for your favour to schedule an effective time slot so that we can have a good discussion and once we are done, we are done for a day's session.
05/12/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 198 7801: For example if we say *7pm CAT to 9pm CAT* or any time you are free
05/12/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
05/12/23, 7:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
05/12/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 198 7801: Yes sir
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
05/12/23, 8:38 pm - +263 77 198 7801: By tommorow at *8:30 AM CAT*
05/12/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
06/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 77 198 7801: For a student to have high scholarship credits and maximum scholarship, he should be teachable and open minded i.e he should be intelligent and creative. Also he should follow intrusctions accordingly
06/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 198 7801: The vision of tge founers of Edoofa is that quality education but accessible and that students must job ready after course completion. So they invested a lot of time to seacrh for universities in which Edoofians should go and student must be able convince the university admission team the same he or she convinced the Admission Board of Edoofa. This is done by filling the SOP form
06/12/23, 8:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
