05/12/23, 3:17 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Okay
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Vida, Also,I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/12/23, 3:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, Proceeding further, you might be aware of that Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education destination

I would be interested to hear your perspective on why you believe studying in India and within the Indian Education System would be instrumental in achieving your dreams.
05/12/23, 3:37 pm - +233 20 431 1651: India is one  of the countries  with  rich  cultural  values  and of good  academic excellence in terms  of  pharmaceutical products  and IT.  In view  of this  l value  this  to areas of study  and  l believe  if my ward  is given  the opportunity  to do IT  he will  be one of the great scholars  in our time.
05/12/23, 3:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mrs Vida, Let me share some information about India and various global leaders who are Indian alumni

07/12/23, 1:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Education is a Key to Success*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
07/12/23, 4:26 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Good  afternoon
07/12/23, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good evening Mrs. Vida,
How are you doing?
07/12/23, 4:51 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Good,  hope  you are also doing  well
07/12/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, thank you for the concern
07/12/23, 5:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Vida, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
07/12/23, 5:08 pm - +233 20 431 1651: No
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*

11/12/23, 1:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Yes please
11/12/23, 1:54 pm - +233 20 431 1651: No
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
11/12/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
11/12/23, 1:57 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Sorry , something  popped  up  and it kept the whole  family  busy. We are Sorry.
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright!
11/12/23, 2:12 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please acknowledge this.
11/12/23, 2:53 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Yes,it will be of much benefit, because you will be made  work ready. Because the  necessary   skills   needed  for  employment  will  be obtained  whiles in School.
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/12/23, 3:00 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Okay
11/12/23, 3:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Vida, Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
11/12/23, 3:25 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Okay  number, 4 ,3 and 2.

12/12/23, 12:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you all are doing well today,

May I know if you are available for the session now?
12/12/23, 1:13 pm - +233 55 948 3791: We're all doing well please
12/12/23, 1:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Albert!
12/12/23, 1:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have gone through the previous information, so may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/12/23, 1:16 pm - +233 55 948 3791: My parents will be responsible for that please
12/12/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/12/23, 1:25 pm - +233 55 948 3791: Yes
My family members are eager to help me persue my  education abroad and will be very happy if I get the opportunity.
12/12/23, 1:30 pm - +233 55 948 3791: I will be very happy if I get in touch with the beneficiaries in Ghana
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Albert, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
12/12/23, 2:58 pm - +233 55 948 3791: Yes please
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
12/12/23, 3:27 pm - +233 55 948 3791: Yes please
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Albert, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
12/12/23, 3:28 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - +233 55 948 3791: Alright madam
12/12/23, 3:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 9:38 pm - Pallika Edoofa: My office hours are over here, Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT (13/12/2023)* to resume your session (In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)

Stay Blessed!
13/12/23, 12:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good afternoon Everyone,
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Yes oo by the grace  of God
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Good morning
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please address this, Mrs. Vida.
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +233 20 431 1651: I would  like  you to explain  point 1,  2 and 5  to us.
13/12/23, 1:17 pm - +233 20 431 1651: In brief how it is going  to be done.
13/12/23, 1:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 1:22 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Yea the  5
13/12/23, 1:53 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
13/12/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
13/12/23, 4:43 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Yea
13/12/23, 4:52 pm - +233 55 948 3791: Please the step 5 is not all that clear to me
Must you pay $500 before you get there and pay the rest latter?
13/12/23, 4:52 pm - +233 55 948 3791: And the visa application too
13/12/23, 4:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Vida, *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
13/12/23, 4:57 pm - +233 20 431 1651: Ok
13/12/23, 5:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Vida, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
