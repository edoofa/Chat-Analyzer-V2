16/12/23, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
16/12/23, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
16/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 277 3134: Understood thank you

16/12/23, 11:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
16/12/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 277 3134: That's wonderful it will surely cut some significant costs
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Ms. Moyo!
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
16/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 277 3134: Hard to choose really
16/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 71 277 3134: I loved 1. The expert career counseling

16/12/23, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 277 3134: Me and my husband
16/12/23, 11:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with your family after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feels about you studying abroad?
16/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 71 277 3134: Wonderful
16/12/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad that you liked the certificates of our Edoofians!
16/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 71 277 3134: It would be a dream come true. As a mother I'll be proud to have my child study abroad
16/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 71 277 3134: They're nice and motivating
16/12/23, 11:56 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, Your joy and pride are truly heartwarming. We are honored to be a part of making your dream come true and are committed to ensuring a positive and enriching experience for your child as they embark on their academic journey abroad.
16/12/23, 11:57 am - Pallika Edoofa: As studying Internationally would make Phiri's career advance at an even greater pace, as he will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help him in uplifting his family there by himself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to his parents. <This message was edited>
16/12/23, 11:58 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
16/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 277 3134: Yes we'll discuss everything and make some necessary arrangements
16/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Yes that's all reasonable. May I ask, should the letter of recommendation come from his school?
16/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Well said
16/12/23, 12:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great, Ms. Moyo, I appreciate that!
16/12/23, 12:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Certainly, Ms. Moyo, the Letter of Recommendation will be provided by the senior authorities at the international universities, considering the student's background, academic results, and overall profile.
16/12/23, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
16/12/23, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
16/12/23, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 12:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
16/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Yes please
16/12/23, 12:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Moyo
16/12/23, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
16/12/23, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/12/23, 12:11 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Should the recommendation come from his primary, secondary and his high school or just his high school
16/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Okay thank you
16/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Noted
16/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Thank you
16/12/23, 12:17 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Moyo, Please note that it will be issued by the senior authorities of the universities in *India*
16/12/23, 12:18 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Stage 5
16/12/23, 12:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Ms. Moyo,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
16/12/23, 12:23 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Okay thank you
16/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 71 277 3134: Yes please
16/12/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure
16/12/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
16/12/23, 12:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
16/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 277 3134: All clear thank you
