*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Audrey Mupfeki. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *Tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

16/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: So now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
16/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
16/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 78 249 3011: "Thank you for the information about the scholarship. I'm really interested in applying, and I appreciate the background information you shared. It's helpful to know more about the scholarship and how it works."
16/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome Audrey
16/12/23, 10:37 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
16/12/23, 10:37 am - +267 74 612 137: This is really good to have such a good scholarship like this so what are conditions of the scholarship like how do apply how do you pay how much is it
16/12/23, 10:38 am - +27 69 391 6457: Yes we need to know the cost how does this work
16/12/23, 10:38 am - +267 74 612 137: That is true
16/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: We would be discussing the entire details in our session today.
16/12/23, 10:40 am - Harmehak: Sure please.
16/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 78 249 3011: "You're absolutely right. It's important to me to be able to take responsibility for my education and not be a burden on my parents. That's why I'm researching scholarships and financial aid options to make sure I can afford the school I want to attend."
16/12/23, 10:41 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Audrey, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Dangamvura high charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?
16/12/23, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Alright so Mr Taurai and Mrs Grace, before we proceed ahead, I would like to know you better as parents. 

Kindly go ahead, share a bit with us about yourself, what do you do, what is your highest qualification, and what motivates you to support your child ahead for education?
16/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 78 249 3011: My name is Audrey, and I'm a student who's currently in high school. My school is Dangamvura High, it charges $100 USD per term and I'm also the Headgirl of my school.l just got elected without even looking forward to it and this helped me to be even more confident because  of the time which l will be leading a group of my fellow colleagues.I'm interested in studying social work because I've always been fascinated by helping people who are in need and I also love sharing ideas and cancelling those people with personal issues. I'm a hard worker and I love to learn new things, but sometimes I struggle with procrastination. In my free time, I like to read, play netball, and go for long walks. I'm a person who has compassion, empathy and patience and most importantly I love being myself and I too optimistic . So l make sure that everything l do help me to go somewhere better
16/12/23, 10:52 am - +27 69 391 6457: Okay. My highest qualification is secondary level which is why l love Audrey to obtain higher than that.We are a small family (christian)me ,my husband and our three kids both in school.lm a caregiver by profession lm the only one working for the moment that's why l need to know if we can manage this program
16/12/23, 11:09 am - +267 74 612 137: My highest qualification is form 4  as the father of Audrey i really want her to go further with her education as i am not working because of my health only my wife she is the one who is taking care of us so its not easy for her alone  to take  care of the family
16/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Audrey and you Mrs and Mr Mupfeki, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
16/12/23, 11:30 am - Harmehak: It's great to know of your skills, Audrey.
16/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I appreciate your support to the family, Mrs Grace.
16/12/23, 11:31 am - Harmehak: I can understand please, I hope you feel better, Mr Taurai.
16/12/23, 11:32 am - +27 69 391 6457: Thank you
16/12/23, 11:33 am - +267 74 612 137: Thanks very much
16/12/23, 11:34 am - +263 78 249 3011: Wow that's so thoughtful of you to say
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please.
16/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Audrey, may I know more about your siblings please?
16/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 249 3011: Of course I would love to tell you more about my siblings.
Firstly Aubrey and Tanyaradzwa are my other halfs because I really care about them. If anything bad happens to them my heart will sank so they're indeed my other halfs. Aubrey is aged 13 and he will be in form one next year. As for Tanyaradzwa she the youngest and she is too much talkative and she's also light hearted 🤦🏾‍♀️. She will be in grade one next year, still at primary level.
Sometimes we hang out together., I really appreciate having siblings like them although sometimes they make me crazy. We always share our troubles to each other
And look after one another... The worst part is I'm not always with my siblings because I will be away for school. However when I'm around everything will be complete they always respect me as their sister and I love guiding them the right path to be successful in future
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Well expressed Audrey, 

It's a pleasure to know about your siblings, I can see you are really fond of them.
16/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Well Audrey, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
16/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 249 3011: studying abroad can be a life-changing experience in many ways. First, it can expose me to new cultures and ways of thinking, which can help me become more open-minded and culturally aware. Second, it can give me the opportunity to learn new languages and develop new skills. Finally, it can give me the chance to meet new people from all over the world and create lasting friendships. So overall, I believe that studying abroad can be a transformative experience that can positively impact my life...
16/12/23, 12:25 pm - Harmehak: That's well put across, Audrey,

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
16/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Absolutely,  mental preparedness is a key part of making the most of an experience abroad. Moving to a new country can be challenging, both emotionally and culturally. It's important to prepare myself mentally for the challenges l may face, like homesickness and culture shock. So I must say I'm prepared for a life abroad!
16/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Audrey, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So Mrs and Mr Mupfeki could you please share, if you as parents are willing to support her higher education abroad mentally and financially?
16/12/23, 12:44 pm - +27 69 391 6457: Yes we can say we're much willing to support our daughter mentally and financially for the betterment of her future
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - +27 69 391 6457: I believe Audrey can obtain this
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: I admire your trust please.
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Audrey, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Social work ?
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I can obtain more than these points 😊
16/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 249 3011: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: That's the spirit!
16/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Literature, History and Fares or Divinity that's my A level combination
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 78 249 3011: For me, there are a few things that motivate me to do social work. First, I believe that everyone deserves the opportunity to reach their full potential, and I want to help make that possible. Second, I'm passionate about making a positive impact on the world and improving people's lives. Finally, I find it very rewarding to see the results of my work and the impact it has on others. So overall, I'm motivated by a desire to help others and make a difference in the world
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please
16/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: That's surely well thought off, Audrey!

However, don't you believe Law or Psychology are two other departments that shall greatly align with your aspirations?
16/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 249 3011: That's a really interesting question, and I can definitely see how law and psychology could align with my aspirations. In fact, both of these fields often overlap with social work. In law, for example, there are many opportunities to help people and make a difference in their lives. And in psychology, there are many opportunities to understand and improve the human condition. I think all three of these fields are related and have the potential to make a positive impact on the world. What do you think?
16/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct and well put across,

So now that you are aware how Law and Psychology are fields that can help you flourish equally!

May I know which field out of the three are you most inclined towards?
16/12/23, 1:19 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Social work
16/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I feel like it's the field that allows for the most direct and meaningful impact on people's lives. It also allows for the greatest degree of flexibility, which I really appreciate.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: I understand and appreciate, Audrey.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - +263 78 249 3011: Thank you Ms Harmehak
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
16/12/23, 1:24 pm - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
16/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 249 3011: And I can see how sociology would be a good alternative for students who are interested in the field of social work. It seems like a very versatile and practical course, and it's great that students can still pursue careers in social work even if they don't have a degree in it. Thanks for sharing all of this with me! I really appreciate the insight
 Please now tell me if I do sociology does that mean I can still get involved in social working
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Harmehak: Yes please,

Let me brief you about Bachelors in Sociology
16/12/23, 1:38 pm - +263 78 249 3011: I'm all ears

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
