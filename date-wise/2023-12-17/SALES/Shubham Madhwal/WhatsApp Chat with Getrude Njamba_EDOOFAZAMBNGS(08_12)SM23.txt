Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
08/12/23, 12:07 pm - +260 97 2413156: I understand that it is a program that is offering schoolarship in different career fields to study in India.
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

09/12/23, 12:04 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me explain why Edoofa recommends India as a destination for higher study. You see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

1. *Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

09/12/23, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2413156: This is really interesting.
09/12/23, 12:12 pm - +260 97 2413156: I didn't know all this about India.
09/12/23, 12:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You too can achieve all of such success if you decide to give it all, once you come to India to complete your higher education
Because we at Edoofa believe in providing the best to our students, the simple reasoning is that our philosophy is providing Quality Higher Education to a student that will lead to employment in the foreseeable future. 

Now that you are aware, That is why we recommend India for your higher education, Can you explain why you want to study abroad and not in your native country?
09/12/23, 12:27 pm - +260 97 2413156: I want to study abroad than in my country because I believe the levels of education are  higher abroad than in Zambia and it will be easier for me to find an international job after I'm done with my course than when I study in my country.
09/12/23, 12:27 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 12:28 pm - +260 97 2413156: No I did not.
09/12/23, 12:32 pm - +260 96 3297443: Following the counseling session 🙏👏
09/12/23, 12:38 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As you're aware of the fact that you'll be starting your higher education here in India, may I know if you've any Knowledge about the Cost of Education here?
09/12/23, 12:41 pm - +260 97 2413156: I don't have any knowledge about the education fees
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *To understand it better, the cost of $2000 to $3000 per year which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester-wise (2 semesters in a year) after the student arrives at the University.*
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 12:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year*. Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly. <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 12:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this, we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program*
09/12/23, 12:50 pm - +260 97 2413156: If I understood you clearly you meant the more the time passes the more the schoolarship increases.
If so we'll can manage to pay with the help of God in our farming.
09/12/23, 12:51 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In a way you are correct, Shall I elaborate to you about the Earn While You Learn program, for better clarity?
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - +260 97 2413156: Yes please
09/12/23, 12:53 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

09/12/23, 12:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.

09/12/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
09/12/23, 1:16 pm - +260 97 2413156: I'm looking forwarding to the amazing experience of the education I'll acquire and the EWYL program that I've been made aware of today and of course meeting new people that will help me academical during my stay thier..
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So now please share your understanding of this picture with me!
09/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:54 pm - +260 97 2413156: From this picture I understand that the main idea of the EDOOFA CYCLE has is divided into six parts in the process of acquiring the schoolarship.
The first process is personalized counseling session were you talk about your personal life.
The second one is the second one is an interview that if you are eligible for the schoolarship or not.
The third they accept into the program inclusion it is just table that shows the processes that take place when obtaining the schoolarship.
09/12/23, 2:25 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly noted please
09/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 1: It’s basically the counselling process with the senior career counsellor who will help you with the information related to the Edoofa Program and help you prepare for the Eligibility Interview
09/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 2: It is the eligibility check process where you will be interviewed by the Program Director to examine your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
09/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 3: Once you clear the Eligibility Interview with the Program Director you will receive an Acceptance Letter from Edoofa. It is after this step that you have to pay the $350 enrollment fees Within the 7 day period of receiving the acceptance letter.
09/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 4: This step is about the enrollment into the Edoofa Program.
09/12/23, 2:31 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
09/12/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 2:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
 *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.* <This message was edited>
09/12/23, 2:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
09/12/23, 2:36 pm - +260 97 2413156: I do not have any questions sir.
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That’s great, So now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, a few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling:
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1. *Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counsellors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 4. *Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.
09/12/23, 2:48 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So which thing do you find the most interesting about Edoofa, from the points mentioned above and why?
09/12/23, 2:53 pm - +260 97 2413156: I have found the *Higher Education Concierge* to be most interesting.
09/12/23, 3:16 pm - Shubham Madhwal: As education is one of the crucial and important decisions of life where you have to be mentally and financially prepared. May I know who will be helping you in this process ahead?
09/12/23, 3:17 pm - +260 97 2413156: My parents are they ones who are going to help me..

09/12/23, 3:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: That's really good. Now as I have mentioned about the various benefits that you get once you enrol with Edoofa earlier, did I tell you that a student also saves around $1000-$1500 in College Application fees when affiliated with Edoofa?
09/12/23, 3:20 pm - +260 97 2413156: Yess you did
09/12/23, 3:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me tell you For Admission forms, a student on average may end up paying *$1000-$1500*. For a Statement of Purpose (SOP), the cost is between *$300-$500*.
Edoofa also helps you with Visa Documentation, University Selection, and sessions, Seels Learning Centre (SLC) classes, etc, All these facilities would cost you more than *$2000* without Edoofa, but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad *for only $350*. This $350 is the Edoofa enrollment fee.
09/12/23, 4:14 pm - +260 97 2413156: So if I get the EDOOFA schoolarship I'll only be required to pay $350 only
09/12/23, 4:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Let me help you understand better for your clarity!
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please *The enrollment fee is charged to you for*:

1. Edoofa provides foster care to all its students. This is more like a family with health insurance, mentor assistance, and counsellor help. The enrollment fee includes the Application forms, SOPs, visa assistance, University sessions, etc

2. We offer a comprehensive training program on Employability Skills for the entire course. The Earn While You Learn Program, is a department where the child learns skills and also gets an opportunity to earn $50-$100 per month. 

3. The guaranteed 50-100% Scholarship we offer to our students.
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 4:21 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Earlier the enrollment fee was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
09/12/23, 4:25 pm - +260 97 2413156: Noted.
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: *Phase 3:* Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
09/12/23, 4:26 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 4:33 pm - +260 96 3297443: Sure well noted ,we shall be able to do as the final conculission will be,we look forward to the gud outcome and we read to work hand in hand with Edoofa management for the betterment of the future for our daughter Getrude
09/12/23, 4:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please!
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great, So now I will explain the entire process and the benefits that you receive once you are enrolled with Edoofa,

Once you enrol yourself with us, I will start your admission process and assign your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. After that, we will connect you with the universities to clear all your doubts and also if the university has any questions for you.
09/12/23, 4:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: We have experience working with over 250+ universities and with that experience, you will have a proper admission expert assisting you with your admission. Edoofa's academic team will help the students to have university sessions to enable them to get admission via our scholarship fund. (This process also happens while the students remain in their home country and they receive letters from the University directly).

Once the university sessions are over, students will secure the Admission offer letter (LOI) from the respective universities based on Edoofa's recommendation at the end you will be given multiple admission offer letters from the top universities which are applicable for your course and hence you will have the freedom to choose the university in which you will pursue your higher education.
09/12/23, 4:55 pm - +260 97 2413156: Noted.

09/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 1.Well Edoofa Scholarship Program is an innovative program initiated by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. under the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative that solves the problems of Affordability and Employability in Higher Education by enabling students to Earn Scholarship Credits and Learn 21st century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, Edoofians are provided 50-100% scholarships to study their dream courses alongside working on live projects that help them earn scholarship credits. We help African students in self-financing their Education.
In short, The Edoofa Program, through the SEELS initiative, is bridging the gap between Financial Aid, College Education and Employability.
09/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 2. For the selected students who are able to qualify for the *EDOOFA Program* by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to *$2000-$3000* per year. This cost includes:

1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
09/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: 3. let me tell you dear the *enrollment fee* was $750 but due to this pandemic, we understand the problem faced so we have initiated the relief package so now the cost is reduced to $350 and is to be paid once you are found eligible for the program and then your earn while you learn will start and other parts then you can by your scholarship credits. The enrollment fees have to be paid Within the 7-day period of receiving this letter.
09/12/23, 6:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 6:44 pm - +260 97 2413156: Thank you sir I now understand.

11/12/23, 7:38 pm - +260 96 3297443: 1.My daughter wants to study B.Tech computer science and engineering 

2. India

3.$6000-$8000

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent.

SECTION 6
It all started on the 24th January,2023,a woman named Thembiso Magajana came to school with the aim of visiting as sci to her surprise she noticed that thier was lack of materials just such of computers because they were not enough.
Thembiso Magajana with her heart filled with pity decided to donate a number of computers and laptops besides that she introduced a computer coding programs to the school.
Thembiso was happy to see how girls were so serious with school and she said to the girls that it was her dream to educate a lot of girls and would love to school girl children reaching very far in life,Thembiso 
also said that she first used a computer from Njase girls'secondary school so she would love to see other girls become successful.
She really inspired me cause I had never come a person who was really interested in empowering women,she also said that she was running a social codding organization with some well-wishers supporting her and she also said that she once worked for gold man sucks.
Miss Magajana left Zambia and went back to her county which is South Africa whilst
we continued with the program the program was meant to teach as her to code and how to design websites.Njase girls' secondary school ensured that the girls did their level best in participating in the program.
I personally ensured that I really worked hard as owing to the fact that I come from not a very well to do family cause she was going to award the people that were going to come out 1st in the hackathon.
For this competition we were put in groups of 5 each.
When the day of the hackathon come the was a lot of people were buzzing with excitement as to who will the hackathon.
when it was time for the hackathon to begin thier was a lot tense in the atmosphere my group mates and I were very nervous because some of us hard never presented in front of an audience the thing that was making us more anxious is that a lot of important people were coming such as the president and the minister of education due it being the first social codding program to be introduced in the country.
Time came for the presentation to start and the first people to come on word was the president and his people inclusive of the headmaster this made us very nervous but we told ourselves that we can do it no matter how comes or what comes our way.
The last and final challenge was the most challenging amongst all we were told to make a huge robot and ensure that it moves.
This was no big deal for our group because we used to make them in every class we had so we made sure we did as they asked and submitted to the adjudicators while everyone was it working on thier this earned us a lot of marks.
Then to time come for the announcement of results and the first position went to the other group which was the North codders
my group mates and I cried cause we don't know were we went wrong till now.
