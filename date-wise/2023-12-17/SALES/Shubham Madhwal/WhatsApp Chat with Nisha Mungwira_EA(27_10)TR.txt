27/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Thank you
27/10/23, 1:35 pm - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

27/10/23, 1:35 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
27/10/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 344 7888: I appreciate your insight into the purpose of the scholarship program. I agree that it is important for students to take responsibility for their own education and help their families financially. I am grateful for the opportunity to apply for the scholarship.
27/10/23, 1:43 pm - Tushti: Alright so Nisha, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background.

27/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 344 7888: My name is Nisha, and I am a hardworking and dedicated student. My strengths include my ability to persevere through challenges and my strong work ethic. In my free time, I enjoy singing and reading a variety of  books. My family background is very important to me, and I come from a middle-class family who has always prioritized education and hard work.While we may not have a lot of money, we have always made sure to support each other and work together to achieve our goals.
27/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 344 7888: 1.) L5 and combination is Maths, biology and chemistry
2.)I would like to study medicine because I want to make a positive impact on people's lives

27/10/23, 2:22 pm - Tushti: Thank you for your lovely introduction, dear. It is a pleasure indeed to know more about you and your family
27/10/23, 2:23 pm - Tushti: Can you please elaborate the third answer? What do you mean when you say your father is self employed?
27/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Well my father is a tomato seller and his work as a tomato seller has taught me the value of hard work and self-sufficiency. Although it is not an easy job, I have seen how it has provided for our family and given us a sense of independence. I admire my father's dedication and determination, and I hope to emulate those qualities in my own life.
27/10/23, 2:37 pm - Tushti: Thank you for elaborating
27/10/23, 2:37 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your parents to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are your parents facing such a situation?
27/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 344 7888: My family is definitely facing financial difficulties. However, we are resilient and determined to overcome these challenges. I'm very grateful for the opportunity to apply for this scholarship, which would help me continue my studies and reach my goals. I'm committed to making the most of this opportunity, no matter what obstacles we face .
27/10/23, 2:46 pm - Tushti: I am pleased to hear that
27/10/23, 2:47 pm - Tushti: Now, may I have your O Level results for evaluation?

27/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 344 7888: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 2:59 pm - Tushti: Thank you
27/10/23, 2:59 pm - Tushti: So, have you done any research about the A Level subject requirements for Medicine?
27/10/23, 3:11 pm - +263 77 344 7888: From what I know I have been told that maths , biology and chemistry are required.
27/10/23, 3:16 pm - Tushti: Nisha, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
27/10/23, 3:16 pm - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
27/10/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 344 7888: So with the subjects that I study can I study any of the courses above?
27/10/23, 3:21 pm - Tushti: Yes
27/10/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Can I choose?
27/10/23, 3:37 pm - Tushti: Yes, please choose the course which best aligns with your vision and goals
27/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 344 7888: I opt for number 3
27/10/23, 3:53 pm - Tushti: May I know why you chose this course?
27/10/23, 3:58 pm - +263 77 344 7888: I chose to study Medical Laboratory Technology because I'm fascinated by the science of medicine and the role of laboratory testing in diagnosing and treating disease. I believe that this field will allow me to make a meaningful contribution to the health and well-being of others, which is very important to me.
27/10/23, 3:59 pm - Tushti: I see
27/10/23, 3:59 pm - Tushti: Let me brief you about the course
27/10/23, 4:00 pm - Tushti: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science.

27/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Thank you
27/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 344 7888: I'm more interested in the course now
27/10/23, 4:06 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
27/10/23, 4:18 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Five years after completing my Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology, I see myself working in a laboratory, using my skills to diagnose and treat patients. I believe that the Edoofa program can help me achieve my dreams by providing me with the financial support I need to complete my studies. I'm confident that with this opportunity, I can make a difference in the lives of others and contribute to the advancement of medical science.
27/10/23, 4:19 pm - Tushti: That is really great Nisha, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
27/10/23, 4:25 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Thank you for your kind words. I understand that pursuing a career in medical laboratory technology will require hard work and dedication, and I'm prepared to give my all to achieve my goals. I'm passionate about this field and committed to taking advantage of every opportunity to learn and grow. I know that with hard work and perseverance, I can achieve great things in this field.
27/10/23, 4:26 pm - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
27/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 344 7888: While I'm grateful for the educational opportunities in my home country, I believe that studying abroad will give me access to new experiences and perspectives that will broaden my understanding of the field. Studying abroad will also give me the chance to meet people from different backgrounds and cultures, which will help me become a well-rounded individual. I feel that these experiences will be invaluable in my future career .
27/10/23, 5:00 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

Additionally, I'm interested in experiencing the rich culture and heritage of India, which I believe will broaden my perspective and give me a deeper understanding of the world.

30/10/23, 10:22 am - Tushti: That's great

30/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 344 7888: Thank you for sharing all the wonderful things about studying in India. It's clear that India has a lot to offer. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity to learn more about it.
30/10/23, 11:09 am - Tushti: I can see that you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
30/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 344 7888: I'm not familiar with the exact cost of similar quality education for an international student in India, but I appreciate you giving me more information about the value that Edoofa provides. I'm very excited to learn more about this opportunity and explore all of my options for higher education.
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
30/10/23, 11:26 am - Tushti: In simple words Nisha, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
30/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 344 7888: I'm really impressed by the Earn While You Learn Program. It seems like a really creative and effective way to help students finance their education.
30/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Let me brief you about the course
30/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Nisha, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
30/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
30/10/23, 11:51 am - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

30/10/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/10/23, 11:59 am - +263 77 344 7888: This is really eye-opening! I had no idea that there was a program like this that could help me finance my education while also gaining valuable skills and experience.
30/10/23, 11:59 am - Tushti: I am delighted to hear that
30/10/23, 11:59 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
30/10/23, 11:59 am - Tushti: Nisha, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
30/10/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 344 7888: If I multiply 5 by $300 the student will have to pay $1 500 and if I multiply $450 by 5 the student will have to pay $2 250
30/10/23, 12:07 pm - Tushti: Exactly Nisha, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
30/10/23, 12:08 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 12:08 pm - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
30/10/23, 12:08 pm - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
30/10/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Wow, I'm really impressed by the services that Edoofa offers. The Earn While You Learn Program is a very helpful and innovative solution for students. Thank you so much for sharing this information.
30/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
30/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: Nisha, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
30/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
30/10/23, 12:22 pm - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Yes I'm able to understand, thank you.
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 12:28 pm - Tushti: Alright Nisha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
30/10/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
30/10/23, 12:29 pm - Tushti: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
30/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Yes I have understood
30/10/23, 12:32 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Thank you Ms Tushti
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
30/10/23, 12:34 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
30/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 344 7888: Thanks so much for the information. I'm ready to move on to the Eligibility Check
30/10/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Okay
30/10/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
30/10/23, 12:38 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow Mr. Shubham* would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Topic: What is life in Rwanda like 16 years after the genocide there?

The 1994 genocide in Rwanda was a terrible event that devastated the country. Since then, the people of Rwanda have faced many challenges, but they have worked hard to rebuild their country. This essay will explore the challenges faced by the people of Rwanda, the efforts they have made to overcome these challenges, and the hope they have for the future.


The challenges faced by the people of Rwanda have been numerous. One of the most significant challenges has been the need to heal the wounds of the past. The genocide left deep scars on the people of Rwanda, and it has been a long and difficult process to rebuild trust and create a sense of unity. Another major challenge has been the task of rebuilding the country's economy. The genocide caused a significant decline in economic activity, and it has taken time to get the economy back on track. Despite these challenges, the people of Rwanda have shown great resilience and determination.


In the face of these challenges, the people of Rwanda have made great strides in rebuilding their country. One of the most significant achievements has been the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. This commission has helped to promote healing and understanding between the different groups in Rwanda. Another key achievement has been the rebuilding of the country's infrastructure. This has included the rebuilding of roads, hospitals, and schools. These efforts have helped to create a more stable and secure environment in Rwanda.


In spite of the progress that has been made, there are still many challenges facing the people of Rwanda. One of the most pressing challenges is the issue of poverty. Despite the economic growth that has occurred, a large percentage of the population still lives in poverty. Another significant challenge is the issue of ethnic tensions. Although the government has made efforts to promote reconciliation, ethnic divisions still exist and need to be addressed.


In conclusion, the people of Rwanda have made great strides in rebuilding their country. They have faced many challenges, but have shown resilience and determination in overcoming them. Although there are still many challenges to overcome, there is hope for a brighter future. The people of Rwanda have shown that it is possible to move forward from even the most difficult of circumstances. They are an example to the world of what is possible when people come together and work towards a common goal.

My inspirational story


 I remember the day like it was yesterday. I was sitting in front of my computer, my heart pounding in my chest. I had just received the results of my form four exams, and I was terrified to look at them. Finally, I took a deep breath and clicked on the link. When I saw the results, I was shocked. I had passed every subject I couldn't believe it. This experience taught me that hard work pays off, and that I should never give up on my dreams.

From that day on, I was determined to continue working hard and pursuing my goals. I realized that I was capable of more than I thought, and that I could achieve anything I set my mind to. This experience taught me to believe in myself and to never give up on my dreams, no matter how difficult they may seem. It showed me the power of perseverance and hard work. And it was just the beginning of my journey.

Looking back, I'm so grateful for that moment of doubt and fear. It was the catalyst that pushed me to work even harder and to pursue my goals with even more determination. It was the turning point in my life, and it led me to where I am today. Without that experience, I wouldn't be the person I am today. It taught me the true meaning of perseverance and hard work, and it showed me the power of believing in myself.

In the end, the experience of passing my form four exams taught me so much about myself and about the importance of hard work and perseverance. It showed me that we are all capable of more than we think, and that anything is possible if we set our minds to it. I will never forget that moment, and I will always carry the lessons it taught me with me.

17/11/23, 9:18 am - +263 77 327 3719: Yes
17/11/23, 9:19 am - Shubham Madhwal: So I hope you have gone through Nisha's acceptance letter?
17/11/23, 9:21 am - +263 77 327 3719: Yes we have
17/11/23, 9:28 am - Shubham Madhwal: Mr and Mrs Mungwira @263772968210 @263773273719,. As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Nisha was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Nisha's potential. I firmly believe that if students like her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
17/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 77 327 3719: Thank you for the consideration
17/11/23, 10:20 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would likee to ask from Nisha's acceptance letter?
17/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 327 3719: I want to ask about the enrollment fee
17/11/23, 1:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you elaborate on your question?
17/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 327 3719: I want to ask that can you please add more days for me before I pay the enrollment fee
17/11/23, 1:49 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Ok, May I know the issues you are facing in detail?
17/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 327 3719: I am facing financial issues and I am trying to strike a balance between the school fees of all my children and the enrollment fee
17/11/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 327 3719: May I know if Nisha got 50% scholarship or  100% scholarship ?
17/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Please Like I shared above Nisha has gotten a higher quantum of scholarship that's why the cost of education is reduced to $1200-$1800 annual which can be further brought down by Nisha is she works hard in the Earn While You Learn program
17/11/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 327 3719: Okay noted with thanks

22/11/23, 3:41 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263773273719 @263772968210 with all due respect I understand your situation, honestly, there are certain instances in our life which are beyond our control, and in fact, we as human beings cannot plan for them as well.
22/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I also understand the financial commitment and hardships it takes for a parent to educate their child. But because of that, you cannot neglect the importance of quality education. Knowing the situation back there in Africa, the majority of students after completing their bachelor's degree have no guarantee of employment security.
22/11/23, 3:43 pm - Shubham Madhwal: I can suggest an alternative fee completion plan for Nisha such that considering this plan it would be convenient for you to secure her seat and at the same time you would not be financially burdened, @263773273719 @263772968210
