16/12/23, 12:38 pm - +260 97 4813102: We totally agree with you. And we have noted also the cost of the selected students who qualify for the EDOOFA Program
16/12/23, 12:57 pm - Shubham Madhwal: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
16/12/23, 1:01 pm - +260 97 4813102: This is beautiful, given a chance , hard work should be my goal.
16/12/23, 1:11 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So shall I now update you about the Earn While You Learn Program?
16/12/23, 1:12 pm - +260 97 4813102: Yes, we are here
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
16/12/23, 1:37 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
16/12/23, 1:40 pm - +260 97 4813102: Very well understood sir
16/12/23, 4:33 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Good day everyone Please excuse me for being unavailable. I was facing technical issues today because of which I was unable to conduct your session today. I hope you will understand.

We will now connect on Monday at 10:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!
