*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
07/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Good afternoon
07/12/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Tawananyasha,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
07/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 379 7485: Mr Gurvinder, how are you
07/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Its a pleasure

07/12/23, 2:47 pm - +263 77 379 7485: I am fine
07/12/23, 2:50 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Tawananyasha, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Ariel, is that correct?
07/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes sir
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ariel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Ariel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
07/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok ,i have learnt that Edoofa ha recommended a program whereby its offering schoolarships to Zimbabweans within three years if im not mistaken,ranging from 50 -100% of their tuition fee ,hence helping many students to study as they face many problems during higher education like that of financial difficulties so you help by making it affordable so as to persue the dreams of the students
You also have three aspects which can ensure one to be a winner and successful which are Knowledge ,skills and attitudes

About Ariel's journey with Edoofa, he has managed to get a scholarship n persue his tertiary education in India which will help him learn and as well earn as he's persuing his education and for him to get the schoolarship he managed to follow the 5'S which helped him qualify

Thank you
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I see you are well informed.
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: But let me also brief you about the program.
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
07/12/23, 3:18 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
07/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you
07/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes, it is
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - +263 73 736 4250: That would be a great honor
07/12/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Tawananyasha, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
07/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes i do
07/12/23, 3:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now Tawananyasha, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
07/12/23, 3:54 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok

08/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?

08/12/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
08/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yeah true, thank you
08/12/23, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
08/12/23, 2:03 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok sir
Im very confident
08/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
08/12/23, 2:33 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes please
08/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law. This course goes beyond the tedious classroom learning. The time spent during this course is made interesting by constantly organizing the case studies and mock court drills alongside theoretical lectures.
08/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: In *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* course, the focus is on developing skills that will help the students to tackle any kind of legal problem they may face in the future. The objective of this course is to equip the students with an expert knowledge and a unique perspective on it. It enables the students to think critically in a creative way and come up with innovative ideas to tackle the aforesaid legal issues.
08/12/23, 2:38 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is meant for candidates who are suitable for concise writing, verbal questioning and complex information interpretation. The aspirants having a strong evaluation and analytical skills can be a good fit for this course.

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
08/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

Have a great weekend
11/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Education is the passport to the future, for tomorrow belongs to those who prepare for it today."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
11/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 73 736 4250: Goodmorning Mr Gurvinder
11/12/23, 9:38 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Tawananyasha, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
11/12/23, 9:42 am - +263 73 736 4250: Yes sir
11/12/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
11/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 73 736 4250: Ok
I want to study abroad firstly because its just my dream and aim to go outside and mostly in my country the fees are expensive and most of all, most people after having their degrees go jobless so it will be of no use studying here
I believe that as soon as i finish my program abroad i will get a job right away and especially Edoofa which helps one to learn and earn at the same time, so it will be the greatest opportunity of all
11/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 73 736 4250: It will also be an advantage so as to help my mother with the expenses as of my situation
11/12/23, 10:36 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
11/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 73 736 4250: Yes sir, you are right

When i finish my education abroad, first of all i will be a role model of others which will make people ring a bell in their heads that
1. They must also copy the education system from abroad as it gives many opportunities hence if they also offer such opportunities in mt country it will surely develop
2. Campaigns as well as enlightening people about my own journey out there so as to help develop our education system
And most of all once im a successful lawyer my knowledge and skills will also help develop my country and as well fight to change its education system so as for the future generation
11/12/23, 10:50 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Tawananyasha, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
11/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 73 736 4250: Yes sir i agree
11/12/23, 10:57 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
11/12/23, 10:59 am - +263 73 736 4250: Yeah, please enlighten me a little more
11/12/23, 10:59 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

*Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

11/12/23, 11:08 am - +263 73 736 4250: I agree with him now, they are great offers in India
11/12/23, 12:16 pm - Gurvinder: So now Tawananyasha, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
11/12/23, 12:18 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes please
So after completing the education, can one find employment in India or one has to go back to his home country
11/12/23, 12:50 pm - Gurvinder: Tawananyasha, in the final year of the course every student in the University gets multiple chances of securing a good job within India itself as all the Universities have Employment Partners which provide students with good paying job! <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok i get it
Thank you
11/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
11/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 73 736 4250: No, can you please help with that
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 1:46 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 1:59 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Thank you
11/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Tawananyasha what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
11/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok
So this program of earning while i learn, will i be wrking a job related to my program and how much will i be earning
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 2:23 pm - Gurvinder: Tawananyasha, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok i understand now
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
11/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
11/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Its great program
It will Truly benefit me as i will be employable even the same day i finish my program as well as being affordable
11/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Im sorry for the late response sir
11/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Some experience will surely do before finishing the program henceforth thumbs up for the EWYL program
11/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Tawananyasha, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
11/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Wow
Ok i understand
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
11/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 73 736 4250: So the earning basically depends on the percentage of your scholarship, am i correct?

11/12/23, 2:58 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
11/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Wow
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tawananyasha, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Exactly what i have been looking for
11/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes that's true
11/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
11/12/23, 3:24 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes i had with my mother, since it has always been a dream to study abroad
We were to find out the prices of the affordable universities outside but luckily my friend Ariel introduced me to the Edoofa program and it's now easier and today as i was chatting with you i was as well discussing with my mother all the fees u have told me
11/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 379 7485: Good afternoon, Mr Gurvinder, i have been following your conversations with Tawananyasha, and i understand its a good programme, Tawananyasha has always been eager to learn abroad and also work there. She has always talked about going abroad for work
11/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
11/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
11/12/23, 3:31 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes sir
11/12/23, 3:32 pm - Gurvinder: Tawananyasha as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
11/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 73 736 4250: $1500-$2250
11/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Tawananyasha, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
11/12/23, 3:34 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok sir
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: Tawananyasha basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 73 736 4250: That's affordable
11/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
11/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Ok sir i understand
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Im not quite familiar
11/12/23, 3:38 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Tawananyasha, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
11/12/23, 3:39 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - +263 73 736 4250: Yes i have understood sir
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
11/12/23, 3:40 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
11/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - +263 73 736 4250: For now No
I have understood quite well
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
11/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
11/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes.

Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide 

The genocide heavily disrupted and destroyed the lives of the people. Families were destroyed hence causing high rate of orphans and widows, many women were also victims of rape and it caused impoverished population as 2 million people also fled from the country .Due to the destruction of infrastructure the ones left were jobless, homeless making life soo difficult which made people question why Rwanda would undergo something devastating as that. Rwanda faced intense demographic pressure, the shortage of land and lack of access to the Indian Ocean hence being the three critical problems in Rwanda's economic development. However, against all odds Rwanda has made remarkable strides in the years since, showing resilience and determination. Despite the lasting scars, Rwanda's journey of healing and reconciliation and development stands as an inspiring testament to the unyielding spirit of its people. 
Now as of date residents of Rwanda enjoy low corruption and high quality of life making the country ideal.

My inspirational story

Im a girl aged 18 and life was not that easy with me as i grew up but who knew that i could grow up to be a young dedicated and focused girl. Let me take you back a little, i was raised by a single mother from the word go and things were not easy at all since i was a baby, luckily later on she found a job and could take good care of the little Tawananyasha. I faced so many hardships in life as i never knew how to call the word "daddy." In school, some would mock me as most students have both parents but that did not let me down but rather made me a very strong lady I am today. Because of the sad situation I have become dedicated especially in my school work so as to become successful and give back to my mother whom i thank with ny whole life everyday. Some could say having one parent is the end of life and one might even drop out of school but here am I about to go  proceed with my education with that one parent so any situation can be overcomed one has to just stand firm and see a positive way out. Having challenges in life doesn't mean life has come to an end but rather challenges are there to make people stronger, sometimes i come to think that if i had two parents maybe i would be spoiled and less focused but having my challenge has made me who i am today, a young strong lady and im thankful for that. Due to my situation i have managed to Join the Leo club which serves those in need especially orphans, i have realized and come to know how hard life can be with one parent what of those without any, so i am into serving those in need. All i can say is never give up in life as success awaits ahead and let us look at challenges as tests in life which makes us great and let us give back to the community
