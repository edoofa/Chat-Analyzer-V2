We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
14/12/23, 10:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.
14/12/23, 10:24 am - Shubham Madhwal: Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.

16/12/23, 4:36 pm - +260 97 1819712: I chali Ramon hope my expression about my self meet at least the level of your expectation.
Here it goes.                                                               

     Iam a person whose optimistic,goal oriented and persistent at any interest of my work.I  do play football not taken as a career but a way of exercising my mental and physical body.looking at how people in the society live,many have conditions or heart related issues which hinders one to do or achieve work effectively.I was compelled to the matter and thought of persuing a course under Technology which happens to be cardiovascular Technology.
     Secondly, My highest level of education is O level/grade 12 ,I completed in 2018 at kafushi secondary school graduating with good results as a consequence of quality education offered there.
     Therefore,The course of study as stated in introduction I would like to persue is cardiovascular Technology,This course will not only help me as an individual but the globe at large, contributing to the industry under Technology through gathered information and research.
     However,my parents and myself are business oriented people.We have a poultry on which we depend on for our survival and I do sell electronic gadgets and apparel for my upkeep.
      Neverless,my father's current level edubcation is A level.He persued a course in Adult Education graduating with a degree but still not employed.                      My Mother's level of education is currently O level.
      My father and Mother have been sponsoring me since childhood untill date.They have supported me with everything they had untill my graduation to grade 12
   However,Out of 100% I rate only 20% can my parents afford concerning finances .At the look of our situation at home my parents cannot meet the requirements needed to cover up my finances.
      Further more, come from a family of 6 of which children we're 4 and I Am  the second born.two of my siblings are still doing there O level education and My elder brother just graduated from school with a diploma in clinical officing.
    Lastly I am currently not in any academic activities due to insufficient funds,that's more of a reason why I applied for Edoofa scholarship program.
    This is a brief introduction of my self and family inclusive .. Thank you.
