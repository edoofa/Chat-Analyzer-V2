I really want to know more about it
09/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: Let me elaborate you about the program
09/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
09/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 


The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2500+ Zimbabwean who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
09/12/23, 11:01 am - Arshita: *I hope you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child, aren't you?*
09/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 77 300 3697: Interesting and l can take the offer if there is an opportunity availed
09/12/23, 11:13 am - Arshita: Good to hear that! 

Can you please share more about Musingafi, what kind of child he is, his qualifications and career aspirations?
09/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 77 300 3697: He obtained 9 subjects at o level and he's waiting for his A level results and his combination was Maths, Statistics,  Computer science and Business studies.  I think this compination suits Computer Engineering/ Software Engineering
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Arshita: Good to know about him!
09/12/23, 11:29 am - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is 2 A level passes, we always encourage our students to aim for maximum so that they get a higher quantum of scholarship. 

I hope you are confident about him achieving it.
09/12/23, 11:56 am - +263 77 300 3697: Which is good news
09/12/23, 11:56 am - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in him studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 300 3697: Haven't researched and applied but need assistance
09/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

13/12/23, 11:50 am - +263 71 780 5827: No
13/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
13/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 11:52 am - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?

13/12/23, 12:03 pm - Arshita: I can understand that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
13/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Can u clarify on earn while you earn programme to reduce the fees
13/12/23, 12:05 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Proceed
13/12/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
13/12/23, 12:09 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
13/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
13/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu

13/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:10 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
13/12/23, 12:12 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Yes
13/12/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
13/12/23, 12:14 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Yeah
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *2. Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Arshita: So after going through the facts that make Edoofa different,
Let me know which point out of the 4 you like the most.
13/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 780 5827: 2 and 4
13/12/23, 12:22 pm - Arshita: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on affordability and maximum exposures
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

13/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Exactly
13/12/23, 12:26 pm - Arshita: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
However, may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/12/23, 12:28 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Okay
13/12/23, 12:30 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
13/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 71 780 5827: My parents
13/12/23, 12:32 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 780 5827: They really appreciate that .
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
13/12/23, 12:37 pm - +263 71 780 5827: That's all I know and the application form attached with Ordinary and Advanced Level Results
13/12/23, 12:38 pm - Arshita: Absolutely correct
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Yes
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
13/12/23, 12:43 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Col
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Okay
13/12/23, 12:46 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
13/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Ok
13/12/23, 12:51 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 71 780 5827: ✅
13/12/23, 12:52 pm - Arshita: Please answer this
13/12/23, 12:54 pm - +263 71 780 5827: 01
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/12/23, 12:58 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Yes
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
13/12/23, 12:59 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
13/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 780 5827: It's clear
13/12/23, 5:50 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

14/12/23, 12:51 pm - Austin: I do understand, Edoofa Scholarship Program offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees and even Accommodation for selected students
14/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 77 300 3697: Okay meaning t chances of getting full payment is slim?
14/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 300 3697: However we're not rejecting the offer but our wish is to get full payment for his fees
14/12/23, 1:08 pm - Austin: The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship

14/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 780 5827: Well, this was only possible for the students to earn a handsome amount of scholarship credits because they were constantly in touch with their mentors for their skill development, and repeatedly asked for more projects and assignments to be done, which in return helped them to earn such an amount of scholarship credits in a year. earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on families? programmed designed for the students which allows them to learn while they earn inorder to have some money to add to the school fees .
14/12/23, 2:45 pm - Austin: 5) *Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While You Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together.

14/12/23, 2:48 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:48 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:49 pm - Austin: Dear parents @263773897691 @263773003697 ,Before proceeding further, we would like to ensure that you are fully aligned and supportive of the career path of your child. Please go through the letter from our Program Director addressed to the parents of our applicants. Your role in your child's higher education is significant with moral and financial support, and your active participation is greatly appreciated.

 We will begin the eligibility check process today and you can expect the results in the coming days. *If your child's application is found eligible, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within the 7-day timeframe or as per the payment plan($200 in 7 days and $150 in 30 days)?* Your acknowledgement is expected at the earliest and is mandatory to proceed. Let me know if you have any challenges.
14/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 300 3697: Yeah l think the time to raise such an amount is too short
14/12/23, 3:20 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check stage of your child today, it would be of 1-2 days after which the results will be out which means if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall by the end of the next week of December. Are you confident and comfortable with the timeframe?
14/12/23, 4:46 pm - Austin: @263773003697 , you can feel free to share your thoughts so that I can guide you further accordingly
14/12/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 300 3697: Give us 2weeks
14/12/23, 8:26 pm - Austin: That would be a long timeframe @263773003697 , but considering your challenges, if I request a payment plan for you in such a way that you can pay $100 in 7 days and $100 in another 7 days, will it be feasible for you?
15/12/23, 12:57 pm - Austin: Good Day to you all!
