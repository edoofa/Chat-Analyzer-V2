In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

01/12/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Cleave, Please note that the exact cost of education per semester varies depending on your university and the quantum of scholarship. As mentioned , it ranges $2000-$3000 per annum which means the cost of education per semesters ranges $1000-$1500
01/12/23, 3:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: The first semester is from August to December and the second from January to May after which you have two months of summer vacation

01/12/23, 3:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
01/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 78 602 7126: L would love that and guess what l was about to ask that sure🙏🙏 Sir l don't know how it's done..
01/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 78 602 7126: This is me sir thus what am exactly looking for💯
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Cleave, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
01/12/23, 4:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
01/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*

02/12/23, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

*Success is a journey, not a destination.*

On this positive note, shall we begin with your session?
02/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 602 7126: Greetings.. yes let's begin
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed, You can also achieve that!!
02/12/23, 10:21 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, 


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 78 602 7126: Am fine  ... How are you ..
02/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 78 602 7126: Thus the plan and with the Edoofa scholarship l believe it's possible
02/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 78 602 7126: 😱😱 what ? That is good news  ...indeed Edoofa scholarship is affordable and helpful to all ..
02/12/23, 10:28 am - +263 78 602 7126: So every student under the Edoofa scholarship get the chance to earn or work while doing school work ..
02/12/23, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes Cleave
02/12/23, 10:31 am - Pallika Edoofa: Now, As we are proceeding towards the end of the session, let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
02/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 602 7126: Firstly the idea of earn while you learn, l love it  career counseling, it helps a student to follow the right path, travel guidance, visa and fee payment we really need guidance we cannot do it alone..most importantly the minimum scholarship of 50 _ 100%
02/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 602 7126: L have a question ma'am  .. What is the different between Sociology and Social work?
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Cleave, Certainly! Sociology is a social science discipline that studies society, human behavior, and social institutions. It analyzes patterns, relationships, and structures within societies. On the other hand, social work is a profession focused on helping individuals and communities enhance their well-being. Social workers often address specific issues such as poverty, mental health, and family dynamics, using a combination of advocacy, counseling, and support services. While sociology is more theoretical and research-oriented, social work is more practical and intervention-focused.
02/12/23, 11:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on Earn while you learn and Career counseling session

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

02/12/23, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
02/12/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 602 7126: My parents will be helping
02/12/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 602 7126: Tnank you
02/12/23, 11:19 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
02/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 78 602 7126: Thanks  sir  so sociology is better than social work even in terms of earning?
02/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 78 602 7126: They love the idea but they are afraid because they felt it's very expensive they may not be able to afford it ...but l know they will be happy after telling them about the earn while learn program🙏because it will reduce the cost..
02/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Cleave

04/12/23, 10:07 pm - +263 78 602 7126: OK sir  thanks
05/12/23, 8:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you are doing well today,

Shall we begin the session now?
05/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Yes  how are u
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am doing great!
05/12/23, 2:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason for the delay?
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 602 7126: L found a job so the shifts  are hard..its 7 to 7
05/12/23, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Cleave, I understand!
05/12/23, 3:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Please note that studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
05/12/23, 3:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
05/12/23, 3:30 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Thus it indeed
05/12/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
05/12/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
05/12/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 3:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
05/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Thus trick though have no option
05/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Yes
05/12/23, 3:36 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Of course l understand
05/12/23, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
05/12/23, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: .However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
05/12/23, 3:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
05/12/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Didn't understand the issue of A level results phase 2
05/12/23, 3:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Cleave, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
05/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Thus true indeed
05/12/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 602 7126: l understand now
05/12/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great
05/12/23, 3:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Stage 1
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's right!!
05/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
05/12/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Exactly
05/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
05/12/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 78 602 7126: The process is done online with guidance of agencies.. Right
05/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 602 7126: OK sir
05/12/23, 4:12 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Thanks for the information Edoofa seems to be my destiny indeed🙏
05/12/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hope for the best!!
05/12/23, 4:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

06/12/23, 10:10 pm - Austin: So may I know what all discussions you had with your family with regard to the Edoofa Scholarship Program? You can share a summary and their thoughts after getting to know the program well.
06/12/23, 10:17 pm - +263 78 602 7126: We discussed the issue of earn while you learn , the fee payment and the issue of application process especially the help Edoofa scholarship offer to it's student's...

06/12/23, 10:19 pm - Austin: I am glad your family understands this opportunity's importance and the power to transform your career. So may I know if your family has any queries, please
06/12/23, 10:20 pm - Austin: Also, we are not an Education Agency rather an Education organization looking forward to affordability, accessibility and employability in education for deserving students
06/12/23, 10:26 pm - +263 78 602 7126: They are just curious to know about the amount they are supposed to arrange also in term of security is it a secured place ... Most important they want to know after getting a degree is there an opportunity for the organization to help u with the job in India ..
06/12/23, 10:27 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
06/12/23, 10:27 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
06/12/23, 10:28 pm - +263 78 602 7126: Ooh   wow thus awesome ...🫶
06/12/23, 10:28 pm - Austin: Being your parents, the concern regarding the welfare and personal development of their child is absolutely understandable. 

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!

With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*

The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

06/12/23, 10:30 pm - Austin: We are still working on the employability opportunities for our students. At the same time, we are preparing Edoofians throughout their course and through the Earn While You Learn Program so that they gain employability skills and practical learning so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate.
Our students will be working on different platforms which will enhance their communication, leadership, team management and other professional skills sought by the Industries. 

Once they complete they will already have hands-on experience on various projects and real-life situations and it would be much easier for them to be employable and receive jobs internationally.
06/12/23, 10:32 pm - +263 78 602 7126: OK l understand also sir how much is well the cost of a visa?

15/12/23, 4:56 pm - Austin: Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees. The final percentage of scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment

The percentage of scholarship is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extra curricular Activities

So the Universites will evaluate them to decide the final quantum of scholarship
15/12/23, 5:07 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from the University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600 <This message was edited>

15/12/23, 5:31 pm - Austin: Yes
15/12/23, 5:31 pm - Austin: If the student misses the enrollment fee, then the application will be revoked. Only the current round will be applicable for you and not other rounds
15/12/23, 5:32 pm - Austin: This is an assurance clause that states that every Edoofian will be receiving offer letters from Universities
15/12/23, 5:32 pm - Austin: That is correct
15/12/23, 5:33 pm - Austin: Our parent organization has worked with 250+ reputed Universities and Colleges in India. For your research and learnings let me share with you the details of some of our associate Universities

I am very much happy  to accept the great honour given to my son.
It's great welcome to us all as a family in large.We appreciate this.we were knowing  to ourself that Cleave will not be a failure. And  will not disappoint you.
I got this experience while he doing his upper secondary school.
His school headmaster always reminded us ,Cleave is a leader.Cleave is a winner.Cleave is a soldier who will not give up .Cleave is a moulder.
This was after he hearded the upper school as a headboy  and leads his teammates to a grorius performance both in ademics and in descipline.
Well done to you all the entire members of the Edofa scholarship programme.
As a parent lam now focusing on tuning for  the payment of the required enrollment fees before the due date.
I thank again and again.
