15/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
15/12/23, 11:14 am - +260 777828100: For my siblings not really they are not reason being is that my parents tries the best they can to make sure  that all my siblings go to school together with my cousin whom they are paying for

15/12/23, 12:37 pm - Tushti: Mr Richard, the cost of education abroad without scholarship would be around $7000 per year, which Edoofa can help bring down to about $2000 per year

15/12/23, 12:45 pm - +260 97 9795286: I can manage $1000 per year looking at the finances I receive and the people I'm looking after thanks

16/12/23, 12:55 pm - +260 777828100: Sir thank you for this information at least on what I know I have lent something knew this has also given me more reasons to study in India sir
16/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
16/12/23, 1:22 pm - +260 777828100: Yes of what my family and I know is that a person who is studying in India for medicine in India it's about it about 50,000 to about 200,000
16/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
16/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
16/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

16/12/23, 1:22 pm - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
16/12/23, 1:23 pm - Tushti: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
