I am 17 years old currently preparing for  upper six in 2024 at Lady Enarater International high school which is located in Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe.Lady Enarater high school is a reliable International private school which is paid USD 1300 per term. I am doing science subjects which are  maths,chemistry and biology because I believe that I am going to be a successful neurosurgeon in the next few years to come ,why? because i know there are lot of people out there who have debilitating conditions in our country and there are a few neurosurgeon who can help them so I believe I will be at help too if I was to add the number of neurosurgeon in our country and would gladly would be at help if i am to become International too. 
For my strengths ,my leadership skills are quite breathe taking says spectators' feedback because currently am a leader at Lady Enarater International high school, teamwork too,problem solving and communication too can count as I am seeing myself being a therapist and a neurosurgeon too.
As for my weaknesses ,one of them is being a highly sensitive person as I sometimes consider other people 's emotions rather than mine.
i am into music and reading a lot of books during my free time.
As I mentioned above ,I am the first born child in a family of two children, where the last born is a 11 year old boy at primary level right now preparing for his final year at primary level.My father and mother have been financially supporting my education ever since I stepped my way in kindergarten and they will  continue to do so until I'm in my graduation gown,but I also have plans in supporting them too as time goes by.My father is a pharmacy sales representative and my mother is a hair dresser who  Try their best everyday for our wellbeing.

15/12/23, 9:27 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Thank you for sharing such a detailed and inspiring introduction. It's evident that you have a clear vision for your future and are dedicated to pursuing a career as a neurosurgeon. Your commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others in Zimbabwe is commendable.
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Your strengths, particularly in leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and communication, are essential attributes for a successful career in medicine. It's great to see that you are already demonstrating these skills in your current role as a leader at Lady Enarater International high school.

15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Thank you
15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss 
I am working on that
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: Munashe, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
15/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 749 4463: So for my situation mathematics is not necessary??
15/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 749 4463: Because unfortunately for my case ,physics is not involved in the picture
15/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 749 4463: So is it possible for me to do Medicine without physics
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: It is not possible, dear
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: These are the courses that must now choose from
15/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 749 4463: Which are the 8 you listed above?
15/12/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Yes
16/12/23, 9:20 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yess we may
16/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: So, have you chosen the course you wish to pursue?
16/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 749 4463: Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology
16/12/23, 10:31 am - Tushti: What is reason for choosing this course?
16/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 749 4463: Well if I can't be a neurosurgeon it's okay 
Because it's already too late for me right to divert my subjects right now
But my goal too is to study and work in medicine 
So If not being a neurosurgeon why not be in medical laboratory technology 
Besides I'm really good in chemistry and biology 
So why not divert the broken dreams to something that may be to great help 
You never know unless you give it a try
16/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Very well!
16/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Let me brief you about the course
16/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 749 4463: Okay

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
16/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 749 4463: Oooh okay

16/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 749 4463: Sorry to ask a lot of questions 
So anyway anyhow 
I can't be a doctor?
In anyway?
16/12/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: With the subject combination you have, that is not possible
16/12/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: So, do you wish to proceed with this course?
16/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 749 4463: Okay
16/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss
16/12/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
16/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 749 4463: Okay thank you for this opportunity 
Firstly it would be a great honour if Edoofa's program was to offer me this opportunity in life to achieve my dreams as a young girl with a huge vision. My goal is to have further education overseas to gain great knowledge with dedication to wear what they call graduation gown with  either my degree or PHD in my hands hoping to have a high paying job as the future draws by as it might be impossible in our country due to circumstances.From my research,India is one of the best countries with high facilities in education especially when it comes to medical programs so I was like why not then.So it would be a dream come true as I see myself in 5 years time being one of the best medical laboratory technicians world wide and may be  effective in diagnosis and treatment of patients in my country too with great research and tests .And yes I see myself as one of the successful women in medicine too wide world because I know I have a vision and I am gonna achieve it .
16/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: That is really great Munashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,
