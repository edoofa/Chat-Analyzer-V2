30/09/23, 10:52 am - +91 72920 63289: That is great. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
30/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes let us go ahead
30/09/23, 11:00 am - +91 72920 63289: <Media omitted>
30/09/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 243 1666: I have gone through it, may you go ahead
30/09/23, 11:15 am - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
30/09/23, 11:15 am - +91 72920 63289: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
30/09/23, 11:16 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes there are
30/09/23, 11:26 am - +91 72920 63289: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
30/09/23, 11:26 am - +91 72920 63289: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
30/09/23, 11:46 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes l am following
30/09/23, 11:55 am - +91 72920 63289: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
30/09/23, 11:55 am - +91 72920 63289: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
30/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes there are
30/09/23, 12:05 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

06/10/23, 4:04 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing your understanding of the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
06/10/23, 4:04 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
06/10/23, 4:05 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
06/10/23, 4:05 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well received thank you
06/10/23, 4:08 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are welcome. Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
06/10/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes we are , we may go ahead
06/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 72920 63289: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
06/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 12:30 PM.
06/10/23, 4:14 pm - +91 72920 63289: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 243 1666: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions, and the academic documents. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
11/10/23, 1:40 pm - +91 72920 63289: To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe Pride wants to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science Engineering for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you
11/10/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 243 1666: That is correct
11/10/23, 1:53 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
11/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 243 1666: May I kindly be excused just for today I am not feeling well, am currently at the local health center  may  we start tomorrow
11/10/23, 2:00 pm - +91 72920 63289: Of course, your health is the top priority. Please take the time you need to recover. Feel free to connect in the evening, or else we can connect tomorrow at 12:30 pm.
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good day, l will
12/10/23, 12:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Pride.

I hope you are doing well, regarding our conversation yesterday, may I know if you are available to connect with us now and move ahead with our discussion since we were unable to continue yesterday?
12/10/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Good afternoon, yes we may continue
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
12/10/23, 2:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
12/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes true  you have to enroll in one of the universities
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
12/10/23, 2:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
12/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Sorry for delay in  response , have been in the EWYL session, on the same note trying to balance up with work
12/10/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes my counselor shared the information with me
12/10/23, 3:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: No problem at all. It's great to see your dedication to the EWYL session and balancing it with work.
12/10/23, 3:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just *$2000 to $3000 per year*. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes we are
12/10/23, 3:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
12/10/23, 3:21 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  have taken note
12/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
12/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
12/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following , am understanding that l should have  at 750 at hand so that  if l am offered a place l should pay, then when my child arrives in India she should have at least $1025 .
12/10/23, 3:42 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I appreciate the  way how you lay  out state of preparedness in terms of tution fee
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for your understanding and for acknowledging the financial aspects related to your child's education in India. It's important to be well-prepared.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
12/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 72920 63289: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
13/10/23, 1:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good day, Parents and Pride,

I hope this message finds you well. I was expecting to receive a reply from you, but it seems that you haven't had the chance to respond. Is there a particular reason that has been causing a delay in your response?

16/10/23, 3:43 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to know that. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I have no queries so far, am following along
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/10/23, 3:46 pm - +91 72920 63289: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
16/10/23, 3:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
16/10/23, 3:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well that's great

16/10/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am following along
16/10/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes yes true
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that, I am looking forward to meeting her, and with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
16/10/23, 3:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
16/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I have viewed the documents
16/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am a bit lost on  the benefits of endowment on item 2  where it says lock in post scholarship and item 3 on the grant part of it
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is alright please, as we discuss the benefits in detail you shall have a better picture, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
16/10/23, 4:06 pm - +91 72920 63289: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the student's A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - +91 72920 63289: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Pride, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
16/10/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well understood now clear
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
16/10/23, 4:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Well explained thank you
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
16/10/23, 4:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
16/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes understood
16/10/23, 4:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
16/10/23, 4:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
16/10/23, 4:23 pm - +91 72920 63289: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 30, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 30, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
16/10/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 243 1666: This one is clear, l understood
16/10/23, 4:27 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to know that. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
16/10/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 243 1666: May you please share  this one me please
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
16/10/23, 4:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
16/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I have a question, what about if a student attains more academic points a A level ,does scholarship change upward or it remains 50%
16/10/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I mean if she gets 15 points
16/10/23, 4:42 pm - +91 72920 63289: Waiting for this message
16/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Understood thanks for the clarity
16/10/23, 4:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to know that. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
16/10/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes
16/10/23, 4:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very clear
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +91 72920 63289: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
16/10/23, 4:52 pm - +91 72920 63289: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
16/10/23, 4:54 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes it's clear
16/10/23, 4:55 pm - +91 72920 63289: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
16/10/23, 4:55 pm - +91 72920 63289: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
16/10/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very clear
16/10/23, 4:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
16/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes it's clear, l have a family member here who is asking-  on the last part of giving up and getting benefits, he is asking if you can remain  an Edoofian and continue doing EWYL program  here in Zimbabwe
16/10/23, 5:11 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for your inquiry. If you decide not to pursue your education, we will remain in contact with you for a year through the EWYL program. However, if you continue to postpone your studies after that period, it may not be feasible for us to maintain ongoing communication. Though we can connect once in a while. We have other students to assist and processes to initiate, as well. If you decide to start with your higher education again, we can always resume your journey to becoming an Edoofian.
16/10/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you so much
16/10/23, 5:13 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes am now well informed
16/10/23, 5:15 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. As Pride's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Pride is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
16/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Very very much,
16/10/23, 5:19 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate their application* after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
16/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you so much , today l had a wonderful session
16/10/23, 5:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. Likewise, have a great day ahead.
02/11/23, 10:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good evening Parents and Pride,

I trust this message finds you all in the best of health and with a positive outlook. I am delighted to have the opportunity to connect with you again, and I am eager to convey a significant update to you.

Following our previous conversation, our admissions team has been diligently engaged in the thorough evaluation of your scholarship application for Indian universities, specifically under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to announce that your application has been successfully reviewed and accepted by one of the prestigious institutions, *Quest University* in India. Furthermore, they have chosen to extend a scholarship offer to you.
02/11/23, 10:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 08:00 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.

02/11/23, 10:47 pm - +91 72920 63289: <Media omitted>
03/11/23, 12:22 pm - +91 72920 63289: Good afternoon Parents and Pride.

I hope you are doing well. I am happy to hear that you were able to go through the message above. You are most welcome. In that case, let us plan to reconnect in the evening at 08:00 PM. We are eagerly looking forward to our discussion. 

We will go over the offer letter in detail and offer guidance on the next steps necessary to complete your university admission formalities. For now, we will bring our conversation to a close. I wish you a blessed day ahead, and please convey our regards to your family as well.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - +91 72920 63289: Greetings to you again

In light of the offer letter you received, I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to you and your family on this remarkable achievement in your academic journey.

Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion for you and your family, and I can only imagine the excitement that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.
03/11/23, 7:59 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
03/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am well thanks and    I am ready for the discussion. Yes I did go through the letter
03/11/23, 8:14 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. To ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin our discussion
03/11/23, 8:15 pm - +91 72920 63289: 1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
03/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 243 1666: 1. Annual tuition is $1200
2.$750-00 would opt for the cheapest
3.yes $750 will be part of the total fees am expected to pay
03/11/23, 8:32 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, please, as you can see in your offer letter from the Quest Group of Institutions, after the scholarship your per annum tuition fee is $1200.

Along with this, there is a $100 fee covering the university's regular examination fee, your uniform fee, library fee, and ERP Fee, along with other basic expenses such as the Wi-Fi facility. When you add this $100 to the per annum tuition fee of $1200, the total comes out to be $1300.
03/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  am following
03/11/23, 8:34 pm - +91 72920 63289: Let me also brief you on the accommodation as well:  The on-campus accommodations at the Quest campus have different categories and the pricing for every room is different as mentioned in your offer letter.
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - +91 72920 63289: However, all the international students prefer to stay off-campus as it is a lot cheaper and they get more freedom. We would advise the same for you. The university officials will help you find off-campus accommodations and help you settle in after you report to the campus.
03/11/23, 8:35 pm - +91 72920 63289: If you opt for accommodation outside the Campus, it would be comparatively cheaper, the cost will be around $500 per anum and that would include your food cost as well which means you would have to pay only $30 to $40 per month towards your living expenses making your per annum educational cost $1300  + $500 = $1800. I hope you are clear about this?
03/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you for the enlightenment on outside campus accomodations. True is relatively cheaper
03/11/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Am clear on that
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable. 

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.
03/11/23, 8:44 pm - +91 72920 63289: In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
03/11/23, 8:46 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes am clear
03/11/23, 8:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum fee of $1800 (with the off-campus accommodation) and so the balance fee becomes $1800 - $1000 = $800 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.
03/11/23, 8:58 pm - +91 72920 63289: With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
03/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes I can see of which $800 is very much affordable
03/11/23, 9:15 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, please. it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 16th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  it is clear
03/11/23, 9:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a *$150 grant* applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
03/11/23, 9:19 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Yes may you please explain
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - +91 72920 63289: Surely. Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 16th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 16th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
03/11/23, 9:21 pm - +91 72920 63289: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 16th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
03/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Absolutely clear
03/11/23, 9:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
03/11/23, 9:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
03/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 243 1666: No l stay in Bulawayo which is another city in Zimbabwe
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Truely l need assistance in that regard - method of payment
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +91 72920 63289: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
03/11/23, 9:35 pm - +91 72920 63289: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
03/11/23, 9:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
03/11/23, 9:38 pm - +263 77 243 1666: I have served his number and will contact him
03/11/23, 9:45 pm - +91 72920 63289: That is good to know. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
03/11/23, 9:45 pm - +91 72920 63289: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charle's FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
03/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 243 1666: May you just give me, so that I will be certain
03/11/23, 9:50 pm - +91 72920 63289: Surely. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Charle’s is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
03/11/23, 9:52 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Noted with thanks surely this the best to minimize traveling with cash
03/11/23, 9:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
03/11/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Not related to the enrollment, may t kindly highlight to on the amount for visa and traveling expenses, one of my family member is asking ,so that we are very clear of our budget
03/11/23, 10:17 pm - +91 72920 63289: Surely let me help you with that. The average cost of a flight ticket from Zimbabwe to India will be between $400 to $500 and will have to be paid by the student itself and the vis fee will be $83
03/11/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you for that information we may go ahead
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. In that case, let me also tell you a bit about the Quest Group of institutions. It is the most ideal destination for international students interested in studying in India. They have more than 200 International students from more than 15 different countries in Africa and Southeast Asia.
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - +91 72920 63289: It has a Unique Mentorship program to encourage students to do well according to their abilities and strengths and has been awarded Outstanding Technical Institution of North India during the World Education Summit and Awards.
03/11/23, 10:22 pm - +91 72920 63289: Quest Group of Institutions is approved by the All India Council of Technical Education (AICTE), the statutory body for Technical Education under the Ministry of HRD, Govt. of India. It is affiliated with IKG Punjab Technical University, which is a Govt. University ranked amongst the top public universities in India.

03/11/23, 10:31 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, please. Now, I would also encourage you to take some time and share your offer letter with your family, have a detailed discussion with them, and help them understand the letter better. 

I am sure they must be quite excited for you since you have been offered a scholarship by an Indian university and now you are one step closer to making your dream of education abroad a reality.

During your conversation, if you come up with any queries or any concerns, I would encourage you to note them down so that we can have a detailed discussion on them by tomorrow morning and also discuss the way forward for Pride's admission process
03/11/23, 10:34 pm - +263 77 243 1666: True , l  need to share and discuss with family   about this wonderful opportunity
03/11/23, 10:36 pm - +91 72920 63289: Yes, please have a great night ahead and once again I would like to Congratulate you on your accomplishment⭐.
03/11/23, 10:55 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you thank you same to you
03/11/23, 10:57 pm - +91 72920 63289: You are most welcome. I would like to inform you that our discussion tomorrow is scheduled for 08:30 a.m. I hope you will be available.
03/11/23, 11:13 pm - +263 77 243 1666: Hoping so also
04/11/23, 8:29 am - +91 72920 63289: Good Morning Parents and Pride!

I hope you are doing well and I find you in high spirits. After our previous discussion, I am sure you and your family were filled with anticipation regarding the opportunity presented by Quest University. 

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from QuestUniversity as a collective?
04/11/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 243 1666: Good morning,  yes we they were exited about the offer letter  but unfortunately we did not discuss much about it.
04/11/23, 8:40 am - +91 72920 63289: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
04/11/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 243 1666: Some had a mixed feeling that, the student herself should follow  these conversations we are making religiously before we move a step forward so she can appreciate the opportunity given to her
04/11/23, 9:24 am - +91 72920 63289: It's completely understandable what you have mentioned. Involving the student in these conversations can indeed be beneficial. It allows her to stay informed and engaged with the process. However, please do not worry. 

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
04/11/23, 9:27 am - +91 72920 63289: As of now, her application has been only accepted by the Quest Group of Institutes and since we have shared her application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. Here she is not missing anything, when she is back she will be able to take part in the other discussions when we get an update we will notify you.

I hope you are clear about this now?
04/11/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes cleared
04/11/23, 9:32 am - +91 72920 63289: I am glad to hear that. As you know each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Quest, you would lose out on the scholarship from Quest and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
04/11/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 243 1666: I was not aware but l think somehow during the counseling section  l learnt that student is allowed to change the program / course if she feels the is better opportunity
04/11/23, 9:52 am - +91 72920 63289: @263772431666 what you are referring to here is regarding the change of course, however, I am referring to a transfer option. Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Quest by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Quest without risking losing out on the scholarship.
04/11/23, 9:54 am - +91 72920 63289: By this, you will be reserving Pride's seat with the university and Pride will have the option to be included in the discussions in the future as well, and as you said above she should be here since the opportunity is given to her, she would have that opportunity as well without losing the seat.

May I know if you are clear?
04/11/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes well understood
04/11/23, 10:00 am - +91 72920 63289: Amazing. Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?
04/11/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes  a further question  so that l am well prepared on the budget . Apart from enrollment fee, tution, accomodation and food,visa and flight any other additional cash needed
04/11/23, 10:14 am - +91 72920 63289: No, please there are no additional costs that you are required to pay, right now your main focus is to reserve Pride's seat with the university, the remaining tuition fee can be paid once Pride arrives in India.
04/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 243 1666: Thank you it's clear we may go ahead, l will reserve the  seat
04/11/23, 10:18 am - +91 72920 63289: That's great to hear. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
04/11/23, 10:18 am - +263 77 243 1666: By paying enrollment fees which
04/11/23, 10:19 am - +91 72920 63289: I believe by enrollment you mean registration fee, right?
04/11/23, 10:20 am - +263 77 243 1666: Yes please that's correct
04/11/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 243 1666: Not yet ,l intended to do that tonight that is when l usual get time and better network.
04/11/23, 10:35 am - +91 72920 63289: That is alright, please you can certainly take your time and research about the university. As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
