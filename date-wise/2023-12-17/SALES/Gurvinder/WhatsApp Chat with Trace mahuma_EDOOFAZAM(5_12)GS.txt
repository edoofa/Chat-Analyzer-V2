05/12/23, 7:51 am - Gurvinder: Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
05/12/23, 8:14 am - +260 97 6752200: What I understand from Edoofa scholarship program is that this is the program that was created to offer students scholarships in other countries and Zambia is one of them far from that Edoofa India provides Education for everyone student who is eligible and also can employ students. 
It helps students in leadership and development also responsible in utilizing the education infrastructure landscape those are some of the things I understand from the program thank you
05/12/23, 8:17 am - +260 97 9973611: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 8:45 am - Gurvinder: That is correct.
05/12/23, 8:46 am - Gurvinder: Let me also brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 8:46 am - +260 97 6752200: Alright sir am willing to hear all what’s about
05/12/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 6752200: I came to learn about edoofa at my school, from one of my teachers and I took keen interest in researching about it. And the turnout and reviews were stunning. 
I learnt that:

Edoofa is an international educational platform that connects students with scholarships for higher education. It aims to make quality education accessible to students globally, providing them with opportunities to pursue undergraduate and postgraduate studies. Edoofa utilizes a personalized approach, incorporating mentorship and career guidance to support students throughout their academic journey, and not only that, I but it's also help you get employment because of the huge chances you get of getting educated through them. And I applied and prayed I was given a short. 
Thank you.
05/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 8:48 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 8:49 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 8:57 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes you are right am actually desperately looking forward to this scholarship so as I can help my vulnerable family and achieve my goals and dreams
05/12/23, 8:58 am - +260 97 6752200: Am also asking, how do you pick when it comes to results from the final exam
05/12/23, 9:00 am - +260 97 6752200: It’s really a beautiful place
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Trace, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 9:15 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 9:22 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir and I promise to do my very best, by being active in all counseling sessions till the day we will finish sir thank you
05/12/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 9973611: Hello sir, as a mother am very interested and happy with the EDOOFA Scholarship program bcos if my girl is choose,   it will mean the whole family is going to benefit. May God bless you for coming up with the EDOOFA Scholarship program 🙏🙏
05/12/23, 9:39 am - Gurvinder: That is great.

05/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: *“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”* I hope that you achieve your dream and ignore those who laugh at you.

05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 2:39 pm - Gurvinder: Trace, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
05/12/23, 2:40 pm - Gurvinder: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like:
1. *Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Bio technology*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
05/12/23, 2:51 pm - +260 97 6752200: I know about India being the best country in terms of health and things to do with medicine, alright then I can venture into Bachelors of science in physiotherapy it won’t really matter since I will still be doing a study under the healthcare sector <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - +260 97 6752200: Since it requires sciences and Biology and am a bit good in those subjects you can refer to my term two science results they were the highest among all the subjects I took thank you <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
05/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
05/12/23, 3:10 pm - +260 97 9973611: Yes you may please
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Students enrolled to the course are taught on an advanced level about core physiotherapeutic skills such as manual therapy, therapeutic exercises, and application of electro-physical modalities, which have been proven to cure a range of disabilities and disease related to spine, back, neck, and even stress-related incontinence.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: Bachelor of Physiotherapy is a 4-year undergraduate course, including compulsory 6 months of clinical internship, and involving the science of physical movement aimed at preventing disease and disability.
05/12/23, 3:17 pm - Gurvinder: The opportunities for a career in Physiotherapy are excellent, whether in the public health system, private practice or non-government organisations. Career pathways include the disciplines and areas of:

*Healthcare Management*
*Industrial Rehabilitation*
*Research & Academics*
*Special Schools*
*Multinational companies for fitness of their employers*
05/12/23, 3:27 pm - +260 97 9973611: Thank you very much for the information of the course
05/12/23, 3:30 pm - +260 97 9973611: Can one become a specialised doctor in Physiotherapy
05/12/23, 3:32 pm - +260 97 9973611: Which one does physio require between sciences and biology or physics and mathematics
05/12/23, 3:41 pm - Gurvinder: You require Physics, Chemistry and Maths.
05/12/23, 3:59 pm - +260 97 9973611: Ok noted thanks 🙏
05/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 6752200: Alright

06/12/23, 8:15 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
06/12/23, 8:34 am - +260 97 6752200: Morning
06/12/23, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
06/12/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 9:10 am - +260 97 6752200: So to be specific what’s the range of points are needed for one to achieve the scholarship
06/12/23, 9:10 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes am confident I will do it by Gods grace
06/12/23, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: It is 4 points, Trace.
06/12/23, 9:17 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
06/12/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 6752200: Am not understanding by 4 points please I think I need more clarity on that
06/12/23, 9:27 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes I understood it very much
06/12/23, 9:34 am - Gurvinder: Basically you need to pass minimum 2 subjects, but I would suggest that you pass all of them.
06/12/23, 9:36 am - +260 97 6752200: I now understand okay then my prayer will be to pass all of them
06/12/23, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/12/23, 9:45 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
06/12/23, 10:49 am - +260 97 6752200: In the next five years and + I see myself doing something interesting and aspiring . Physiotherapy is a course that requires one to have interest and not just do it for the sake because it involves a lot of exercise, massage etc so as I will be doing the course I will learn to do things by heart. 
Beside, it will give me chances to help others with disabilities and reach out to others who don’t know the importance of exercise.
In the years to come if am picked for the scholarship I promise to do all my level best in participating in all activities that are required by the University. Doing my studies at EDOOFA can build me and change my life for the better I can see myself changing people life by achieving the impossible because I will be the first one to study abroad in my family and as a girl for that matter. 
Not only for that reason but doing that course as girl in my family I will be the first one what a great achievement will it be. Sir picking me for the scholarship at your University won’t only put your University on the world maps but will change a lot of females lives in Zambia especially. 🙏 <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 10:51 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Trace, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/12/23, 10:53 am - +260 97 6752200: Yes am more than ready Mr Gurvinder
06/12/23, 10:55 am - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 11:01 am - +260 97 6752200: Because in my country there less chances of getting a job due to tough competition but in a case that one studied from another country they are considered more experienced and advanced in the career field apart from that studying abroad gives me  an advantage because I feel the information that side is broad than the information given to us in my country to add on I have always wished to study abroad and fly in the air for it will be my first time being on an airplane
06/12/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 11:57 am - +260 97 6752200: The way I can contribute to my country is that when I start doing my job I will teach others students on new skills that I will learn from that side and if possible as time goes by I can even open my own clinic also encourage pupils to work harder at school and attain such knowledge
06/12/23, 12:04 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Trace, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 12:11 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes I do agree for it’s still possible for me to study abroad because I won’t be the only one from Zambia isn’t it which makes the environment more conducive for my studies <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 12:17 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes am wondering why and how come
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/12/23, 12:27 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

06/12/23, 12:40 pm - +260 97 6752200: Wow it felt like am now studying indias history
06/12/23, 12:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now Trace, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
06/12/23, 12:44 pm - +260 97 6752200: So now on number six there is cultural aspect so is it that you follow the culture of dress code or student are allowed to wear what they feel like
06/12/23, 12:46 pm - +260 97 6752200: And I have seen the quality of Education offered it’s so advanced and interesting at the same time
06/12/23, 12:47 pm - +260 97 6752200: I really want to be there any time soon
06/12/23, 12:48 pm - Gurvinder: That depends on the University.
06/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 6752200: Okay
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 97 6752200: No not at all
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
06/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
06/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/12/23, 2:14 pm - +260 97 6752200: India is way better than the other countries sir so if one qualifies by undergoing various test the fees are reduced it’s just the best
06/12/23, 2:17 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Trace what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 3:37 pm - +260 97 6752200: Understood better then what of holidays how are they?
06/12/23, 3:38 pm - +260 97 6752200: This message was deleted
06/12/23, 3:42 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
06/12/23, 4:10 pm - +260 97 9973611: Yes you can go ahead ,brief me.
06/12/23, 4:11 pm - +260 97 9973611: I mean you can brief us
06/12/23, 7:04 pm - +260 97 9973611: Mr Gurvinder we were waiting for the briefing about the Earn while learning the program
07/12/23, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the best of which you are capable.”

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
07/12/23, 9:42 am - +260 97 6752200: Morning indeed it’s a beautiful day let’s get started and may God be with you
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
07/12/23, 9:53 am - Gurvinder: Trace, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/12/23, 10:23 am - +260 97 6752200: I understand that while Iam learning and doing my college program, I'll be handed tasks and projects about the 21st century involvement such as blog creation content creation and digital marketing that Iam obliged to complete in order to earn some scholarship credits which are then converted to physical cash that can only be used to help pay up tuition fees, as the scholarship states. This is not really a great deal for me because I already have a prior understanding of content creation as I helped my brother creat content for his YouTube channel for about a year so I at least already have a bit of understanding in content creation and the likes.

I'll be more than happy to ace the tasks. 
Thank you.
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
07/12/23, 10:26 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

07/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
07/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
07/12/23, 10:37 am - +260 97 6752200: It will befit me in all aspects more especially on base of projects with Brand and company under the Global Radio it’s really interesting
07/12/23, 12:10 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Trace, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
07/12/23, 12:46 pm - +260 97 6752200: So in short Earn as you learn helps one reduce one’s cost on fees according to their performance in the real time work <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 12:55 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
07/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

07/12/23, 12:59 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
07/12/23, 1:28 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 1:30 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir we are
07/12/23, 1:31 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes you are really different but I still want to do the Earn as you learn
07/12/23, 1:33 pm - +260 97 6752200: And I have noticed that the last award was different why is it so?

07/12/23, 1:55 pm - +260 97 6752200: So those are the new types of certificates
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
07/12/23, 2:02 pm - Gurvinder: Trace, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
07/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes I now understand but I have a question as well <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 2:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Trace, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
07/12/23, 2:20 pm - +260 97 6752200: What do you mean by that
07/12/23, 2:21 pm - +260 97 6752200: You mean the scholarship won’t be given to me even if I pass my exam
07/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Yes it will be Trace, the reduced fees too can be a less of a burden to your parents through the earn while you learn program, but for the remaining, will you parents support you for this?
07/12/23, 2:32 pm - +260 97 6752200: I thought the Earn as you learn is just there to help one reduce their costs of fees whilst  the scholarship is still helping me
07/12/23, 2:33 pm - +260 97 6752200: Because my mother can only manage the expenses such as food and self sustainability <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: No one is saying that you cannot earn your whole fees, I am just saying in the case where you cannot, will your family members support you?
07/12/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 6752200: Okay then it’s me who misunderstood the whole point
07/12/23, 4:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
07/12/23, 4:08 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes I have
07/12/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: And are they willing to support in such situation?
07/12/23, 4:12 pm - +260 97 6752200: More than willing sir
07/12/23, 4:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 4:15 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir
07/12/23, 4:16 pm - Gurvinder: Trace as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 4:28 pm - +260 97 6752200: It’s still okay I think
07/12/23, 4:29 pm - Gurvinder: Please tell me the exact figure, Trace.
07/12/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 6752200: $250-$400 I think to be specific
07/12/23, 4:31 pm - +260 97 6752200: What of Edoofa how much does one need to spend on the application form
07/12/23, 4:36 pm - Gurvinder: Trace if the cost of applying to one University is $300 -$450, then how can applying to 5 can be $250-$400?
07/12/23, 4:37 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of applying to 5 Universities will be $1500-$2250, Trace.
07/12/23, 4:37 pm - Gurvinder: Isn't that very high?
07/12/23, 4:37 pm - +260 97 6752200: Ohh I didn’t realize it
07/12/23, 4:38 pm - +260 97 6752200: It is but we can be left with no option
07/12/23, 4:39 pm - +260 97 6752200: Am I allowed to send a voice note because I want to explain myself better
07/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: As this is an official conversation for which I have to keep a record, I cannot allow that. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 4:41 pm - +260 97 6752200: Okay sir
07/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I continue?
07/12/23, 4:42 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes you may go ahead
07/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: Trace, as you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
07/12/23, 4:43 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 4:46 pm - +260 97 6752200: Then Edoofa application fees are fair
07/12/23, 4:47 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
07/12/23, 4:50 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
07/12/23, 4:52 pm - +260 97 6752200: I do but will Edoofa consider all applications made by students in that case
07/12/23, 4:54 pm - Gurvinder: Trace, our experts will always be there for you, they will prepare a suitable application displaying your positive traits, your passion and then submit it to the universities.
07/12/23, 4:56 pm - +260 97 6752200: I pray so I really want to be enrolled into your University
07/12/23, 4:57 pm - Gurvinder: Yes hope for the best.
07/12/23, 4:57 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
07/12/23, 4:58 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.
07/12/23, 4:58 pm - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
07/12/23, 5:04 pm - +260 97 6752200: In phase 1 , this means one has to pay before starting their Earn as you learn program
07/12/23, 5:06 pm - +260 97 6752200: Then phase 2 one can start their Earn as you learn program even before the results are out
07/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 97 6752200: The last passage, how do you know that one is eligible for the scholarship for you to grant them adequate time for paying their fees
07/12/23, 5:13 pm - Gurvinder: That will be tested from this counselling session, the tests, and the interview,
07/12/23, 5:14 pm - +260 97 6752200: Alright sir
07/12/23, 5:15 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
07/12/23, 5:16 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes I’m
07/12/23, 5:17 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 5:17 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Trace, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself. <This message was edited>
07/12/23, 5:18 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
07/12/23, 5:22 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes I do sir but I just hope I proceed to step 2 sir
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: Great.
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
07/12/23, 5:23 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
07/12/23, 5:31 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
07/12/23, 5:32 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir
07/12/23, 5:33 pm - Gurvinder: So everything clear?
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - +260 97 6752200: Yes sir except transport
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - +260 97 6752200: How are transport payments done
07/12/23, 5:34 pm - Gurvinder: You will be guided for that, Trace.
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - Gurvinder: Anything else?
07/12/23, 5:35 pm - +260 97 6752200: Alright
07/12/23, 5:36 pm - +260 97 6752200: So I will have to wait to be told that I have been chosen for the second step
07/12/23, 5:39 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that will be decided after the eligibility check evaluation.
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - +260 97 6752200: Okay
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
07/12/23, 5:40 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

14/12/23, 11:16 am - Gurvinder: Trace, on average a student takes one and a half hours to attempt this test but you have been on the test for almost 2 days now, I understand that you might have had issues, but did you communicate them with me?
14/12/23, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: Because if you would not communicate, I am not a God who would understand what is going on in your mind without you even sharing it with me.

14/12/23, 8:05 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.

16/12/23, 8:39 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Dear, I hope you are doing well

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.
