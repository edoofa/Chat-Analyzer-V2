12/12/23, 8:07 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Emmanuel, Mr and Mrs Nayoya!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
12/12/23, 10:44 am - +260 96 7154080: Good Morning Sir
12/12/23, 11:05 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Emmanuel,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
12/12/23, 11:08 am - +260 96 7154080: Ok, thank you.
12/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Emmanuel, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Mphatso, is that correct?
12/12/23, 12:47 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes
12/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Mphatso, also do tell me whether you learnt about Mphatso’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
12/12/23, 1:38 pm - +260 96 7154080: Mphatso told me that the Edoofa Program enables  one to secure their desired course of study with reason being that Universities aren't overcrowded due to selection by the program and is better on a financial standing compared to most private and public universities within Zambia with adding to the fact that certain skills maybe used to earn  and pay for one's self and in his case he told me Network Marketing. <This message was edited>
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
12/12/23, 1:53 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:54 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
12/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes sir, that is true .
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Emmanuel, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
12/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
12/12/23, 2:32 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes, I have what it takes.
12/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Now Emmanuel, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?

7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Grade 12?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

*“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
14/12/23, 10:01 am - +260 96 7154080: Ok

14/12/23, 10:39 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Emmanuel, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
14/12/23, 10:40 am - +260 96 7154080: Yes I do
14/12/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
14/12/23, 10:41 am - +260 96 7154080: Yes I do and I would like to know why that is.
14/12/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
14/12/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

14/12/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: So now Emmanuel, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
14/12/23, 11:13 am - +260 96 7154080: I currently have no questions.
14/12/23, 11:24 am - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
14/12/23, 11:26 am - +260 96 7154080: Not at all.
14/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
14/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
14/12/23, 12:12 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

14/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

14/12/23, 12:18 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Emmanuel what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
14/12/23, 12:19 pm - +260 96 7154080: What will cost come to if I undergo the Earn While You Learn Program?
14/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Let me first explain the Earn While You Learn program.
14/12/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Emmanuel, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
14/12/23, 12:53 pm - +260 96 7154080: Ok noted.
14/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
14/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

14/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
14/12/23, 1:59 pm - +260 96 7154080: This message was deleted
14/12/23, 2:03 pm - +260 96 7154080: I view this to be greatly advantageous. It makes it in such a way that I will not completely depend on my sponsors who may encounter challenges paying for my education and finances.
14/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Emmanuel, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
14/12/23, 2:06 pm - +260 96 7154080: Amazing. So it may be possible to completely pay for myself?
14/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

14/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
14/12/23, 2:15 pm - +260 96 7154080: This is truly a dream come true.
14/12/23, 2:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Emmanuel, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
14/12/23, 2:16 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes that is true.
14/12/23, 2:24 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
14/12/23, 2:25 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes I have and they are in full support of me doing my education from outside the country.
14/12/23, 2:26 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
14/12/23, 2:26 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes I am absolutely ready
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Gurvinder: Emmanuel as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - +260 96 7154080: Between $1500-$2250
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Emmanuel, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
14/12/23, 2:28 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:29 pm - +260 96 7154080: Ok
14/12/23, 2:30 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes I do.
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
14/12/23, 2:31 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee, before their Grade 12 result is out).


Phase 3: Once the final grade 12 results are out, if the student would have passed the necessary requirement (of 4 Grade 12 passes.) then start with their University Interaction. If the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.


The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.

However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
14/12/23, 2:34 pm - +260 96 7154080: Ok noted
14/12/23, 2:35 pm - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
14/12/23, 2:36 pm - +260 96 7154080: No I am not familiar with the Edoofa cycle
14/12/23, 2:36 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Emmanuel, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zambia itself.
14/12/23, 2:37 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
14/12/23, 2:38 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes I do understand.
14/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of the registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
14/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August/September 2024 and the remaining in January next year 2025.
14/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
14/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: So now would you like to ask anything?
14/12/23, 2:43 pm - +260 96 7154080: Not at all.
14/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
14/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
14/12/23, 2:43 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

I believe you must have gone through the entire counselling session once again with your family members.

Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?
15/12/23, 12:02 pm - +260 96 7154080: Yes
15/12/23, 12:11 pm - +260 96 6830370: Yes Sir

15/12/23, 1:07 pm - +260 96 6439015: So far not so many questions,just want to ask if there is any adjustments that could be made regarding the application form
15/12/23, 1:09 pm - +260 96 6439015: In terms of time frame to make the initial or full payment
15/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: May I know what is the issue?
15/12/23, 1:56 pm - +260 96 6439015: The $200 which I should be paid soon and balance before month-end. I'm trying to mobilize funds at the same time requesting for time adjustment, e.g initial payment to be made by 3rd January and balance by 15th January.
15/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Mr Nayoya, as a senior counsellor it is my job to assist you in planning your finances for Emmanuel's higher education, but before that, I hope you are aware of the cost of education after the scholarship and also about the 7-day enrollment fee payment deadline.
15/12/23, 2:10 pm - +260 96 6439015: Yes, I'm aware and it's the reason I was asking for at least 15-day enrollment fee payment deadline starting from today.
15/12/23, 2:19 pm - +260 96 6439015: I think the question I'm asking is in stage 5, so for now I would say no question and waiting for your guidance to the other stages
15/12/23, 2:24 pm - +260 96 6830370: No questions so far Mr Gurvinder.
15/12/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 7154080: No questions so far.
15/12/23, 3:10 pm - Gurvinder: So @260966439015 , before we move to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me

1. What is the name of the course that @260967154080 would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will your child be studying through the Edoofa program?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
15/12/23, 3:28 pm - +260 96 6439015: He wants to do Computer engineering through the Edoofa program.
2.He will be studying from India
3.The average cost of studying from India without schoolar is 2500 3000 USD
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - +260 96 6439015: The average cost of studying in India is about 8000USD without scholarship and about 2500 to 3000USD with scholarship
4.The annual fee I will pay if found eligible is about 2500USD
5.The enrollment fee is 350USD 
6. In my own understanding,it's like working while studying and what you earn is not paid to me directly but deducted from my tuition fees.
7. Question 7 is very clear
15/12/23, 3:49 pm - Gurvinder: Please answer the 5th question properly.
15/12/23, 3:53 pm - +260 96 6439015: 5.350USD to be paid within 7days after admission letter is given if payment is made in full
16/12/23, 8:51 am - Gurvinder: *@260966439015*,  I am happy to see that you understand the program details so well. I totally understand that you have work to do and So I really appreciate your cooperation and the time you are taking out to support your child.
16/12/23, 8:51 am - Gurvinder: Please note that the number of scholarship seats is limited in number, and in case *Emmanuel* is selected for the scholarship we expect that you are clear and aware of all the details shared during the session along with that you also obey the rules and honour the scholarship terms.
16/12/23, 8:52 am - Gurvinder: In case you do not follow these terms then *Emmanuel’s* entire scholarship process will go into backlog and you will only be able to apply for the scholarship after 6 months. By then the entire fee structure for the scholarship program may increase*.
16/12/23, 9:18 am - +260 96 6439015: I have understood
16/12/23, 10:49 am - Gurvinder: Ideally, as you know, the tentative dates are:
