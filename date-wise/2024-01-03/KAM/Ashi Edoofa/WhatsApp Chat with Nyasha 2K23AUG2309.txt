20/12/23, 1:37 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
