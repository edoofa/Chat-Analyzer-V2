20/12/23, 1:38 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 2:26 PM - +260 96 8651816: It's been a pleasure having you as my administrator, thank you sir.
20/12/23, 3:43 PM - +260 97 7408010: Thank you Mr. Shivjeet for your counsel and guidance. All the best in your new endeavours.

Mrs. Bella Mwale 
(Ryan's mother.)
27/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

In light of the conversation we had earlier, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you are ready for the discussion today. With this said, May I know if you are available for the conversation ?

I am eagerly waiting for your response.
27/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 96 8651816: @919650537098 I'm available
27/12/23, 3:29 PM - +260 97 7408010: Am also here, though my husband is working and being manager IT it's hard for him, unless in the evening after 21:00hrs.
27/12/23, 3:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that you are ready for the session today, Before we start our session, May I kindly if you have gone through the videos shared by Mr. Shivjeet?
27/12/23, 3:30 PM - +260 97 7408010: This is Ryan's mother 🙏🏾
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes I did
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to meet @260977408010
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
27/12/23, 3:31 PM - +260 97 7408010: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: Okay so I learned from this video edoofa gives the opportunity for students to live independently on the scholarship credits which are earned by the individual and lastly we must be open minded and willing to learn.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: On this one I learned edoofa not only to get a pupil admitted into a school but to also to find employment, we must also follow all protocols advised by the admission officers.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: From this video I learned we must be prompt at all times to ensure during the time when I'm interacting with the university or college I must be fit enough to handle. And my attitude, skill and my knowledge also matters throughout my education journey.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - +260 96 8651816: I learned that the statement of purpose is the most critical stage for it is where I will be required to Express my wild endeavors to why I would like to be enrolled into their respected universities or colleges
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @260968651816, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
27/12/23, 4:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
27/12/23, 4:10 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
27/12/23, 4:11 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am I was able to understand from the videos
27/12/23, 4:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
27/12/23, 4:14 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes we are ma'am.
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:00 PM.
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
27/12/23, 4:22 PM - +260 96 8651816: I can complete the tasks before 9:00AM tomorrow and submit.
27/12/23, 4:24 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 2:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to complete the task. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
27/12/23, 4:26 PM - +260 96 8651816: Thank you for your time madam.
27/12/23, 4:26 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @260968651816
28/12/23, 12:07 AM - +260 96 8651816: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q2. Thermodynamics is the study of the effects of work, heavy, and energy on a system. It is only concerned with macroscopic change and observations such as change in temperature. Thermodynamics is in general terms concerned with the transition of energy from one position to another and from one form to another. 
There are three laws of thermodynamics known to man which are as follows the first law states when energy moves in or out of the system. The systems internal energy changes in accordance with the law of conservation of mass in simpler terms energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be converted from one form to another for example kinetic engery - the energy that an object possesses when it moves it is converted to heat energy when a driver presses the brakes on the car to slow it down.
The second law states there exists a useful state variable called entropy. The change in entropy is equal th the heat transfer divided by the temperature. An example when we put an ice cube in a cup with water at room temperature. The water at room temperature releases off heat and the ice cube melts, hence the entropy of water drops.
The third law states the entropy of a system approaches a constant value as temperature approaches zero for example vapour of water at high temperatures as the molecules within steam are randomly moving this it will have a high entropy.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q3. A valve is a device or natural object that regulates, directs or controls the flow of a fluid by opening, closing or partially obstructing various passageways. 
A butterfly valve is a type of a valve which is used to shut the flow of fluid. It is often said that butterfly valves can be used to regulate the flow of fluid, however it is not recommended using it as it can damage the valve disk and have a negative effect on the sealing properties. The valve requires less structural support than a ball valve of comparable diameter. These valves are commonly used in pipe lines in handling large fluid flows.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q4. Heat treating is a group of industrial thermal and metal working processes used to alter the physical and sometimes chemical properties of the material. It can also be defined as the heating or chilling normally to extreme temperatures to achieve the desired result such as hardening or softening of a material. It is done to improve the mechanical properties of a material that include hardness, tensile, strength, shock, resistance, ductility and resistance to corrosion to improve mechinability and reduce brittleness and make the versatile.
Heat treatment are also used in the manufacture of many other materials such as glass. Although the term heat treatment applies only to processes where the heating and cooling are done for specific of altering properties intentionally, heating and cooling often occur incidentally during other manufacturing such as hot forming or welding.
28/12/23, 9:04 AM - +260 96 8651816: Q5. A compressor can be defined as an instrument or device used to compress something or a machine used to supply air or other gas at increased pressure for example to a gas turbine.
There are thirteen types of compressors created by man namely centrifugal compressor, rotary - screw compressor, scroll compressors, axial compressor, rotary vane compressor, compressor, dynamic compressor, rotary screw compressor, reciprocating compressor, piston compressor, classification of air compressor and oil free compressor.
Centrifugal compressor is used to power gas turbines engines used in jet aircrafts. It is used because turbines are used due to higher rotating speeds and the centrifugal compressor are used in pipeline booster services where high volume and low compression ratios exist.

28/12/23, 2:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan, I hope you are doing well. 

Thank you for sharing your response regarding the SOP form and academic questions.  With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey. May I know if you are ready for today's session?
28/12/23, 2:01 PM - +260 96 8651816: Afternoon ma'am, I'm ready for today's session.
28/12/23, 2:09 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @260968651816, Before we start our today's session, May I know if you are connected with your mentor?
28/12/23, 2:31 PM - +260 96 8651816: At the time being I do not have a mentor ma'am.
28/12/23, 2:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you have filled the EWYL form?
28/12/23, 2:40 PM - +260 96 8651816: This was the form I filled ma'am I'm not sure if this is the one you speak of?
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, Let me share the ewyl form with you so that you can fill the same.
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 2:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the form, you will find a section where you are required to specify the date on which you intend to commence your EWYL journey. The next batch is scheduled to start on *Friday (05th January 2024)*. If you are enthusiastic about beginning the procedures on that particular date, please fill it in accordingly. 

However, if you are unavailable to commence your EWYL Journey on that date, please inform us, and we will propose an alternative date for the next session. Our aim is to align this with your availability to ensure a smooth transition.
28/12/23, 2:50 PM - +260 96 8651816: Let me fill the form now
28/12/23, 2:57 PM - +260 96 8651816: @919650537098 Is the form due today ma'am?
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: No dear, You can share it with tomorrow if there is any challenge
28/12/23, 3:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Shall we move forward?
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am.
28/12/23, 3:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *B.Tech (Mechanical Engineering)* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate? <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:16 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes it is.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
28/12/23, 3:18 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am, it is most certainly is not possible.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of *$500 to $750*. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
28/12/23, 3:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
28/12/23, 3:27 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes ma'am we discussed on that topic.
28/12/23, 3:31 PM - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
28/12/23, 3:32 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes we are
28/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
28/12/23, 3:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
28/12/23, 3:45 PM - +260 97 7408010: Iam also following but the father will catch up in the evening as we are the main sponsors of Ryan as his biological parents.

Thank you for the information. Let us also go thru with my husband, but Ryan is keenly following as your prospective incoming Student.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Nice to connect with you @260977408010, I indeed resonate with you.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
28/12/23, 3:48 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
28/12/23, 8:44 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @260977408010 @260968651816 As I was looking forward for your response, I would love to move ahead with the discussion, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 02:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan, Wishing you a good day!

In regards to our conversation yesterday, I would like to know if you are ready for today's discussion, I am looking forward to connect with you today. On the same note, Could you please share your response with us?
29/12/23, 2:16 PM - +260 97 7408010: Good afternoon Ms. Ashi
29/12/23, 2:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response dear, May I know if we can start our discussion for today?
29/12/23, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8651816: Good afternoon Ms Ashi
29/12/23, 2:24 PM - +260 96 8651816: Yes we can start our conversation.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're ready. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
29/12/23, 2:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
29/12/23, 2:37 PM - +260 97 7408010: Madam Ashi for my husband and I evenings are better for us because we are together and can consult. With Mr. Shivjeet that's how we did it. Please accept our plight. You can go ahead with your student
29/12/23, 2:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @260977408010. I would love to schedule our session in the evening, May I know when you  would like to schedule our today's session?
29/12/23, 3:25 PM - +260 97 7408010: At 21:00 hrs ma'am.
29/12/23, 3:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @260977408010, Let's continue with the session at 9:00pm
29/12/23, 3:42 PM - +260 97 7408010: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:55 PM - +260 97 7408010: Following...... (mother to Ryan) 🙏🏾
29/12/23, 7:02 PM - +260 96 1242533: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Ashi Edoofa: May I know if you are ready for the discussion?
29/12/23, 9:12 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes please we can
29/12/23, 9:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please. Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
29/12/23, 9:15 PM - +260 96 1242533: Please take us through...
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:21 PM - +260 96 1242533: Thats exciting. We surely look forward
29/12/23, 9:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, indeed @260961242533 .

30/12/23, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, Let me share that with great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.

30/12/23, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

30/12/23, 8:13 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
30/12/23, 8:14 PM - +260 96 1242533: ok noted
30/12/23, 8:32 PM - +260 96 1242533: Ok its clear now
30/12/23, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
30/12/23, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. *Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa*.

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
30/12/23, 8:32 PM - Ashi Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means you, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning your as a frontier person in this endeavor.
30/12/23, 9:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Dear Parents and Ryan ,

30/12/23, 9:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 9:14 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Wishing you all a Happy New Year. May it be filled with love, laughter, and endless possibilities.

2/1/24, 12:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, Let's connect at 9:00pm
2/1/24, 9:04 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Ryan,

I hope this message finds you well. In regards to my previous messages, I wanted to share that I am looking forward for our discussion today regarding your admission journey. I am here at the scheduled time and am looking forward to our conversation. Please let me know if you are available for the discussion.

I am genuinely excited and eagerly awaiting your response.
2/1/24, 9:11 PM - +260 96 1242533: Good evening
Thanks we are here and may proceed
2/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let's continue with the benefits,
2/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. *Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.* 

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 9:12 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 9:14 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes ir does
2/1/24, 9:15 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
2/1/24, 9:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750 . Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 9:18 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes
2/1/24, 9:19 PM - Ashi Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 9:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 9:20 PM - Ashi Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $650, you'll need to make a payment of $325 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $325 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 9:23 PM - +260 96 1242533: No proceed
2/1/24, 9:23 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - +260 96 1242533: Kindly shade light on the process
2/1/24, 9:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
2/1/24, 9:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
2/1/24, 9:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
2/1/24, 9:28 PM - Ashi Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement for the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
2/1/24, 9:32 PM - +260 97 7408010: Well noted.
2/1/24, 9:33 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
2/1/24, 9:36 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes, noted
2/1/24, 9:36 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
2/1/24, 9:37 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes noted
2/1/24, 9:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
2/1/24, 9:37 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
2/1/24, 9:38 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, you will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for your exams, and your scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
2/1/24, 9:38 PM - +260 96 1242533: Yes
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of your interest in August 2024 itself.
2/1/24, 9:39 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
2/1/24, 9:41 PM - +260 97 7408010: Following
2/1/24, 9:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
2/1/24, 9:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
2/1/24, 9:43 PM - +260 96 1242533: Noted
2/1/24, 9:45 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 9:46 PM - +260 96 1242533: You may proceed
2/1/24, 9:47 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Kindly share your pending document which is your 12th grade
2/1/24, 9:49 PM - +260 96 1242533: We will share his mock results. We searching as they were misplaced. Alternatively we shall get a copy from his former school
2/1/24, 9:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Noted @260961242533, as a part of your application file, you will need to visit your school and secure a letter of recommendation from them. We have attached a sample document to help guide you through the process.
2/1/24, 9:51 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Here are some key points to consider when requesting the letter from your school:

1. *Visit Your School*: Approach your school administration or the designated authority for issuing such letters.

2. *Provide Necessary Information*: Ensure that the drafted letter includes essential details such as your identity as a student of the school, your subject combination for A Level exams, and your intention to sit for the exams this academic year.

3. *Printing and Signing*: Request the school to print the letter on official letterhead and have it signed/stamped by the appropriate authority.

4. *Include Authority Details*: Ensure that the letter contains the details of the signing authority, including their full name, contact number, and email ID.
2/1/24, 9:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 9:52 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This letter of recommendation is a crucial document that will support your application process. The Edoofa Academic Board will use those details to reach out to your school authorities and verify the recommendation letter before adding it to your scholarship application and hence I would like to enquire by when will you be able to share the same document with us?
2/1/24, 9:56 PM - +260 96 1242533: You need to give us till next week as currently schools are in recess or holidays.
Moreover commucation with school authorities is practically impossible due to remoteness of the school
2/1/24, 9:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I understand @260961242533, please take your time and obtain the necessary documents as they are needed for your application.
2/1/24, 9:57 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I wish you a good night ahead!
2/1/24, 9:57 PM - +260 96 1242533: Thanks... Goodnite
2/1/24, 9:59 PM - +260 97 7408010: Thanks.... Goodnite
