21/12/23, 3:55 PM - You joined using this group's invite link
21/12/23, 4:02 PM - +263 77 523 7801: Yes you may go ahead please
21/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $550 of the registration fee. This $550 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$275 before the first deadline date of January 3rd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$275 before the second deadline date of February 3rd, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
21/12/23, 4:07 PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $550 within 15 working days, before *January 3rd, 2024* 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
21/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 77 523 7801: I can understand for that is good. Will pay on time we promise
21/12/23, 4:16 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 4:17 PM - Ashi Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 4:19 PM - +263 77 523 7801: Well in Harare l stay in Kambuzuma .
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 4:21 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 4:26 PM - +263 77 523 7801: Thank you so much l will get in touch with Mr Rajan so that he can help  me on how to pay the  payment.
21/12/23, 4:30 PM - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 4:34 PM - +263 77 523 7801: Thank you so much for letting me know one l pay the payment l will send the proof to you.
21/12/23, 4:35 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 4:38 PM - +263 77 523 7801: I understand but l think to pay using Mr Rajan it is wise for you.so today l should get in touch with Mr Rajan today.
21/12/23, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing @263775237801. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
21/12/23, 4:42 PM - Ashi Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
21/12/23, 4:45 PM - +263 77 523 7801: This is a great information it is clear for sure.
21/12/23, 4:46 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Good to hear that @263775237801, Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/12/23, 4:49 PM - +263 77 523 7801: Thank yes l have a queries .well on my offer latter there is an error.the  date of birth it is 8 December 2004.there is an error  there wrote 8 october.can you please help me.
21/12/23, 4:50 PM - +263 77 523 7801: So can l ask well you will be correcting the error a
I can go on paying the registration free right.
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about the error, I will be updating the university officials about the same error. Please don't worry you can go ahead with the payment please.
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable. 

It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
21/12/23, 5:00 PM - Ashi Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/
