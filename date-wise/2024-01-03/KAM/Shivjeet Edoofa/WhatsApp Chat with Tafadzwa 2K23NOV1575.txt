19/12/23, 3:32 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Good afternoon, hope this finds you all well
19/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 77 246 9142: Please note that I have completed the online document. 

More importantly is that some sections I am not sure I completed them correctly. eg where second name was required. For Tafadzwa mother I had to put Surname where second name is required coz she does not have second name.

The form also require father's name... I was not clear whether to put my name or Tafadzwa biological father's name, who is deceased. 

Can this form be reviewed to correct an details that may have been input in error. <This message was edited>

As it has been a while since the last time we were connected I was occupied with the university officials. May I know how are you doing today?

For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?

28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
