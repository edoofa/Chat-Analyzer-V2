29/12/23, 4:05 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Hilton

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. It has been a while since the last time we were connected with each other. As I was occupied with university obligations and Christmas preparations, I would like to take this opportunity to inquire how you are doing today?
29/12/23, 5:33 PM - +263 71 587 1373: I am doing fine how are you doing?
29/12/23, 5:59 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session for the admission process?
29/12/23, 6:00 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes I am
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
29/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes
29/12/23, 6:03 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that we are together so far. With this plan for the next 10 months, I am sure you must be wondering what will happen in the next 10 months, considering you have already secured your scholarship seat with the university due to your hard work in the first 10 months. Is my understanding correct?
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with that as well. In the 11th month, you will be guided to open an FBC Mastercard bank account in Zimbabwe with a deposit of $150. The reason for this is that when you apply for your student Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement, and this account will serve that purpose.
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: We understand it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 for the remaining 10 months in FB  Bank Zimbabwe, so to avoid the same challenges, we have designed the plan accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th month, which is 4 months.
29/12/23, 6:14 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once the 4 months are completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process. The bank statement will act as one of the required documents, and once you receive the visa, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Alrighttt
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Noted
29/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 71 587 1373: It sound okay
29/12/23, 6:50 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, from the 16th Month till the 20th month, considering it is a 6-month window, you can again continue depositing the money ($150) with Edoofa which can be used in the fee as and when required or you can decide to save this $900 of these 6 months with you as well. This is something which you are free to choose. I hope you have understood the financial secure plan now?
29/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 71 587 1373: Yes understood
29/12/23, 8:55 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
