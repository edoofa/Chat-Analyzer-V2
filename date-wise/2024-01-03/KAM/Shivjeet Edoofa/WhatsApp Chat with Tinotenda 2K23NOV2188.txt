I hope this message finds you well and blessed. May I know if you are currently available so that we can proceed with the session for your admission process?
28/12/23, 6:02 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

As it has been a while. May I know how are you doing today?
28/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 78 565 9890: Hello, we are doing okay

28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the forms with me. Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 8:22 PM - +263 71 557 5509: we may start.
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. With that said, there is also another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 7000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day.
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
28/12/23, 8:27 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes that's true.
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to hear, considering these constraints, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any addional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Do you want me to explain how this has been achieved?
28/12/23, 8:30 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes please.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you were asked to pay is $350. From the $350, you have already paid $200, and the remaining $150 is what you are planning to pay by tomorrow before your due date of December 29, 2023.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. 

That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program/Enrollment Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months.
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
28/12/23, 8:39 PM - +263 71 557 5509: the remaining $150 was paid today, and we sent thems receipts to Mr Austin but he hasn't viewed them...i think he busy
28/12/23, 9:09 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is alright, in the meantime shall we proceed with the session for the admission process
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online and proceeding with the session with me for today. As much as I wanted to proceed with the session my available hours are coming to an end I am closing our session for now and let us continue tomorrow properly again. Have a great day and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/12/23, 9:12 PM - +263 71 557 5509: yes
28/12/23, 9:13 PM - +263 71 557 5509: thank you and same to you
29/12/23, 9:22 PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to continue with the session today as I was on a call with the university officials. As my available hours are coming to an end I am closing the session for today and let us connect on the 2nd of January. Along with that, as we stand on the threshold of a new year, I extend my heartfelt wishes to you and your family for a prosperous and fulfilling 2024. May this year bring new opportunities, fresh beginnings, and the realization of your dreams and aspirations.

I hope the coming year is filled with success, health, and happiness for you and your loved ones. May it be a year that surpasses all expectations and is replete with moments of joy and achievement.

Wishing you a Happy New Year⭐
