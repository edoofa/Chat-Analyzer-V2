I hope you are doing well and I wish you a blessed Happy New year. Over the past couple of days I have been trying to reach out to you with regards to our admission process. However all my efforts are in vain now. I even noticed that you even saw my messages as well. Hence I would like to reach out to you once again so that we can proceed with our admission process so that we don't fall behind.
