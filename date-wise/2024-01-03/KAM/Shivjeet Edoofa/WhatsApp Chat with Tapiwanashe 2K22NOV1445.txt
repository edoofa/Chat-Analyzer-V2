Please excuse me for not being able to connect with you the previous day. Thank you for sharing your situation. I completely understand the challenges you're facing with the holiday season and your trip to the rural areas. Your commitment to your family's celebrations is truly admirable. In that case shall I suggest paying the fees early?

I would like to let you know that I have had a discussion with the admission team and the academic board and they have approved your request for the 3rd of January. 

Now, on that note, please write a mail to "academicboard@edoofa.com" stating that you had a discussion with your admission officer Mr. Shivjeet about the cause of the delay in your registration fee and state the reason why and even mention the date and amount that you will be able to pay $321 before 3rd January 2024.

Please also mention your admission group name in the mail, once done share the screenshot with me.
