26/12/23, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley,

I trust this message finds you in good health and that you had a delightful Christmas. Following up on our earlier discussion, I understand that you are scheduled to make a deposit on the 29th of December. I'm reaching out to check on your preparations and to ask if there are any updates or progress you'd like to share with us?
27/12/23, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Ashley,

I trust you're well. I'm following up regarding the message I shared with you above. I was expecting a reply, but it seems my messages might not have been received.

Therefore, I'm reaching out today to check if you had a chance to review my previous message @263773508876 @263714008973 ?
28/12/23, 8:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Ashley.

I hope you're doing well. I've been awaiting a response from you but haven't received an update yet. I wanted to reach out again to check on the status of the payment, as tomorrow is your deadline. It's important for us to provide an update to the university officials accordingly.

Could you please let me know if we are still in communication? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?
28/12/23, 8:25 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Good evening. I just arrived from home for maNyaradzo of my late father Mr Amon Bwititi Mubako. I just arrived in Murambinda and on Saturday l intend to pay the money
28/12/23, 8:26 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Saturday or Sunday
28/12/23, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for updating me. I understand you might be out of town, but considering Ashley's deadline is tomorrow, I'm a bit confused about your plan to make the payment on Saturday. Could you please clarify your reasoning for this timing?

Could you please let me know if you were able to complete the payment today? Your response would be greatly appreciated as it will help us stay on track with the university's requirements?

2/1/24, 12:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 1:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, @263773508876 Mr. Rajan is back in town, and for your ease let me also share Mr. Rajan's mukuru details.

*Rajan Nayer*

Name: Rajan Nayer
Address: 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare
Contact Number: 0772460067
National ID Number: 63 1037566X00
2/1/24, 1:11 PM - +263 71 400 8973: Thus wonderful. I will make the payment on Saturday, right now l am at work. It's the beginning of the year.
2/1/24, 1:18 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263714008973 Thank you for the update. Given the situation, I recommend considering Mukuru for making the payment. As you must be aware the original deadline was set for the 29th of December 2023. The university needs to maintain fairness to all students, and extending the deadline to Saturday could potentially reflect unfavorably on your scholarship application, please.
2/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Let me make the payment Tomorrow. With me here l do not have money
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update, sir. I have a scheduled meeting with the university officials this evening, and I'll take this opportunity to discuss the delay with them. I will inform them that your payment is expected by tomorrow. I trust that you will follow through on this commitment, sir, and I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - +263 77 350 8876: Normally l do not pay large sums of money in Harare. I will prefer to pay to Mr Rajan Nayer because l have seen where he stays
2/1/24, 2:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is alright, please. I completely understand that. I shall wait for an update from your end. Once you have made the payment, please share the receipt with me here.
2/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 77 350 8876: You said l must pay through Mukuru for mukuru it's tomorrow but for physical payment it's on Saturday to Mr Rajan
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's fine, sir. Please note that when you make a payment via Mukuru, you will receive a receipt in the form of text messages. You can then forward that receipt to us for the accounts team to keep a record about the same.
