28/12/23, 3:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please in that case you can update me by tomorrow. In the meantime let us move ahead with our discussion. Let us now discuss your university admission process. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
28/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we shall start
28/12/23, 4:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I have updated the form
28/12/23, 4:17 PM - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>

28/12/23, 5:42 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I had gone through the cycle we can proceed
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
28/12/23, 6:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
28/12/23, 6:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 may I know if we are still connected?
28/12/23, 7:41 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am
28/12/23, 7:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: so may I know if you are clear so far?
28/12/23, 7:51 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes they are clear l got you
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
28/12/23, 7:56 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
28/12/23, 8:04 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But if l may ask do you mean that my academic progress determines the university l will study at
28/12/23, 8:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your concern Mercy, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. 

I hope we are clear here?
28/12/23, 8:14 PM - +263 78 006 5624: How will l get the offer letter
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l understand so l will know how much percentage  of the scholarship will l get after my A level results are out
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Here is the online form it was not send by my Email address l used this one tsitsihwanya04@gmail.com
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for submitting the student application form, it is duly noted with us.
28/12/23, 9:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please note that this is just a brief understanding of what your admission process holds, you will be explained each and every step in detail as we move forward, I would appreciate you being patient, please.

Now if we are clear shall we move ahead?
28/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
28/12/23, 9:52 PM - +263 78 006 5624: You are almost welcome
29/12/23, 9:14 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes we shall move
29/12/23, 9:15 AM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you can we have the conversation
29/12/23, 12:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I hope this message finds you in good health. In continuation of our earlier conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Since we were not able to continue with our discussion yesterday?
29/12/23, 12:57 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes i'm available we can continue
29/12/23, 1:50 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that we can connect now, so may I know if you are clear so far?
29/12/23, 3:57 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l am clear we can move on
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 4:26 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I am supposed to pay the registration fee in how many days
29/12/23, 4:38 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 yes you are correct as your counselor must have informed you. This registration fee is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
29/12/23, 10:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/12/23, 5:16 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l get it
30/12/23, 5:24 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Thank you l aso wish you a happy new year
2/1/24, 1:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Mercy,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. With regard to our conversation, I'm reaching out to check if you are now available to connect with us. Doing so will enable us to proceed with our discussion as we had initially intended.
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Greetings to you how is 2024
2/1/24, 4:10 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I'm available let's proceed
2/1/24, 4:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 thank you for asking, 2024 is starting well. I wish the same for you. I am glad to know that we can connect now. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
2/1/24, 4:21 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Sure we can
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
2/1/24, 4:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
2/1/24, 4:36 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes i'm ready let's move forward
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

https://youtu.be/SIh6DcQsqYM
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you*

This is another video of the founders, where they share the vision of Edoofa at a core level. Founders also talk more about the most important character trait which distinguishes a successful student from the rest of the crowd.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q44qkd4wc7o
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences which students are having in these schools.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW82emflFHw&feature=youtu.be
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
2/1/24, 4:47 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
2/1/24, 8:46 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 may I know if we are still connected I have been anticipating a response from you?
2/1/24, 8:55 PM - +263 78 006 5624: I need 5 days because network is poor
2/1/24, 9:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 I understand that network can be a challenge, however, 5 days is a long time. When we started your admission process initially our aim was to complete the process within 4 days, however, due to the delays we have now reached the first step in your admission cycle, with the speed we are moving ahead I am afraid to say this but you are lacking behind your peers, even your EWYL program was not able to commence on the 29th of the delays we had from your end. I would please encourage you to be more proactive as we have a new EWYL batch upcoming on the 9th of January.
2/1/24, 9:21 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l do understand l will try by all means to consume less time
2/1/24, 9:23 PM - +263 78 006 5624: So do you mean that l am not able to get into the EWYL program
2/1/24, 9:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263780065624 you will now have to update the EWYL pledge form with a new date since you missed the opportunity to start your EWYL program early due to delays. The next batch starts on the 9th of January 2024, may I know if you will be able to join that batch?
2/1/24, 9:30 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Yes l will
2/1/24, 9:31 PM - +263 78 006 5624: But l had sent the form on the 28th of December
2/1/24, 9:32 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In that case, you can share the updated EWYL pledge form by tomorrow, you do not need to print a new one you can update the dates on the same.
2/1/24, 9:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that, however, we did not complete our admission process within that 4 days timeline that we stated above for your EWYL program to start.
2/1/24, 9:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would love to continue with our discussion, since it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's plan to reconnect tomorrow to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
2/1/24, 9:37 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok l do understand
2/1/24, 9:38 PM - +263 78 006 5624: Ok let's connect tomorrow have a blessed night
