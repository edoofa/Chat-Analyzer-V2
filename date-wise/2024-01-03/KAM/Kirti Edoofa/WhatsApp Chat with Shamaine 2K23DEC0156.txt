For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts. I will explain it to you in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
29/12/23, 1:41 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes we can start .
29/12/23, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 1:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have gone through it .
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
29/12/23, 1:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
29/12/23, 1:55 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am they are .
29/12/23, 1:57 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
29/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
29/12/23, 1:59 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
29/12/23, 2:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
29/12/23, 2:01 PM - +27 62 820 6650: They are clear .
29/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we can .
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
29/12/23, 2:10 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I am ready ma'am
29/12/23, 2:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, I shall share the videos with you now.

Edoofa invested 10 years of hardwork to identify good schools , colleges and universities for passionate Edoofians.All the schools and universities under Edoofa are prestigious ,a good and safe environment for the students , moreover , students are able to experience vibrant cultures at the schools .Founders encourage students to follow instructions so as to prepare and be qualified for these prestigious institutions.The last video is about the statement of purpose which is an important document that has all information about the students .This document contains the students vision, academic achievements , personality and goals . Students should invest an hour to fill the form that is provided by the admissions office and answer all questions smartly.The statement of purpose enables students to acquire the best scholarship.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, kindly excuse me for not getting back to you I was occupied in a work meeting. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.

*Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
29/12/23, 9:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
29/12/23, 9:16 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you
I've fully understood.
29/12/23, 9:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*.

29/12/23, 9:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job.

29/12/23, 9:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>

I wish you a happy new year
29/12/23, 9:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome and thank you so much.
29/12/23, 9:50 PM - +27 62 820 6650: You are welcome
29/12/23, 9:50 PM - +27 73 501 5592: Thank you so much. We wish you a happy, prosperous New Year as well. All the guidance is greatly appreciated.
30/12/23, 7:53 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good evening
30/12/23, 7:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 2 .Is there such a thing as a social structure that constrains individual action , or is society nothing more than a figment of our imagination? 



Social structure refers to institutions and patterns that shape the society.It plays a significant role in enabling and also constraining individual action. The social structure had norms and values that guide individuals in doing what is acceptable and considered appropriate in the society.There are also legal systems for instance laws and regulations that constrain individuals from committing crimes since there are penalties for doing that . Cultural norms and values and also social roles such as those associated with family or work discourage and limits certain behaviors by prescribing specific expectations for how men and women should behave .However, the social structure can also enable individual behavior by providing opportunities for actions . Nevertheless, society is not just a figment of human imaginations .It is a vital and complex system that is shaped by individuals and their actions while individual actions also shape the society. Therefore , social structure does constrain individual action to a greater extent by perpetuating the way people do things the way they have always been done .
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 3 . Explain the relation between sociology and Economics .


Sociology deals with relationships between humans and society while economics is an age-old institution that is used to deal with the changing patterns in society. There are similarities and differences between Economics and Sociology and one of the similarities is that both sociology and economics both  use scientific methods for studying the society. Another similarity is that both sociology and economics are branches of social science that deal with the study of human development . Economics and sociology are dependent on each other for their study. Economics, as it is mainly concerned with man's economic aspects , is also directly correlated to society's social activities . Similarly , sociology is concerned with the study of social beings , therefore , economic factors highly impact it . Moreover , economics is considered a branch of social science hence ,it's considered to be a branch of sociology . Nonetheless , there are also differences between these two branches for instance sociology is concerned with the social activities of individuals whereas economics is concerned with the individual's economic activities . Thus , sociology primarily studies society and social relationships while economics studies society and wealth . Therefore , sociology and economics have an inter-dependent relationship .
2/1/24, 12:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: <Media omitted>
2/1/24, 12:06 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 4 .What us the role of institutions in society - do they perform positive functions or simply work in the interests of the powerful against the powerless ? 



The role of institutions in society is complex .Some institutions perform positive functions such as maintaining social order , infrastructure and provide essential services thereby promoting the well being of people. Public institutions have a duty of maintaining public safety, examples of the institutions being the army and police .When these institutions work honestly and correctly without corruption, they work in the interests of everyone , thus , they perform positive functions. However, they also work in the interests of the powerful as most are corrupt. The civil government is instituted for the security of everyone but in reality it is instituted for the defense of the rich against the poor . The religious institutions help those in need by giving food and clothes sometimes even shelter and education. Nevertheless, they also stand up for the rich and powerful. These institutions that work in the interests of the powerful are mostly driven by greed of the benefits that come from  taking the side of the powerful rich people. To conclude, institutions perform a bigger role in society as they provide education , protection medical services and other services . Therefore , these institutions do perform positive functions but also work in the interests of the powerful against the powerless to a greater extent .
2/1/24, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Shamaine,

I hope this message finds you in good health and you had a delightful New Year. Thank you for submitting your SOP, the academic interview questions. It is well noted with us, and we have shared the same with the admissions team as well. They will now evaluate your response and will be proceeding to work on them so that your university application is well prepared.
2/1/24, 1:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Good afternoon
2/1/24, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings. *Now with this, we have completed the second step of your university admission cycle, and hence we will move forward to the third step in your admission journey.*
2/1/24, 2:39 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Question 5 . Explain primary and secondary groups as the two sociological groups and elaborate with examples about in-groups and out-groups as subtypes of primary and secondary groups.


Primary groups are small and made up of individuals who have the most impact on our socialization. They are characterized by close and intimate relationships that last a long time, maybe a lifetime. These relationships are very  personal and contain a lot of emotions .The members typically include family, childhood friends, romantic partners, and members of religious groups who have regular face-to-face or verbal interaction and a shared culture .In primary groups relationships are bound by love ,care , support ,and loyalty .These relationships play important roles in the formation of individuals' sense of self and identity because these people are influential in the development of norms values , beliefs and everyday behaviors . Secondary groups are larger and impersonal .These often have an organized structure , an authority figure who oversees the rules while primary groups are typically informally organized .In secondary groups there are no intimate or close relationships .These groups are functional groups created to carry out a task and achieve goals .A person becomes a member of the secondary voluntarily . Common examples of this group include coworkers at a workplace,students or teachers at a school. In-groups are subtypes of primary groups .They are formed according to race , gender, culture ,age or religion .Out-groups are groups that an individual feels like they don't belong to .An example of an out-group may be a political party that you do not support or a sports team .
2/1/24, 2:45 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
2/1/24, 2:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now before we move ahead, I have a some news to share with you. 

https://chat.whatsapp.com/Hdku83FObPZEm9TChSEzcC

"Use the above-provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Shamaine Chari, and my EWYL group name is Shamaine EWYL23E1037. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on 05/01/2024 to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*"
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: "Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________"
2/1/24, 2:49 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am thank you
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. To be on the same page, If I am correct, I believe you want to pursue a bachelor's degree in the course BA (Sociology) for your higher education in India as per the August 2024 intake?
2/1/24, 2:54 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission* Are you ready to start with that?
2/1/24, 2:56 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes I am ready.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
2/1/24, 3:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
2/1/24, 3:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes it's not possible
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
2/1/24, 3:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
2/1/24, 3:05 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
2/1/24, 3:06 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am we discussed it
2/1/24, 3:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am,we are .
2/1/24, 3:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
2/1/24, 3:16 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I've understood
2/1/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
2/1/24, 3:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $1000 = $1800. This amount can be paid in two installments of $900 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $900 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
2/1/24, 3:23 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
2/1/24, 3:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
2/1/24, 3:25 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay ma'am that sounds better
2/1/24, 3:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 3:27 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am I've understood everything
2/1/24, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.

2/1/24, 3:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

2/1/24, 3:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Indeed it will. I am looking forward to meeting with you.

Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
2/1/24, 3:58 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you so much 🙏
2/1/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
2/1/24, 3:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
2/1/24, 4:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
2/1/24, 4:03 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I have gone through it <This message was edited>
2/1/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -

*1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
2/1/24, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
2/1/24, 4:23 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Okay noted
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - +27 62 820 6650: This is wonderful o
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
2/1/24, 4:25 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 4:28 PM - +27 62 820 6650: This is wonderful news
2/1/24, 4:29 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am it does
2/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $1000, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $900.
2/1/24, 4:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $1000 fee, you will only be required to pay $900. Once this payment is completed, the entire $1000 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $1000. Does this explanation resonate with you?
2/1/24, 4:33 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Hello Admission officer , I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor . The name of my Mentor is Ms Ananya and she has scheduled my session for 4 January.
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for the update. It's great to hear that you've connected with your EWYL Mentor, Ms. Ananya. I appreciate you sharing the session date with us. 

Please make sure to mark your calendar for the session scheduled date. This mentorship opportunity can provide valuable insights and guidance for her academic and personal development. Wish you all the best!
2/1/24, 4:34 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Yes ma'am.
2/1/24, 4:35 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you ma'am.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, now coming back to your last benefit. 

*4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $100 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
2/1/24, 4:48 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for January 10, 2024, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $900, you'll need to make a payment of $450 on or before January 10, 2024. The remaining $450 should be paid by February 10 2024. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
2/1/24, 4:57 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am I've understood everything
2/1/24, 4:59 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
2/1/24, 5:00 PM - +27 62 820 6650: No ma'am right now I do not have any queries,I've understood everything that you said .
2/1/24, 5:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As Shamaine's guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
2/1/24, 5:13 PM - +27 62 820 6650: I am very excited, I can't wait .
2/1/24, 5:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
2/1/24, 5:15 PM - +27 62 820 6650: Thank you and have a wonderful night .
