If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 11:18 AM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes.
19/12/23, 11:19 AM - +263 71 389 4785: The registration fee should be paid within 30days of the insurance of this letter or 31 December 2023
19/12/23, 1:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, may I know why were you not able to connect with us yesterday at the scheduled time?
19/12/23, 1:41 PM - +263 71 389 4785: I am doing quite well and you . There was network downfall, I am very sorry about that.
19/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I completely understand that the network can be a challenge in that case, could you let me know a time by when you will be available to connect with us so that we can have a discussion?
19/12/23, 1:52 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Now.
19/12/23, 1:59 PM - +263 71 389 4785: From 12.00PM
19/12/23, 4:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know that, in that case, may I know daily from 12:30 pm to 04:00 pm you will be available to connect with us?
19/12/23, 6:27 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I will be available.
19/12/23, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to know that, may I know if you are available now so that we can at least start our discussion?
19/12/23, 6:42 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I am available now.
19/12/23, 6:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes that's true.
19/12/23, 7:11 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from Lovely Professional University, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any queries you have. For us to begin our conversation, I want you to look at the letter again and tell me the following so that I know you have read it well -

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission Processing Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What’s the Registration fee?
19/12/23, 7:16 PM - +263 71 389 4785: 1.975USD
2.3years(6 semesters)
3.200USD
4.700USD
19/12/23, 7:40 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Yes, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter, your course is a 3-year-long course, and each year is divided into 2 semesters, this means that you will have 6 semesters in your degree.*

After the scholarship, your per semester tuition fee is $975 making your per annum tuition fee ($975*2) = $1950. Is that clear?
20/12/23, 11:40 AM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
20/12/23, 12:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon parents and Patience,

I trust you are all doing well. Following up on our previous conversation, since we were unable to continue with our discussion. I'm reaching out to see if you are currently available to engage with us. This would allow us to go ahead with our discussion as planned.
20/12/23, 12:23 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I'm fine. How are you?
20/12/23, 12:23 PM - +263 71 389 4785: I am available
20/12/23, 12:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. I am glad to know that we can connect now. So may I know if you are clear so far?
20/12/23, 12:33 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes.
20/12/23, 12:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Let me also brief you on the two categories of accommodation that are available at LPU -
20/12/23, 12:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels inside LPU have different categories. Standard Room with Air Cooler and Standard Room with Air Conditioner with a different number of seaters, the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want.

The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a standard four-seater air cooler room is $1125 and the per annum standard mess/food service fee is $550 and this increases with the type of room/meal plan you choose.
20/12/23, 12:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

We also have many students in India who have opted for accommodation outside the LPU campus considering it is more affordable, the cost will be around $1000 per annum and that includes Rent, Food, Wifi Service, and other basic amenities such as water and electricity bills.

The outside accommodations are safe. Students have an option to cook for themselves, along with that they find a community of Edoofians from Africa who are already studying at the same university as them.
20/12/23, 12:34 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay.
20/12/23, 12:35 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay clear.
20/12/23, 12:36 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Alright noted.
20/12/23, 12:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you decide to stay on campus, the university officials will help you settle and will be taking responsibility for your well-being, our per annum accommodation cost will be $1675.

However, if a student doesn’t wish to stay on campus and is looking for more affordable accommodation options, in that case, they can go with the off-campus accommodation where their per annum cost would be around $1000 including the food cost and they can also cook food for themselves.
20/12/23, 12:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: For the off-campus accommodation, you can connect with any of the Edoofians staying off-campus, and he/she would help you look for the off-campus accommodation options. If you are not connected with any students, we will help you connect with them near your time of arrival so that they can help you with the off-campus accommodation options.
20/12/23, 12:37 PM - Kirti Edoofa: *LPU never forces anyone to choose the Hostel, they ask them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she wants to stay inside or outside the campus. Are you clear on this?*
20/12/23, 12:41 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes it's clear
20/12/23, 12:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You also have the examination fee of $75 which is due every semester, and the health insurance fee. A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and they can get it from the university itself and it would cost them $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this?
20/12/23, 12:47 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
20/12/23, 12:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $700 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 31st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/12/23, 12:59 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes we are together. Is it allowed to pay the $350 and will pay the remaining $350 in January
20/12/23, 1:01 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you better here by recalling our old conversation. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $100 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/12/23, 1:19 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
20/12/23, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of Decemeber 31, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 31, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/12/23, 1:22 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 31, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/12/23, 1:24 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay. Understood.
20/12/23, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/12/23, 1:26 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/12/23, 1:30 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay
20/12/23, 1:31 PM - +263 71 389 4785: I stay in the city of Mberengwa.
20/12/23, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/12/23, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/12/23, 1:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay.
20/12/23, 1:36 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Thank you
20/12/23, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/12/23, 1:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/12/23, 1:38 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay. Noted
20/12/23, 1:39 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
20/12/23, 1:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
20/12/23, 1:42 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Thank you for this please!
20/12/23, 1:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that you know your per annum educational expenses for your education abroad, let me also help you understand how you can make your education more affordable.
20/12/23, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the complete per annum fee is to be paid by the student, however, for students under the Edoofa Program, they have an additional opportunity of the EWYL Program. Because of that, you as a student can earn $800 to $1200 worth of scholarship credits in a year and use them to pay a part of your fee.
20/12/23, 1:43 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that the above range shared does not mean that a student can earn credits only up to $1200. There is no upper limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits.

In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his or her higher education, he/she can earn accordingly. Are you clear on this?
20/12/23, 1:45 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes it's clear.
20/12/23, 1:51 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now, do you have any queries that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
20/12/23, 1:53 PM - +263 71 389 4785: No I don't have .
20/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Let me also share a few insights into the university with you -
20/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: LPU is one of the best universities in India and it has been ranked in the top 80 universities worldwide, because of its international tie-ups, the exposure a student gets at the university is indomitable.
20/12/23, 1:53 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It has a campus of 800 acres, with over 100,000 students studying from all over the world. Students from LPU are placed at Microsoft, Google, IMF, Work Bank, and many more. It has spent a lot of money building the infrastructure so that a quality service can be given to the students.
20/12/23, 1:54 PM - Kirti Edoofa: The students at LPU are not only looking for Academics but holistic development is given the utmost importance. The students there can join clubs to represent the University in various competitions like MUN, Debate, and Sports along with various other activities.

As you can not visit the campus and see it for yourself, in that case, you can take a virtual tour of the campus, it is open 24/7 and is never off. Here is the link for the same - https://www.lpu.in/virtual-tour/

20/12/23, 1:56 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Alright
20/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now,  before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
20/12/23, 1:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.

This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be tomorrow same time. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
20/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes that's true.
20/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 71 389 4785: This message was deleted

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Lovely Professional University as a collective?
21/12/23, 8:20 AM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes we did.
21/12/23, 12:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well. I was hoping to get a response from you yesterday, may I know what happened, due to which you were not able to connect with us yesterday?
21/12/23, 12:40 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I am fine. How are you? At 6.00PM I won't be available just because it will not be good for me to search for a network that time as I said before.
21/12/23, 12:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. It is alright please, I understand if it is alright with you we can connect now and continue with our discussion?

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?

21/12/23, 3:36 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am comfortable to hear about their positive thoughts regarding it. 

Moving forward, after your recent family discussion regarding the offer letter, we genuinely want to ensure that you have all the necessary information and support you may require. Therefore, I would like to ask if you have any specific questions or concerns regarding the offer letter before proceeding further?

Rest assured, as promised, I am here to engage in a meaningful discussion and offer my support to help you plan effectively. 

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?

To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.

21/12/23, 3:58 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Ok thank you.
21/12/23, 4:01 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Ok I am thankful to let me connect with the other Edoofian.
21/12/23, 4:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Moving forward, I would like to discuss your plans for securing your scholarship seat so that we can communicate them with the university. 

As the university has set a deadline of December 31, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $300, or you can opt to pay the full $600 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
21/12/23, 4:14 PM - +263 71 389 4785: I will make an initial payment of $300.
21/12/23, 4:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this.

26/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Patience.

I hope you are doing well and had a delightful Christmas celebration. Thank you for sharing your concern with me here. Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.
26/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.
26/12/23, 2:02 PM - Kirti Edoofa: After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. If you have any university on your mind, you can let me know and we will surely look into your inclinations as well.
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 389 4785: I am fine and you. Okay
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by the Lovely Professional University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great.
26/12/23, 2:05 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay.  I know Quest University.
26/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes it's clear.
26/12/23, 2:07 PM - +263 71 389 4785: You are welcome.
26/12/23, 2:08 PM - Kirti Edoofa: At the same time, since it is an associated university with Edoofa, we have already shared your application with Quest Group of  Institue for a scholarship application and we are currently waiting for an update from them. 

As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by LPU, you would lose out on the scholarship from LPU and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
26/12/23, 2:12 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Okay. No I am not.
26/12/23, 2:14 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with LPU by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at LPU without risking losing out on the scholarship.
26/12/23, 2:15 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $700 to LPU to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $700.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $700, but because you would have already paid $700 for LPU, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $700 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
26/12/23, 2:16 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Alright thank you for letting me know.
26/12/23, 2:16 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, I am sure now your concern is addressed?
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes I understand now.
26/12/23, 2:17 PM - +263 71 389 4785: Yes
26/12/23, 2:19 PM - +263 71 389 4785: So I am going to deposit the registration fee on the due date I mentioned or ? May you please help me.
26/12/23, 2:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: @263713894785 Yes you can deposit the registration fee on the date you mentioned, however, If you plan to make the payment through Mr. Rajan you can surely do that however, please note that Mr. Rajan will not be available till the 2nd of January 2024.
