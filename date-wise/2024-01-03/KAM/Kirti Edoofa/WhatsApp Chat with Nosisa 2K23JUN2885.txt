3. What is you r annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your  Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)

19/12/23, 6:41 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok am on it <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 6:42 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, I will wait for your response.
19/12/23, 6:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: #1:$350
#2:$0
#3:1600
#4:$125+125=$150
#5:$1000
19/12/23, 7:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per the offer letter, MVN University has awarded a 90% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you don't have to pay any tuition fees throughout the course duration. This is a significant achievement and will greatly reduce the financial burden on your family.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in the letter, he has also been awarded a 100% waiver on the accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided will be free of cost throughout the stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it? <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 78 035 0406: It iz
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
19/12/23, 7:10 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, your annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you?
19/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes ma'am thank you for the clarification
19/12/23, 9:01 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Let's move on the duration of tym prior to payments
19/12/23, 9:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
19/12/23, 9:26 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thnk u so much
20/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Greetings
20/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Hope I found you well
20/12/23, 6:01 PM - +263 78 035 0406: To begin to day , there is this saying "success do not come on a silver platter"
20/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Therefore one has to work very hard so as to archieve the intended goals
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nosisa,

I trust you are all doing well. Thank you for asking, I am doing great Following up on our previous conversation, and the quote you shared on that note let us start with our discussion. So may I know if you are ready to start with our discussion today?
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes I am ready
20/12/23, 6:06 PM - +263 78 035 0406: We may continue
20/12/23, 6:09 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing so may I know if you are clear so far?
20/12/23, 6:12 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Understood
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to hear that. If you have any questions on your mind or need further clarification, please feel free to bring them up. Also, now that you're aware of your per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
20/12/23, 6:13 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make his/her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
20/12/23, 6:14 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I have understood the above let us continue
20/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $1850, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
20/12/23, 6:21 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes it's clear
20/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 78 035 0406: What is the amount of the money that is supposed to be paid I the period 15days as mentioned
20/12/23, 6:25 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Maybe you may help me <This message was edited>
20/12/23, 6:33 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes Nosisa, we will be discussing the same, please do not worry. I would really encourage you to be a little patient, please.
20/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok maam thank you
20/12/23, 6:33 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Let us continue
20/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of his/her annual fee, which is $1250. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how one can effectively make their education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/12/23, 6:34 PM - +263 78 035 0406: This is clear
20/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/12/23, 6:35 PM - Kirti Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1850 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same. Giving you a total of $850 for your university fees. I hope I am clear to you?
20/12/23, 6:38 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes maaam
20/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 78 035 0406: But I would greatly appreciate if u give a brief explanation about wat does MVN stand for
20/12/23, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Surely Nosisa. Mvn stands for Modern Vidya Niketan Univeristy. I would have shared the same with you during the insights of the university as well.
20/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok thank you
20/12/23, 6:43 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Let's continue
20/12/23, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
20/12/23, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of your application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for you. This is the reason the per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
20/12/23, 6:45 PM - Kirti Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. Rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of your first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
20/12/23, 6:47 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that you have understood really well. In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for you is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
20/12/23, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
20/12/23, 6:49 PM - Kirti Edoofa: It's essential to consider the big picture and the overall financial benefits that come with the scholarship offer you have received. Do you not agree with this?
20/12/23, 6:51 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:00 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,850. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you arrive in India will be $1,850 - $1,000 = $850 and this amount can be paid in two installments of $425 and $425, spaced 6 months apart.

The first installment can be paid either before arrival in India or within three days of arrival in August 2024. The second installment will be due in the subsequent semester, in January 2025.

I hope this clarifies the fee structure, and are we aligned on these options?
20/12/23, 7:02 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes this is clear
20/12/23, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as January 02nd 2024*.
20/12/23, 7:04 PM - Kirti Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/12/23, 7:05 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Yes explain please
20/12/23, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *January 2nd, 2024* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *February 2nd 2024,* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/12/23, 7:07 PM - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before January 2nd*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/12/23, 7:10 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you understand better what you are referring to right now is your full tuition fee for the first year, however, as you remember to get admission to a university you would first need to register your seat with the same. The $1000 here is the registration fee, which is to be paid by the student/parent to reserve their scholarship seat with the university and it is not an additional cost, it is part of your first-year tuition fee which is paid while you are in your home country and it will be adjusted against your first-year cost of education hence making your registration fee as zero.

I hope we are clear here?
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If we adjust the registration fee from your total tuition fee for the first year which is $1850- $1000 then you are left with $850 which you can pay after you arrive in India, as explained above.
20/12/23, 7:20 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:21 PM - Kirti Edoofa: If you recall our conversation above the endowment program is a additional benefit for you to reduce your registration fee. The $150 is a grant for you on your registration fee by Edoofa.
20/12/23, 7:22 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 7:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the registration fee is to be paid at once as per the deadlines stated by the university, however, since your application was processed under the Endowment Plan through Edoofa, you have already been given a payment plan where your registration fee can be paid in two installments of $425 each and the deadlines are given by the university.
20/12/23, 9:54 PM - +263 78 035 0406: 425+425=850
20/12/23, 9:55 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Isnt that am supposed to pay $1000
20/12/23, 10:17 PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you earlier, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours, let's reconnect tomorrow at 06:00 pm CAT to continue our discussion. I'm optimistic that you'll be able to connect then. Have a great night, and looking forward to our conversation tomorrow.
20/12/23, 10:19 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you, sleep tight
21/12/23, 5:52 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Greetings
21/12/23, 5:55 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening parents and Nosisa,

I trust you are all doing well. Following up on our previous conversation, May I know if you are currently available to engage with us. This would allow us to proceed with our discussion as planned.
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Let's continue ma'am
21/12/23, 5:56 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you
21/12/23, 5:58 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Now let me help you explain, the $150 grant that you have received is on your registration fee only @263780350406 hence making your registration fee $850 which can be further paid in two installments as per the deadlines shared by the university.
21/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank you that has been made clear
21/12/23, 6:02 PM - +263 78 035 0406: So what would be the remaining amount am expected to pay when I arrive india
21/12/23, 6:19 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Nosisa, I did make you understand your query here, may I know if you were able to go through this?
21/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I understand now
21/12/23, 6:24 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Thank yu
21/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
21/12/23, 6:24 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
21/12/23, 6:26 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I stay in Gweru maam never been to harare
21/12/23, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
21/12/23, 6:30 PM - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
21/12/23, 6:31 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
21/12/23, 6:32 PM - +263 78 035 0406: Ok thank you maam
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
21/12/23, 6:34 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi’s FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 78 035 0406: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 6:36 PM - +263 78 035 0406: U can share please
21/12/23, 6:39 PM - +263 78 035 0406: I mean can the payment be made through me kawadza shorwi
21/12/23, 6:41 PM - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please. Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference - 

Bank Name: FBC
