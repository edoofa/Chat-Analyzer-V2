We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program.

Due to the overwhelming response from applicants, we wanted to ensure you receive personalized attention. Therefore, we've scheduled a dedicated time slot just for you:

Please mark the time to ensure you're available for this important counseling session as your active participation is an important parameter for evaluation.
