28/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 372 9314: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 10:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, please share the term results too
28/12/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 372 9314: Okay

28/12/23, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing these, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Deon about achieving it
28/12/23, 11:12 am - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
28/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 372 9314: No we haven't
28/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 372 9314: Okay that's great news... I have faith that Deon will do great
28/12/23, 11:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 372 9314: Well noted thank you
28/12/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Ms. Elizabeth, I would like to know if Deon was interested in Software Engineering, so why she hasn't opted for Chemistry or Physics at A level?
28/12/23, 11:45 am - +263 77 372 9314: Okay that's because she was told that the combination she did offered many opportunities in the event that she doesn't get a place she still has many other opportunities
28/12/23, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Elizabeth, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
28/12/23, 11:49 am - Pallika Edoofa: SO, May I know here alternate career aspirations, please.
28/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 77 372 9314: Oky, business administration, marketing or information technology
28/12/23, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this.
28/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 372 9314: Okay l hope her combination meets the program requirements
28/12/23, 12:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Ms. Elizabeth, Considering her subjects and interests and serving as her counselor, I would recommend pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) based on the alignment with her academic focus and areas of interest.




Do, you want me to explain in depth?
28/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 372 9314: Yes please
