21/11/23, 4:47 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Mrs. Otilia!
21/11/23, 6:33 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Amazing.I have read all the information.Umm there is holistic education in India.
21/11/23, 6:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Laurrie to India for her higher studies!
21/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes yes I'm very much interested.I am expecting her to be one of the selected students to study in India
21/11/23, 6:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
21/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Umm I don't have any idea
21/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Mrs. Otilia! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
21/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
21/11/23, 6:45 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
21/11/23, 8:21 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Umm we cannot afford the fees with what we earn.Our salary is 300us per month and Laurrie have other siblings who are still going to schoolHer other sibling Laurrah19 years completed A level last year and she is at home.We are failing to raise money for her to go university . Looking for a scholarship means we need assistance for Laurrie to achieve her goals
21/11/23, 8:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Mrs. Otilia. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
21/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 357 4276: I heard this from others but I have no idea on how it is done.Can you please explain further
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Laurrie. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
21/11/23, 9:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
21/11/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes this will benefit Laurrie If given the earn while you learn program she will work very hard so as to achieve her goals.Laurrie have a poor background which will remind her to work hard
21/11/23, 9:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
21/11/23, 9:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
21/11/23, 9:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
21/11/23, 9:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

22/11/23, 12:26 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes with this EWYL we can try our best but what if they failed to give her the Earn While You Learn program
22/11/23, 1:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your query, Mrs. Otilia?
22/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 357 4276: We are expecting 100% scholarship.so that it will be easy for us to give Laurrie pocket only.Here in Zimbabwe we just earn a few US$ .we have other children failing to study go to university.Our fear is on this program EWYLif she misses the opportunity it will be a challenge on her and us parents.
22/11/23, 4:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Otilia. Pursuing tertiary education abroad requires financial planning. May I know whether you have contrived a financial plan for the respective decision?
22/11/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes we are planning.we have plans on Laurrie' education
22/11/23, 8:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please shed light on that, Mrs. Otilia?
22/11/23, 10:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 11:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*"Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle." – Christian D. Larson*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
23/11/23, 12:54 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Afternoon.I am ready
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Otilia!
23/11/23, 1:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Otilia, may I inquire if you are familiar with the criteria for receiving a 100% scholarship and the recipients of such scholarships?
23/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 357 4276: I don't know much
23/11/23, 1:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic (A Grades in all subjects for A-level and O-level)
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Work Experience (if any)
6. Recommendation from Edoofa.

May I know whether Laurrie fulfills the criteria, please?
23/11/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Thank you she doesn't fulfill
23/11/23, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Otilia. I trust you are aware of the affordable and high-quality education that India offers. Additionally, our distinctive *EWYL* program provides students with practical experience, allowing them to self-finance a significant portion of their education costs. Could you kindly share if you have formulated a plan for your daughter's education?
23/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 357 4276: As said before.We are saving something for her.We are going to work hard and put more effort on our vegetable project
23/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
23/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
23/11/23, 3:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
23/11/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 357 4276: All the points are very important but  point  number 4 is the best
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Otilia! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have their backs!
23/11/23, 4:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how you feel about Laurrie studying abroad?
23/11/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 357 4276: I'm curious now for Laurrie to study abroad..Edoofa prepare the learners for the real world.I also admire the practical training you give them.The work while you learn program also reduces the fear from us It will be easy for us to assist Laurrie's education
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate her career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling her to independently support her family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for her parents.
23/11/23, 4:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
23/11/23, 4:20 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Ok
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 4:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*

27/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 77 357 4276: I mean we prefer applying through Edoofa program of $350
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Mrs. Otilia! Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
27/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
27/11/23, 7:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
27/11/23, 8:00 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes

27/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Understood
27/11/23, 8:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!

*"Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot, but make it hot by striking." - William Butler Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
29/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
29/11/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Sorry for not responding.I was very busy
29/11/23, 9:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mrs. Otilia!
29/11/23, 9:03 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: We are left with Step 5 and Step 6.
So shall I explain them to you?
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Yes you can explain
29/11/23, 9:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?
29/11/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 357 4276: Very clear
29/11/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India.

This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

11/12/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 357 4276: On number 7 we are clear
12/12/23, 11:48 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing please?
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 357 4276: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 1:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023 for $200 and the 17th  or 18th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 17th  or 18th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
13/12/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 357 4276: I will discuss this issue of registration money with her father right now he is not at home.He is out of town.He is experiencing network challenges
13/12/23, 8:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: What challenges are you facing ?
14/12/23, 11:39 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
14/12/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 591 9899: Good afternoon colleagues.thank you for taking your time with us,your counseling sessions etc.
We would prefer option number 1 which is a little bit flexible.however,the challenges we are having is of time frame.the deadline of December 17&18 is very close.currrently we are working on term 1 2024 school fees for Laurie, and Lauriate Sibongile her sister.the other challenge is that the deadline is before our pay day for December.i think if given time eg for January 2024 would help us.our greatest challenge is financial.we earn Zimbabwe dollars which need to be converted to US dollars and the exchange rates are very high
14/12/23, 3:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Laurrie, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Laurrie's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
15/12/23, 11:01 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

19/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 591 9899: Ready to discuss/hear from the academic board's response
19/12/23, 12:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Dube's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Dube's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
19/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 591 9899: We would be very comfortable if we can complete the enrollment formalities in January
