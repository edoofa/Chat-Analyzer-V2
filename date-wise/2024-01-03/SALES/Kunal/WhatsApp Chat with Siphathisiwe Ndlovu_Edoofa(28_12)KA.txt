Edoofians can reduce their fees by taking part in the Earn as you learn program whereby they take part in practical work which in turn helps them to be able to get familiar with the ever changing technology.l have also noted that once you have been selected by the academic board,they help with your visa application but you are the one who pays for it.

02/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 78 808 6423: I learned that edoofians cannot work in India as they only have student visas and not work visas ,so they have to have someone to finance their stay abroad.The edoofians also enjoy low fees in their enrollment into a college since most universities in lndia are familiar with Edoofa program
02/01/24, 12:32 pm - Kunal: Alright, so have you discussed about these aspects with your family?
02/01/24, 12:34 pm - +263 78 808 6423: Yes

02/01/24, 1:03 pm - Kunal: Alright
As per your understanding from the document, may I know what is the cost of education for an international student offered by Edoofa?
02/01/24, 1:06 pm - +263 78 808 6423: $2000 to $3000
02/01/24, 1:09 pm - +263 78 808 6423: This reduces if the student takes part in the Earn as you learn program whereby the student earns scholarship credits
02/01/24, 1:10 pm - Kunal: That is correct, Sipathisiwe
May I know what fascinated you to pursue a course and career in Accounting?
02/01/24, 1:22 pm - +263 78 808 6423: Well l can say l was lnspired by my teachers who made it interesting and l fell in love with it knowing it's a profession that most people/business organisations require
02/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 808 6423: I also love working with numbers and challenging my brain by solving puzzles and other things, moreover l believe accounting is a respectable profession as it helps most businesses to achieve certain goals by providing accurate financial information
02/01/24, 1:31 pm - Kunal: I see you are well motivated towards this career path and looking forward to excelling in it.
So, to take forward your evaluation, I would now like you to share with me your previous qualification results i.e form 5 or term and O level results, please?
A picture would be better
02/01/24, 1:44 pm - +263 78 808 6423: <Media omitted>
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
02/01/24, 1:52 pm - +263 78 808 6423: I am confident about achieving it
02/01/24, 2:19 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
