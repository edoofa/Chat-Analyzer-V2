20/12/23, 10:10 am - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*


In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later

02/01/24, 12:19 pm - Kunal: Greetings to you all

I was waiting for you to share your concerns with me but unfortunately, I didn’t hear from you and therefore I was asked to put your application on hold, but before doing the same, I was going through the form you submitted, I noticed that you come from a family background wherein you plan to pursue your higher education abroad and was looking for a scholarship. I am looking forward to hearing from you so that I can make your dream of higher education abroad come true through an affordable, accessible, and employment-oriented higher education program.

*Please Note by tomorrow*, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply
