27/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 78 807 1310: My name is Sharon Tadiwanashe Mushamba .I am 18 years old. I was born in Maphisa District Hospital in Matebeleland South. I like reading novels on my spare time. My strength is socializing with people and my weakness is low confidence. I grew up in a family of the three children with me being the first born, followed by my younger brother Shepherd Tawananyasha Mushamba then the last born Shayne Thembinkosi Mushamba. My parents are Pastors in The Salvation Army church .Due to their profession I've changed different languages and schools because they would be changed from place to place for them to spread the word of God. In Primary School I first learnt in Lwendulu Primary School in Hwange then on the third grade my parents were moved from Hwange to Harare and there I faced language barriers because in Hwange we used Ndebele,Nyanja and Nambya whilst in Harare Shona was the main language, from Grade 3 up to Grade 7 I learnt at Budiriro 3 Primary School then I came out with 8units .Then I went to Bradley High school for the next level,I wrote my Olevel there where I was doing commercials then I  came out with 9 Olevels out of 10...the one I failed is Mathematics. I rewrote the subject then I passed .I went on to pursue my Advanced level at the same school where I was doing Arts . I was doing Family and Religious Studies, History and Literature in English. Currently I'm waiting for my results. My mother wants to pursue a degree in Religious Studies and my father recently Graduated in his Masters degree in Religious Studies. The second born Shepherd Tawananyasha Mushamba is in Grade 5 whilst Shayne Thembinkosi Mushamba is in Grade 1 at Minda Mission Primary in Matebeleland South. The Salvation Army has been supporting me by paying 50% of my school fees in my Education but when one turns 18 they would no longer be supportive. My parents will be the one to take over and support me in my higher education. My high school fees was $500USD per each term.
I would like to pursue Human Resources Management or Law depending on my results and the required passes in your programs

27/12/23, 10:40 am - Kunal: Thank you for sharing
I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
27/12/23, 10:41 am - +263 78 807 1310: I am more than confident because I work hard to make my parents proud
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: Good to hear that
27/12/23, 10:44 am - Kunal: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion towards law, you are eligible to pursue

27/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 78 807 1310: I think I'll get to know more if I get a chance to study there.
27/12/23, 11:37 am - +263 78 807 1310: This is impressive
27/12/23, 11:40 am - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 78 807 1310: Mmmm to be honest I'm not familiar with any
27/12/23, 11:41 am - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
27/12/23, 11:42 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:42 am - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
27/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 807 1310: Oooooh okay.
I get it Sir
27/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 807 1310: Wow
27/12/23, 11:47 am - +263 78 807 1310: I get it Sir
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: Let me help you understand more on

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/12/23, 11:49 am - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 807 1310: Ooh I see
27/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 807 1310: The Earn while you Earn program seems to a good one because it can help reduce my fees through partaking in the different projects.
27/12/23, 11:53 am - Kunal: Indeed
If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
27/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 807 1310: Ooooohkay sir yeah I understand
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 

 1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: 2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: 3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn
27/12/23, 11:56 am - Kunal: *4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different.
Let me know which point out of 4 you like the most
27/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 807 1310: Number 4
27/12/23, 11:58 am - +263 78 807 1310: This is because the program shows to have great care of their students and great support which leaves me optimistic about this whole Edoofa program
27/12/23, 12:00 pm - Kunal: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on quality education and guidance.
Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While you Learn.

27/12/23, 12:01 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
27/12/23, 12:09 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I think my parents will
27/12/23, 12:11 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I see. 
I think its a very good program
27/12/23, 12:13 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 807 1310: My family feels like education abroad is much more reliable.
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
27/12/23, 12:15 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
27/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 78 807 1310: And Olevel and Alevel certificates
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Kunal: Indeed
*When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
27/12/23, 12:18 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Ok thank you Sir
27/12/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I understand that. <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 12:22 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I get it sure
27/12/23, 12:28 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
27/12/23, 12:28 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
27/12/23, 12:28 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.* <This message was edited>
27/12/23, 12:46 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed, please?
27/12/23, 1:31 pm - Kunal: Please excuse me for some time as I am heading for my lunch. Let us connect at 2:30 pm CAT for the next part of our session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule. 

Meanwhile, you can go through our Social Media pages to learn more about the experiences of Edoofians and the program!

27/12/23, 2:44 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon
Shall we proceed?
27/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Yes yes Sir
27/12/23, 2:52 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Good afternoon
27/12/23, 2:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Number 2
27/12/23, 2:57 pm - Kunal: Well,
We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1: Connect with a counsellor- As your counsellor, now we are going through the counselling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test.

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
27/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Yes sir
27/12/23, 2:57 pm - Kunal: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
27/12/23, 2:58 pm - Kunal: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment,you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process.
27/12/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Yes,yes I understand Sir
27/12/23, 3:26 pm - Kunal: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

Congratulations on clearing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program I hope you have learned about the program better through the previous sessions. Now, I will guide you to the most important *Eligibility check stage* after addressing your questions. 

Are you ready for the same?
28/12/23, 10:43 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Sorry sir my network was unavailable today.
29/12/23, 8:10 am - Kunal: Good morning, Mr Mushamba
How are you doing?
29/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 807 1310: I'm sorry Sir we had a family discussion and my parents said they don't have the money yet.
29/12/23, 11:13 am - Kunal: I understand
May I know which financial aspects seems unaffordable to them, Sharon?
29/12/23, 11:14 am - +263 78 807 1310: The one of paying $200USD in 7 days.
29/12/23, 11:18 am - Kunal: Alright
Can you tell me why do they think it is not affordable to them?
29/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 807 1310: Because they don't earn much
With that money I have siblings too
29/12/23, 12:34 pm - Kunal: I understand, Sharon
So how are you planning to proceed with your Higher education?
29/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Thank you sir
29/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I think I'll just go to a University here in Zimbabwe where there are not much expenses and all
29/12/23, 2:01 pm - Kunal: May I know as per your knowledge what is the annual expense while studying in Zimbabwe including the cost of education, accommodation and other basic necessities?
29/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 807 1310: It's $450 per Semester meaning it's $900 per year
The $500 for the remaining basic necessities
Which means $1400 per year
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you Sharon
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - Kunal: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
29/12/23, 2:38 pm - Kunal: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?
29/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 807 1310: I am Sir
I really am
29/12/23, 4:16 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *10:00 am CAT Tuesday (02/01/24) to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness are important parameters of evaluation. 

*Wishing you and your family a joyous and Happy New Year!🌟*

Stay Blessed!
29/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Thank you sir
02/01/24, 10:41 am - Kunal: Good morning, everyone
I hope you are having a wonderful day

I am here to begin with the session, shall we proceed?
02/01/24, 4:21 pm - +263 78 807 1310: Sir I think I told you my problem.
I can't proceed.
