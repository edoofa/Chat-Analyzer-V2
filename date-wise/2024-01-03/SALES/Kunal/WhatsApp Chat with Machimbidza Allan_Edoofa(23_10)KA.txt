*"Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it." — Charles R. Swindoll*

Are you ready?
25/10/23, 3:43 pm - +263 78 814 4947: I am ready
25/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: It is good to hear from you
25/10/23, 3:43 pm - Kunal: As per the protocols of the program,the representation of your parents/guardians who will be supporting your education is necessary in the group so that they can follow the sessions and I can address their thoughts and queries directly. As you know higher education is a big decision that requires the support of your family. *So shall we add them to the group?*

In case they are not available right now, they can still be the part of a group and catch up with the conversations later
25/10/23, 3:44 pm - +263 78 814 4947: As for now they aren't available but l promise later
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - Kunal: Well
I would suggest that you can still add your family members because they can go through our conversations once available and it would help them understand the different aspects of the program. It would be easier to explain to them and to address their thoughts
Is that fine?
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 814 4947: Of course fine
25/10/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 814 4947: Make me an admin

30/10/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 814 4947: I have no experience yet . theory is what in my mind

30/10/23, 7:19 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
30/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 78 814 4947: Ok thank you
30/10/23, 7:23 pm - Kunal: Since you are interested in the Medical field, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
30/10/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 814 4947: Ohh I hear you ..according to my research ..the most important subject they considered was chemistry ..then maths as a must ..and we were allowed to choose between bio and physics as a third alternative
30/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kunal: I do understand, Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
30/10/23, 7:27 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

30/10/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 814 4947: Physiotherapy
30/10/23, 7:29 pm - Kunal: *Physiotherapy* is a branch of healthcare that applies modes of physical movement such as exercise, massage, besides education, advice, and counselling services to circumstances where movement and function are threatened by ageing, pain, injury, diseases, disorders, conditions, or other environmental factors.
