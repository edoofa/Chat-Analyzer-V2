I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

Let me help you with the eligibility consideration for Malawi

1 = distinction, 2 = distinction, 3 = credit, 4 = credit, 5 = credit, 6 = credit, 7 = pass, 8 = pass, 9 = fail

Now,we accept upto 7=pass for a subject
Let us say a student has 5 subjects and scored 7 in all of them creating an aggregrate of 35,this would be the maxumum limit for eligibility.All students scoring an aggregate within this range would meet the academic requirement for the program
02/01/24, 1:28 pm - Kunal: The minimum requirement was higher pre pandemic but during the pandemic a lot of students failed to recieve enough resources and Educational support which we had shared with the Universities and Ministries due to which the requirements has been lowered but I always encourage my students to target for maximum to increase the chances of Higher Quantum of Scholarship!

I believe you are confident about meeting the requirements and perform well in MSCE!
02/01/24, 2:20 pm - +265 889 89 23 61: At MSCE I get 26 points that is to say: Biology 4, Agriculture 5, English 6, Chichewa 4, Physics 7
02/01/24, 3:02 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that
