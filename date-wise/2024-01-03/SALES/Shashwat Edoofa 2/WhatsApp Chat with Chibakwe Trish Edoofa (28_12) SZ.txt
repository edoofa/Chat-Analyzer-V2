This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship.

02/01/24, 11:43 am - +263 78 910 8942: Alright
02/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 12:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
02/01/24, 12:55 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I'm around
02/01/24, 12:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Trish. I must say that you have obtained impeccable grades! You mentioned your affinity towards the healthcare sector. Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?
02/01/24, 1:24 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I can confidently say that it had been my dream since I was in grade one to become a doctor then came form 2 when I wanted to base with computers but whenever I tried to attempt codes I had this kind of rejection which I felt inside....then I met this wise old lady who told me that I belong to the medical field.....& whenever I tried to imagine myself in ten years time as a doctor I felt happy & also I felt a sense of belonging
02/01/24, 1:30 pm - +263 78 910 8942: About choosing area of specialisation....after a careful scrutiny into the medical field, the neuro department nerds more people....because it doesn't due to its complexity & I also felt the need to reach out to those little kids with neurological disorders because they have the potential to change the world to a better place therefore we need to make sure that their medical needs are met & also the department is better paying therefore I can fulfil my dreams
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India, he/she has to crack the entrance exam, NEET, which selects only a limited number of students from a vast pool of applicants. NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) is challenging due to its comprehensive syllabus, fierce competition, and the need to excel in biology, physics, and chemistry, making it a demanding examination for aspiring medical students.
02/01/24, 2:06 pm - +263 78 910 8942: Do I have to pay for this entrance exam
02/01/24, 2:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Trish. This is an extremely competitive exam. Furthermore, you need to have to have a student visa to give the exam, please.
02/01/24, 2:31 pm - +263 78 910 8942: I believe can take it. Student visa what is it for
02/01/24, 3:07 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Trish. I would like to inform you that in order to travel to India for the exam, you will need a student visa. Obtaining this visa typically requires enrolling in a university or educational institution in India. Therefore, pursuing a course of study in India is a prerequisite for traveling to the country to take the exam.
02/01/24, 3:12 pm - +263 78 910 8942: So what should I do now
02/01/24, 3:18 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Trish. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
02/01/24, 3:30 pm - +263 78 910 8942: Yeah sure
02/01/24, 3:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: The courses that she/he could pursue which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of Science in Optometry*

9. *Bachelor of Pharmacy*

After going through the entire list, may I know which course are you intrigued by so that I can brief you about the same?
