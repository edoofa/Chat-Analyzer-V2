02/01/24, 11:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
02/01/24, 11:27 am - +263 77 432 3058: So if you do not have Physics you won't study Medical Sciences
02/01/24, 11:30 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ethina. Since the Medical Industry is humongous, there are a plethora of courses that are extremely intrinsic for the Medical Industry to function, and you will be glad to know that they align with your A-level subjects as well! Shall I brief you regarding the courses?
02/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 77 432 3058: Yes yes you can

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

02/01/24, 3:13 pm - +263 77 432 3058: Wow it is a nice career I would love to do
02/01/24, 3:14 pm - +263 77 432 3058: So how many points do you expect from a student inorder to study this degree
02/01/24, 3:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
02/01/24, 3:21 pm - +263 77 432 3058: I'm confident I will not get less than 10 points , I will try to be more serious and hardworking
02/01/24, 3:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I have confidence that you will ace your exams with flying colours!
02/01/24, 3:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So does the course align with your career aspirations?
