In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
02/01/24, 1:47 pm - +263 77 774 8327: Ok sir
02/01/24, 1:49 pm - Garima Edoofa: Shall I brief you about the course in depth?
