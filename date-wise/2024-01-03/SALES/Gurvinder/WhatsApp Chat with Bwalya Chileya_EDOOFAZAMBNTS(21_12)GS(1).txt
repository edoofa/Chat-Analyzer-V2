21/12/23, 11:04 am - +260 95 5504753: Sir you said where having interviews around 09:30 ,so are the interviews still on or not because I can see time is running out.
21/12/23, 12:32 pm - Gurvinder: Excuse me, I was in a board meeting.
21/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: That is correct.
21/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Shall I brief you more about the program?
21/12/23, 12:37 pm - +260 96 4676711: Yes please
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*

21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/12/23, 1:31 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/12/23, 3:46 pm - +260 95 5504753: Yes indeed
21/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Bwalya, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/12/23, 4:05 pm - +260 95 5504753: Yes I surely know and believe that I am the right person to be chosen for this scholarship.

1•my highest educational level so far at the moment is grade twelve.
2•The course I would surely love to study is rhumatology that is specialized in the medical category of bones this field has surely shown me alot in how it can help many people because I too am a patient who suffers from a chronic condition that involves the bones and in my country there aren't many doctors who deal in this field so I personally would love to add up the number of rhumatologist in Zambia and at least help make a change for my people as well as inspire them no matter the circumstances or illness no nothing and no one will ever stop you from achieving your goals.
3•well my parents are well qualified and educated people for starters my mum is and entrepreneur she deals in different fields of business and my dad is well respected manager of lumwana mine's in solwezi.
4•on that part I am not too sure but I know that they are well educated people.
5•both of my parents have been supportive all the way through my education.
6•on the category on who who will be supporting me abroad it will depend on how the percentage of the scholarship will be but am sure both my parents will as always.
7•I have siblings and they are really young one is three years old and the other is a month old, and the others are employers and the other is still in university.
8•I study at ndola trust school and I am located in the copperbelt province and my per term fee was going about the range of above k7000 because they increase the fee every term.
   I HOPE THIS INFORMATION HAS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL TO YOU PLEASE UPDATE ME AS SOON AS YOU ARE FREE THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME YOUR TIME .
               YOURS TRUELY BWALYA CHILEYA. <This message was edited>
