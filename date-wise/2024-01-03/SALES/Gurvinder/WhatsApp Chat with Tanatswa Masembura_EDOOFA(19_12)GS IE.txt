“You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem and smarter than you think.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
21/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 77 402 0424: Morning
21/12/23, 10:29 am - Gurvinder: So is Tanatswa available for the session?

21/12/23, 12:46 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Caroline, also do tell me whether you learnt about Caroline’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
21/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 402 0424: I didn't co-op up with the program
21/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Due to network problem
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes it is
21/12/23, 2:34 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mrs Ruzvidzo, as we start your son's counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
21/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: Now Mrs Ruzvidzo, I would like to know Tanatswa better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about him, his career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. His highest education level?
2. The course He would like to study?
3. What do you parents do?
4. What is his parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting him for his Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting him financially for his higher education abroad?
7. Does he have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school does he study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way

*B. Plan or Bachelor of Planning*
27/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you so much now how are we going to proceed
27/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
27/12/23, 3:00 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
27/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l am
27/12/23, 3:04 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
27/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
27/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: *B. Plan or Bachelor of Planning* is four years long full-time professional degree course in planning for aspirants who wish to become planning professionals.
27/12/23, 3:08 pm - Gurvinder: *Why Study B Planning ?*

This course is the first step for a student who wishes to pursue a career in urban planning and development. This course of study is in high demand. In recent times, where the whole world is shifting towards strategies and planning of a sustainable environment while the cities are suffering from poorly executed planning, demands in intervention in planning smart cities, solar empowered settlements, constructions with the eco-friendly and green effect is increasing by each passing day.

28/12/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 402 0424: To begin with most children face challenges of resources so providing resources to underprivileged children in rural areas and supporting their studies would be of help in addition to that creating small scale asscociations to provide help in funds would also be of help since most children face monetary challenges
28/12/23, 11:48 am - Gurvinder: I appreciate Tanatswa's sense of hardworking for your community, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?

28/12/23, 12:25 pm - Gurvinder: Do you think in order to improve the education system and facilities in your community, Tanatswa needs to become a respected figure in the country first? And for that, do you believe studying with full dedication in a supportive environment is crucial?
28/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Even if he is not a respected person he has the ability to help the community also it's true because every study needs support so it is crucial
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
28/12/23, 12:45 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
28/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes why does it recommend India
28/12/23, 1:08 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

28/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: So now Mrs Ruzvidzo, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
28/12/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes as of Tanatswa is he going to have an access to  this education
28/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
28/12/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 402 0424: I can not afford
28/12/23, 4:15 pm - Gurvinder: Can you please elaborate, what do you mean?
28/12/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 402 0424: I am working as a village worker so l earn very little  so for me to pay complete fees will be difficulty since his young sister is still at school doing form 2
28/12/23, 4:27 pm - +263 77 402 0424: That is the reason why he was chosen to be paid by beam
28/12/23, 8:28 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
28/12/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Amen
29/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“The best way to predict your future is to create it."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
29/12/23, 8:22 am - +263 77 402 0424: Morning
29/12/23, 9:01 am - Gurvinder: Please, let me continue and after that you can decide if you can afford or not.
29/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
29/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
29/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
29/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
29/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:57 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

*after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
29/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 402 0424: Waaa what a great opportunity it is affordable
29/12/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
29/12/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
29/12/23, 10:24 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Ruzvidzo, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
29/12/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
29/12/23, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
29/12/23, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
29/12/23, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

29/12/23, 11:44 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit Tanatswa?*
29/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes they will
29/12/23, 1:05 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Mrs Ruzvidzo, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
29/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you so much in advance GOD BLESS YOU
29/12/23, 1:10 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

29/12/23, 1:11 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
29/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l do
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Ruzvidzo, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
29/12/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes it is
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Financially or with skills
29/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
29/12/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes we do
29/12/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
29/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
29/12/23, 1:44 pm - Gurvinder: Mrs Ruzvidzo as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
29/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 77 402 0424: When the cost is $300   he is going to spend $900 and when it cost $450  he is going to spend $1350
29/12/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: Please, I am asking for 5, and not 3
29/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 402 0424: When it's $300 for 5 universities it's $1500 and for $450  it will be $2250
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly Mrs Ruzvidzo, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
29/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
29/12/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
29/12/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes
29/12/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 402 0424: I am sorry I was in the meeting end of month for village health workers
29/12/23, 8:57 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
02/01/24, 9:22 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"The magic in new beginnings is truly the most powerful of them all."*

*Happy New Year to you and your family.*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
02/01/24, 9:27 am - +263 77 402 0424: Morning happy happy
02/01/24, 10:00 am - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
02/01/24, 10:08 am - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l do
02/01/24, 10:09 am - +263 77 402 0424: May  l ask what is the meaning of the word SOPs
02/01/24, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Please, that means Statement of Purpose.
02/01/24, 10:16 am - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you
02/01/24, 10:19 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
02/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Mrs Ruzvidzo basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
02/01/24, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
02/01/24, 11:09 am - +263 77 402 0424: Thank you well understood
02/01/24, 11:57 am - Gurvinder: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.

Are you familiar with the Edoofa Cycle?
02/01/24, 12:09 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l am
02/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Mrs Ruzvidzo, as you can see, we are currently at Step 1. After this step, you will proceed to Step 2. If you successfully pass Step 2, you will receive your Acceptance Letter from the Edoofa Academic Board in Step 3. After that, as shown in the image above, the completion of your Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4.

Upon completing your formalities, in Step 5: we will initiate your Edoofa Admission Process and your Earn While You Learn Program. We will assign your complete application to our Admission Officers and the Head Coach of the Earn While You Learn Program.

The Admission Officers will be responsible for assisting you with all the required admission documentation that we discussed earlier, including the Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendation, and the completion of applications in all of Edoofa’s Associated Universities, etc.

The Head Coach will be responsible for assigning your application to the Earn While You Learn Program Mentor, who will then evaluate your candidature and assist with projects and assignments throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program.
02/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: As an organization that has positively impacted the lives of tens of thousands of African students, we understand that over 97% of parents face financial challenges when planning for their child’s tertiary education. In fact, it is one of the most prominent fears because of which there are parents who despite understanding the kind of growth their child would get through international education, still opt for their children to study in their home country.

Now in our quest to overcome this challenge, I would like to inform you that in Stage 5, while our Admission officers assist with all the necessary admission-related documentation, Edoofa’s Financial Planning team will connect with your parents to help them plan finances for your higher education.

Since in the majority of African nations inflation is a real challenge, keeping in mind that the cost of living in your home country increases atleast by 20% year on year, Financial Planning officers will be responsible for helping your parents plan for your tertiary education in a way that ensures they are not burdened financially throughout your education. Financial planning would include the following aspects:-
*Budgeting for your higher education, as per your parent's affordability.*
*Supporting your parents in building your tertiary education fund.*
02/01/24, 12:14 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you now have an in-depth understanding of what happens in Stage 5 of your Edoofa Cycle?
02/01/24, 12:19 pm - +263 77 402 0424: Yes l do
02/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: In Step 6: Once the Financial Planning Team assists your parents in budgeting for your higher education, moving forward you will receive offer letters from the universities where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to complete the required registration process,  as well as finalizing the University. *In order to reserve your seat in any particular University chosen by you a registration fee would have to be paid which would be adjusted through your budgeting done in Stage 5 of the Edoofa Cycle.*

*NOTE:- The registration fee adjusted is not an additional cost, rather it is a part of your first year’s annual fee*
02/01/24, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks of your registration process, you will be given your Final Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL), which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

02/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
02/01/24, 1:13 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
