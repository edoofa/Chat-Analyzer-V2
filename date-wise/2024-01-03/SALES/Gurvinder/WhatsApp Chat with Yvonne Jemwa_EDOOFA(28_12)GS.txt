*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
28/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder added +263 77 865 4463
28/12/23, 1:42 pm - +263 77 865 4463: Yes you at the right place
28/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Yvonne,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
28/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 865 4463: It's  my pleasure knowing you sir
28/12/23, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Yvonne, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tinotenda, is that correct?
28/12/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 865 4463: Yes
28/12/23, 2:05 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Tinotenda, also do tell me whether you learnt about Tinotenda’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
28/12/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 865 4463: I don't know much about Tinotenda but you can take me through the process  if possible
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let me brief you about the program first.
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
28/12/23, 2:41 pm - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
28/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 865 4463: Yes that's true
28/12/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 865 4463: But I'm looking  for Masters scholarship
28/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
28/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Yvonne, as we start your counselling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
28/12/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 865 4463: I think I can manage
28/12/23, 3:09 pm - Gurvinder: Now Yvonne, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which University do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in Bachelors?

Please elaborate on your answers and answer them in points, so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way <This message was edited>
28/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 865 4463: I'm Yvonne Jemwa,aged 24 years. I'm currently studying  a Bachelor of Science Honors Degree in Supply Chain Management  in my final year.I would like to study  a Masters degree in Procurement. My parents are farmers . Standard two.My siblings and my parents were of full support. My siblings and my parents may be of assistant. I have 6 siblings they are self employed mostly  doing poultry projects.  I study at Chinhoyi University of Technology  which is located  in Mashonaland West  Province  in Zimbabwe and we pay USD$480 per term.
28/12/23, 3:28 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study Procurement, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
28/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 865 4463: Because I'm good at negotiation
28/12/23, 3:43 pm - Gurvinder: Can you elaborate, when you say negotiation, I would like to know more about negotiation in which term, since negotiation is a skill that is widely required in majority of the fields, therefore why only procurement?
28/12/23, 3:47 pm - +263 77 865 4463: Procurement ensures that all items and services are properly acquired so that projects and processes can proceed efficiently and successfully. It's my duty to make sure that I meet all the rights like right price so it's my duty to have better negotiation  skills in order to meet  all the rights needed when acquiring goods and services
28/12/23, 8:44 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.
