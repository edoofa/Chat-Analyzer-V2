It helps students from Africa  to acquire 
quality International Education
At low/affordable prices
It also helps with Carrier counseling for the student   ,, 
Students will do projects  that help in  career and skill development
29/12/23, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Well received, Lewin, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/12/23, 10:22 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

29/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 78 068 3352: No i didn't
29/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: May I know the reason behind the same, Lewin?
29/12/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 068 3352: They liked the idea that i should have a scholarship,,
So i applied to many  some months back and  there was no response and my parents started to doubt about  online scholarships    ,, so this Edoofa was the first to respond
29/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: I do understand,

However what is your understanding of the financial aspect of the scholarship, Lewin?
29/12/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 068 3352: I have not yet heard about it
29/12/23, 2:18 pm - Harmehak: What is your understanding, Lewin?

29/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
29/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in, Lewin?
29/12/23, 2:43 pm - +263 78 068 3352: I don't know...
29/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: Let me share a document with you for your better clarity first, Lewin
29/12/23, 2:50 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
29/12/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 167 7968: So do they support u financially
29/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 167 7968: Do they want u to do your studies abroad
29/12/23, 3:04 pm - +263 78 068 3352: Yes
29/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 167 7968: The best after obtaing Alevl results
29/12/23, 3:10 pm - +263 77 167 7968: Do schools abroad have your science subjects which u ar studying now,do u have any friend who is also stdng thru this organisatn where is he right now
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 068 3352: I have read the pdf
 But i failed to understand how to answer this
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:

1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.

Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself. 

This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.

2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels. 

3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
29/12/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: It's a 21 page long document, Lewin.
29/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through this video, Mr Herbet?
