You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
29/12/23, 12:43 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship.

The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa.

02/01/24, 10:12 am - +263 78 697 8729: 1. Edoofa is an Educational program which forcuses on quality higher education.Edoofa Scholarship Program is an well known appriciated in SAARC nations and in Africa offering 50-100% scholarships on tution fees.Edoofa have worked with 250 universities and colleges in India.Edoofa can help you if u want to study in other countries like Canada or Germeny .Edoofa assist students with VISA application processes.Edoofa did not offer a full Scholarship but after help of scholarship fund the fees come down to $ 2000/$3000.

2.Edoofa did not offer a full Scolarship no matter your passes or poor you are.
They just reduce the fees after their Sclolarship fund to $2000/$3000 per year.
 3.My family members are willing to support
02/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: I am glad you thoroughly followed the document, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:21 am - Harmehak: Did you discuss the same with your parents too?
02/01/24, 10:22 am - +263 78 697 8729: I am so grateful
02/01/24, 10:24 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i did and they appreciated
02/01/24, 10:31 am - Harmehak: I am glad, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: I believe you do understand the following, Liberty.
02/01/24, 10:32 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
02/01/24, 10:34 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes i do but there are few things i don't understand
02/01/24, 10:35 am - +263 78 697 8729: This message was deleted
02/01/24, 10:37 am - +263 78 697 8729: Is Edoofa going to pay my fare
02/01/24, 10:42 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
02/01/24, 10:44 am - +263 78 697 8729: Who is going to buy my plane ticket
02/01/24, 10:48 am - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.
So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2024, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2024. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2024, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.
As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa.
The cost for both the visa and flight cost will be around $350-$450, But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August next year as per your preparations
02/01/24, 10:53 am - +263 78 697 8729: Ok Ms Harmehak thank you and now i understand
02/01/24, 10:56 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome,

Is there any thing else that you would like to ask?
02/01/24, 10:58 am - +263 78 697 8729: Yes, The actual fee after scholarship fund is not known?
02/01/24, 10:59 am - +263 78 697 8729: Can i study Law with 9 A levels ?
02/01/24, 11:07 am - Harmehak: The fee is between $2000-3000 itself.

However the final fee is shared by the university when you will receive acceptance letter.
02/01/24, 11:21 am - +263 78 697 8729: Ok and it will be payed annually or per semester
02/01/24, 11:25 am - Harmehak: Now you see Liberty, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid in semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.

So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
02/01/24, 11:30 am - +263 78 697 8729: Okay okay yah so it is affordable
02/01/24, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
02/01/24, 11:51 am - +263 78 697 8729: My parents are farmers and my sister do teaching
02/01/24, 11:55 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
02/01/24, 11:56 am - Harmehak: Earlier you shared with me the financial challenges, I hope everything is clear now and you thoroughly discussed the finances with your family?
02/01/24, 11:56 am - +263 78 697 8729: With 9 points can i study Law
02/01/24, 11:57 am - Harmehak: Yes please
