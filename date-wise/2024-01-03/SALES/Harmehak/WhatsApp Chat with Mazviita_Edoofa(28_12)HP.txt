Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe.

02/01/24, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Well Mazviita now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
02/01/24, 12:17 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I think its a life changing decision since l will be able to develop new skills and perspectives and also other cultures and lifelong connections. I can also be able to start a new life in that country.
02/01/24, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Very correct and in that case would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Mazviita?
02/01/24, 12:48 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I am fully prepared to go study abroad because l have done my research on the host country and culture.
02/01/24, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Mazviita, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
02/01/24, 1:41 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I have discussed with them and they would love to see me study abroad and support me but they do not have the finance to assist me.
02/01/24, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding the financial aspect, Mazviita?
02/01/24, 3:32 pm - +263 77 615 7802: Well my family won't be able to help me budget for tuition, housing,food and transportation costs and the cost of living abroad.
02/01/24, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: While I understand,

May I know how are you planning your higher education?
02/01/24, 4:47 pm - +263 77 615 7802: For now l am planning to do Business Management but if l don't have finance l might have to wait until my family can afford to pay for my fees for University
02/01/24, 5:02 pm - Harmehak: I do understand Mazviita.

So what is your understanding of the financial aspect of the scholarship?
02/01/24, 5:06 pm - +263 77 615 7802: I understood that you can provide fully funded scholarship
02/01/24, 6:16 pm - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
02/01/24, 9:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
