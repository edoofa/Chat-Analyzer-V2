23/12/23, 10:25 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yes and it is very difficult for them to pay the fees due to price changes every day

23/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 73 398 2320: In addition in India I believe that there is economic stability and the fees are a bit lower than in this country
23/12/23, 10:33 am - +27 84 052 0038: I will manage, I know with the little I am getting I will sacrifice for a better future of my child and I believe in India the economy is stable as compared to Zimbabwe so I can manage.

23/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 73 398 2320: OK I'm on it
23/12/23, 11:31 am - Tushti: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
23/12/23, 11:31 am - +263 73 398 2320: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 11:31 am - Tushti: Once you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
23/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 73 398 2320: After achieving this degree, it will help me to be employed as soon as possible as it covers many commercial areas. If I'm provided with this career I will be able to take care of my family and to change the background also and also achieving this will make my parents proud of me. I will be able to take care of my siblings too. Endoofa can make me achieve my dreams buy offering me a scholarship and I will be greaful to that
23/12/23, 11:46 am - Tushti: That is really great Tafadzwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

23/12/23, 11:50 am - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 73 398 2320: There are Better educational facilities in india and access to Internet for my assignments and also stable economy in India moreover India has a good reputation on educational institutions
23/12/23, 11:57 am - Tushti: That is correct

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
26/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 73 398 2320: Morning sir Tushti I'm sorry today I'm not going to be available my mother was involved in a car accident so we will do our session tomorrow
26/12/23, 10:34 am - +27 84 052 0038: Good morning Mr Tushti I think we can start but Tafadzwa is in hospital my wife was involved in an fatal accident this morning so he is there to monitor the situation

26/12/23, 10:41 am - +27 84 052 0038: I hope so
26/12/23, 10:42 am - Tushti: Mr Chirembwe do you wish to continue the session with me?
26/12/23, 10:42 am - +27 84 052 0038: Yes
26/12/23, 10:43 am - Tushti: What are your thoughts on India?
26/12/23, 10:44 am - +263 73 398 2320: Thank you
26/12/23, 10:44 am - +27 84 052 0038: I think India is one of the great nation in the globe in terms of economic stability and security
26/12/23, 10:45 am - Tushti: I hope you have gone through this?
26/12/23, 10:47 am - +27 84 052 0038: Yes I did
26/12/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
26/12/23, 10:56 am - +27 84 052 0038: No we are not familiar with it but it's an eye opener for us.
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
26/12/23, 11:10 am - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
26/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
26/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
26/12/23, 11:11 am - Tushti: In simple wordswhat we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
26/12/23, 11:22 am - +27 84 052 0038: Ok thank it's understandable
26/12/23, 11:22 am - +27 84 052 0038: You***
26/12/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: Now, let me brief you about the EWYL Program
26/12/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
26/12/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
26/12/23, 1:34 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

26/12/23, 1:35 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
27/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea we may start

27/12/23, 9:25 am - +263 73 398 2320: She's feeling better today
27/12/23, 9:26 am - Tushti: I am pleased to hear that
27/12/23, 9:26 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea.... Thank you
27/12/23, 9:26 am - Tushti: Does she have serious injuries?
27/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 73 398 2320: No the doctor said there are no serious injuries
27/12/23, 9:27 am - Tushti: Thank God!
27/12/23, 9:27 am - Tushti: So, are you ready to resume the session?
27/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 73 398 2320: Today I'm ready
27/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Excellent
27/12/23, 9:28 am - Tushti: Did you understand the EWYL Program?
27/12/23, 9:28 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea I do remember
27/12/23, 9:29 am - Tushti: Can you tell me how it might benefit you?
27/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 73 398 2320: The EWYL program it will benefit me in the sense that I will be able to develop new skills at the same time I will be earning something so this program is very beneficial to me to a greater extent
27/12/23, 9:32 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that *you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.*

Are you ready?
27/12/23, 9:33 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea I am ready
27/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 73 398 2320: But let me call my parent to be online
27/12/23, 9:35 am - Tushti: Noted
27/12/23, 9:35 am - Tushti: Let me know when you are ready
27/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 73 398 2320: Okay
27/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 73 398 2320: He is online I think we're ready
27/12/23, 9:44 am - +27 84 052 0038: Good morning everyone
27/12/23, 9:49 am - Tushti: Now, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 73 398 2320: So where do we apply and also what is the cost of applying 2 or more universities
27/12/23, 9:52 am - Tushti: I shall explain that further
27/12/23, 9:53 am - Tushti: Kindly calculate the answer first
27/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 73 398 2320: Alright
27/12/23, 9:53 am - +263 73 398 2320: Oky
27/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 73 398 2320: 1500 to 2250
27/12/23, 10:03 am - Tushti: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/12/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
27/12/23, 10:04 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
27/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 73 398 2320: Okay I do understand thank u
27/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea I do
27/12/23, 10:07 am - +263 73 398 2320: So we have to apply on the 31st of January
27/12/23, 10:07 am - Tushti: I shall explain
27/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 73 398 2320: OK sir
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: Tafdzwa basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
27/12/23, 10:08 am - Tushti: Are you able to understand?
27/12/23, 10:12 am - +263 73 398 2320: Yea I'm able to understand
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: Basically, this registration fee of $500-1000 will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024- 2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/12/23, 10:17 am - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
27/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 73 398 2320: So far l have no question
27/12/23, 10:21 am - Tushti: Does your parent have any question?
27/12/23, 10:23 am - +27 84 052 0038: No question so far
27/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 73 398 2320: There are no questions
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
27/12/23, 10:24 am - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

The issue of food insecurity and poor nutrition is a complex and multifaceted problem that affects millions of people in Africa. One of the contributing factors to this issue is the state of agriculture on the continent. Many smallholder farmers in Africa are confronted with outdated farming techniques, a lack of access to modern technologies, and limited resources, such as fertile land and adequate irrigation systems.
As a result, agricultural yields in many parts of Africa are low, leading to food shortages and malnutrition. The lack of access to diverse and nutritious food sources is particularly detrimental to children, pregnant women, and other vulnerable groups.
Additionally, the impact of climate change has further strained the agricultural sector in Africa, making it even more challenging for farmers to produce enough food to meet the demands of their communities.
In conclusion, while it is true that many Africans suffer from food insecurity and poor nutrition due to inadequate agricultural practices, it is important to recognize that this problem is not solely caused by farmers. It is a complex issue that requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach that includes investment in modern agricultural technologies, improved access to education and training, and increased support for smallholder farmers."

Section 6

"I used to believe that life was a series of impossible challenges. Like a puzzle with no solution, I struggled to see the bigger picture and understand my purpose. But one day, I decided to take a different approach.
I began to look at each obstacle as an opportunity for growth and learning. I started to focus on the journey, rather than the destination. Every experience, good or bad, became a stepping stone to a better version of myself.
As I embraced this new mindset, I found that my struggles became my greatest teachers. I learned to be resilient, to adapt and to find strength in adversity.
Today, I stand before you, not as someone who has overcome all obstacles, but as someone who has learned to embrace them. I have discovered that life is not about reaching a final destination, but about growing and evolving.
So I encourage you to embrace your own journey, and to see each challenge as an opportunity for growth. Remember, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey."
