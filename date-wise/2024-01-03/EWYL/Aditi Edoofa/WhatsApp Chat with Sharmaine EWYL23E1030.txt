So are you ready for today's session?
26/12/23, 11:11 AM - Aditi Edoofa: @263774839519 May I know the reason for your absence in today's session?
26/12/23, 5:35 PM - +263 77 483 9519: Good afternoon ma'am
26/12/23, 5:37 PM - +263 77 483 9519: I'm deeply sorry for missing the session today.
The reason is there was no electricity and I couldn't charge my phone so my battery was flat
27/12/23, 8:30 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Happy Wednesday!
Hope you are well.

So let's dive into our session🚀
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, I understand but please make sure that you conserve your device's battery for our sessions.
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Yes ma'am
27/12/23, 8:31 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Good morning madam
27/12/23, 8:36 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/12/23, 8:37 AM - Aditi Edoofa: So can you tell me the two objectives that you understood?
27/12/23, 8:57 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Getting to know my EWYL team
27/12/23, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
27/12/23, 8:58 AM - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
27/12/23, 8:59 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Okay I understand
27/12/23, 8:59 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/12/23, 9:01 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Okay ma'am
27/12/23, 9:03 AM - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/12/23, 9:05 AM - +263 77 483 9519: Totally interesting
27/12/23, 9:07 AM - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
