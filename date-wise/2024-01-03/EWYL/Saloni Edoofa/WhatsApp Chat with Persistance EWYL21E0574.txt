29/12/23, 4:21 PM - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

You know when I was a student and till now, I make agendas on what I wish to achieve in life this year, and how I can transform it for the betterment of not just myself, but my family and the people around me. Honestly, some targets seemed achievable, but I always kept a few that made me thrive beyond my boundaries to achieve them.
I, as your wellwisher and companion, wish you that you also push yourself and make the most of the opportunities that are coming your way starting from the EWYL Program that offers you a chance to *stand on your own feet*. Next year, _we will be a few months away from our flight to India_✈️, and I want to see you living a journey till that time that is filled with *hard work and dedication*. I have personally curated this message from the bottom of my heart to wish you a very *Happy New Year, 2024* 🫶🏻

Ma'am, I have forms that I intend to share shortly. However, I wish to draw attention to the follow-up required for the forms of students that were previously shared , regrettably, some of these individuals have yet to be contacted. It would greatly benefit us if all the forms from the previous year were attended to promptly before commencing work on the new forms I currently have.
2/1/24, 10:45 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Sure Persistance, I would happily be able to assist you on the same.

Can you share with me the names of all the students along with their form sharing date?
2/1/24, 10:47 AM - +91 70879 73863: Ma'am there are a lot I think you just need to make a follow-up on the last three batches of forms I shared

Let me try to compile all the names these students
2/1/24, 10:56 AM - Saloni Edoofa: Sure, and share with me once that is done.
