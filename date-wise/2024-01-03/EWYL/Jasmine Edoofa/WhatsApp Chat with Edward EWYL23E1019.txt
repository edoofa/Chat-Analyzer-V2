23/12/23, 2:35 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/12/23, 3:07 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Thank you man
23/12/23, 3:26 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like to inform you that now we will be meeting on *Tuesday i.e. 26-Dec-2023 for your session from 1:30 pm - 3:30 pm* (African Time)

*Keeping your routine in mind, I've shifted our session timings for a more productive engagement.*
I would appreciate your acknowledgment of this message and confirmation of your understanding of the *new session timings*
23/12/23, 3:27 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
26/12/23, 1:39 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good afternoon, Edward,_*👋🏼
Before delving into your Christmas celebrations, I'd like to bring your attention to the session timings. 
Considering your hectic schedule, I've made some adjustments to our timetable.

*From now onwards, our sessions will take place from Monday to Friday, spanning from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*. Yes, we've extended the session to 2 hours for a more productive interaction. 

So are you excited about the session?
26/12/23, 1:58 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:00 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So before we start, I couldn't stop myself but ask, how was your Christmas? 🌲
26/12/23, 2:03 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Was very fyn and yours
26/12/23, 2:10 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great to know. You know this year, I spent a quiet and reflective time with my family, cherishing the festive spirit. We gathered for a festive meal, exchanged heartfelt gifts, and shared stories. 
The holiday season is a wonderful time to appreciate the warmth of family and friends
26/12/23, 2:29 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Wow wonderful
26/12/23, 2:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you, dear. Last time we discussed Project 3

Do you remember?
26/12/23, 2:40 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 2:41 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
26/12/23, 2:42 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yeah
26/12/23, 2:43 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head’s Contact.
Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head’s Contact.
26/12/23, 3:52 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I have it
26/12/23, 9:31 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: So now it is time to wrap up the session. It was lovely talking to you. 

*Now we will meet tomorrow from 1:30 pm to 3:30 pm*
I want you to inculcate the habit of joining the session on your own and just give a quick "I'm here" when you're online at 1:30 pm. 
Can I expect this from you?
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
26/12/23, 9:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.
Goodnight Edward

Do you remember?
28/12/23, 2:32 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Yes
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is crucial that you maintain regular communication with the student and address any queries they may have. Our counseling team will be reaching out to them directly within the next 15-20 days.
28/12/23, 2:33 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Once you get the headmaster’s number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.

The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?

28/12/23, 3:02 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 3:04 PM - +263 71 303 5080: It’s  school fees is 420
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: That will work, Edward
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them
28/12/23, 3:11 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok Mam

We want to build a habit of coming to the EWYL LINE every day and chanting the mantra.
28/12/23, 3:55 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok ok
28/12/23, 3:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day.

Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 2:44 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I would name it possland 
The principles of that country would be free education 
No corruption 
 And  it would  base a  foundation on the young
29/12/23, 2:45 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: "Posslаnd" is a creative and intriguing name for a utopian society, and the principles you've outlined—free education, no corruption, and a foundation based on the young—paint a vision of a society that values education, integrity, and youth empowerment.

29/12/23, 3:06 PM - +263 71 303 5080: I wanted to ask that how long does an offer letter take to come !?
29/12/23, 3:12 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Generally, it takes around 5-7 days to receive the letter from the University, however, as you are aware the Universities are on break now due to Christmas and New Year, so it might take a little longer. I, however, would encourage you to please connect with your Admission Officer and confirm the same, they will be able to give you the correct timeline.
29/12/23, 3:13 PM - +263 71 303 5080: Ok mam
29/12/23, 3:16 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉
