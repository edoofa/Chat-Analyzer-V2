2/1/24, 2:15 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Edoofa  students  here in Zimbabwe  we are many and by that I mean many students in various schools  now and the other thing I have noticed while doing this project is most schools in Zimbabwe including headmaster are very aware of this project  by now due to many edoofians in Zimbabwean the way I see it is we students are now telling these headmasters the same thing over and over again and I have seen that that's why I'm not making  any progress  I have messaged quite a number of headmasters to my surprise edoofa is now well known like in 2023 I created  my community as you said and guess what the people that managed  to join the group where edoofians also who where pretending like they want a scholarship meantime  waiting for the real people who needed scholarship  like through my efforts  my point is most of the well known schools are now aware  of edoofa and as well as the students it like here in Zimbabwe when u talk about edoofa its seems as if you are talking about nothing new as it is well known what am I supposed to do?

2/1/24, 2:22 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: I am delighted to share that EDOOFA's scholarship program is currently benefiting over 100 schools in Africa, with more than 3,000 African students already reaping its rewards. School principals and teachers who play a significant role in our program enjoy exclusive access to part-time Ph.D. programs. Additionally, EDOOFA's Earn While You Learn Program helps students reduce the financial burden of food and accommodation by providing opportunities to learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.
2/1/24, 2:25 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok

2/1/24, 2:30 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok

2/1/24, 2:43 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok
2/1/24, 2:47 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok
2/1/24, 2:50 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:

1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
2/1/24, 2:51 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Understood
2/1/24, 2:52 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Takudzwa- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
2/1/24, 2:54 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Understood
2/1/24, 2:55 PM - +263 78 412 2571: I got it all
2/1/24, 2:56 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:

FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on

2/1/24, 2:58 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Ok
2/1/24, 2:59 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
2/1/24, 3:01 PM - +263 78 412 2571: Understood
2/1/24, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
2/1/24, 3:09 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)

2/1/24, 3:14 PM - +263 78 412 2571: OK but why
2/1/24, 3:15 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
