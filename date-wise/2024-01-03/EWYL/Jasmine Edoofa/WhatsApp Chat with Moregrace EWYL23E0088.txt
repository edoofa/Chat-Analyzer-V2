28/12/23, 3:01 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
28/12/23, 3:03 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: The reason behind this is that there is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students form a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
28/12/23, 3:08 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: 1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

28/12/23, 3:11 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, Moregrace- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

28/12/23, 3:34 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok Ma'am
28/12/23, 3:34 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey

28/12/23, 4:11 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Ok
28/12/23, 8:32 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. It fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

29/12/23, 1:38 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Afternoon Moregrace*_
Let us start today's session with a fun question -

If you could create a new country on any unclaimed land in the world, what would you name it, and what values or principles would be the foundation of your utopian society?
29/12/23, 1:44 PM - +263 78 155 6299: That's a fun question! Let's imagine I could create a new country on some unclaimed land. I think I would name it "Solara," which means "sun" in Latin. The values and principles of this society would be based on sustainability, equality, and respect for nature. The society would be focused on living in harmony with the environment and ensuring that all people have access to the resources they need to live a fulfilling life. The people of Solara would value peace, cooperation, and collaboration. Does that sound like a place you'd like to live? 😊
29/12/23, 2:03 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Solara sounds like a wonderfully thought-out and inspiring utopian vision! The emphasis on sustainability, equality, and respect for nature reflects a deep awareness of the interconnectedness between society and the environment. It's particularly commendable that your vision prioritizes access to resources for all, promoting a sense of shared prosperity and well-being. Good job, Moregrace
29/12/23, 2:04 PM - +263 78 155 6299: Thank you
29/12/23, 2:36 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Have you messaged on the EWYL LINE?
29/12/23, 3:14 PM - Jasmine Edoofa: Now it is time to wrap up the session. As we are going to embark on a new chapter at the dawn of the New Year, I really wanted to send my warmest wishes your way. 
_May this coming year be filled with joy, laughter, and moments of profound happiness_ 🌈

Along with you, the Edoofa Family will also be occupied in *New Year Celebrations from tomorrow till 1 January 2024* and we will *resume from 2 January onwards*🎉

Wishing you a year ahead filled with love, prosperity, and the fulfillment of your heart's desires. May every day be a chance for you to shine and make a positive impact. ✨

Happy New Year in advance! 🎊
