Please excuse me for not being able to connect yesterday. We were celebrating Christmas in our office, and I was occupied with decorating the tree. It went really well!

We do not have our sessions over the weekend, so we can now connect on Tuesday. Monday is a holiday due to Christmas!

The current session has commenced, and it appears you're not on your EWYL line. Is it challenging to be present on time? I've noticed a recurring need for reminders. Could we discuss the reason behind this?
