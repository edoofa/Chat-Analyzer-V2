23/10/23, 12:32 pm - Kunal: Thank you for sharing them. 
I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
23/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Okay
23/10/23, 12:44 pm - Kunal: So, may I know with your interests towards Medicine, why didn't you opt for Physics at A level?
23/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Umm l thought biology will do too🥴
Okay l did physics at O level and l really loved to do it at A level🤦‍♀️ but l just felt l wouldn't have enough time to study since l am doing my A Level at a a day school and umm physics would require much attention
23/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kunal: I do understand , Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. There fore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in their A level mandatorily.
23/10/23, 1:05 pm - Kunal: Since you are not having Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine, but considering your interest and passion in the field there are courses from Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help you fulfil your dreams of working in this field

26/10/23, 4:46 pm - Kunal: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me, How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations from studying in India?
26/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Well l guess universities in India are well recognized and would make me eligible to anywhere l would want to work and l would just love to gain the skills there and when l am well equipped with the skills l prefer applying them back here in my own country
26/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Amazing!
As I can see, you have understood the quality of higher education  which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
26/10/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Noo l heard its a lot
26/10/23, 5:05 pm - Kunal: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

26/10/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 830 1340: This message was deleted
26/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Ohh sry it's clear so per semester l need approximately 1000 to 1500
26/10/23, 5:25 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Abt the family affording it l ain't sure unfortunately l can only conclude that when its time for me to go to varsity but l think 🤔it could be a bit difficult for them considering the traveling costs too
26/10/23, 5:44 pm - Kunal: I can understand, Praise
26/10/23, 5:46 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you that if you are looking forward to scholarship weightage, Medical Lab Technology and Physiotherapy lead with up to Higher quantum scholarship for qualified students which can reduce the cost of education to an affordable price.
26/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 830 1340: What amount actually
26/10/23, 6:08 pm - Kunal: In simple words what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. 

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.
26/10/23, 6:48 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Alright
26/10/23, 6:55 pm - Kunal: So, may I know if you wish me to explain Medical Lab Technology and Physiotherapy?
26/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Ohh l guess you did explain that earlier in the last session so l will get back and have a close look at that and see what l can do l am just in a state where l can't decide 🥹The changes are have made are just overwhelming and l need time to think abt whatever l am going to choose that is if you can allow to so that l don't regret anything and   l will be happy with my life profession
26/10/23, 7:08 pm - Kunal: That is fine
You can take your time and decide regarding the same and let me know once you are done
26/10/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Alright thank you
26/10/23, 9:31 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:00 pm CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!

27/10/23, 4:37 pm - Kunal: Good to hear that!
As we've thoroughly covered the course details can you tell me how you see yourself in 5 years after your course and If you are provided with this career option and how can being an Edoofian enable you to achieve your career goals?
27/10/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Ohh from what l understood about the explanation about the this l would really focus on adding the disabled so they can handle themselves and make them feel comfortable with the people surrounding them  hence in 5 years time l would probably have an institution that will cater for physiotherapy to cure to cure a range of disabilities and diseases
27/10/23, 4:54 pm - Kunal: I appreciate and admire your foresightedness at the same time 

However, as your concierge, I would like to share with you that the career path which you have chosen ahead, will require a lot of hard work and dedication.

27/10/23, 5:29 pm - +263 78 830 1340: India
27/10/23, 5:30 pm - Kunal: You are right!
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends *India* as a Higher Education Platform

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
27/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 78 830 1340: You already have told me it recognized globally

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
27/10/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Yeah
27/10/23, 7:11 pm - Kunal: Alright Praise
Since we have covered the cost of education
So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.
And do you know how that is done?
27/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 830 1340: No
27/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kunal: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the 

*Earn While You Learn Program*

The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kunal: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kunal: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kunal: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
27/10/23, 8:11 pm - Kunal: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
27/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kunal: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.


These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
27/10/23, 8:12 pm - Kunal: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
27/10/23, 8:55 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT Monday (30/10/23) to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameter of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

27/10/23, 8:59 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Okay thank you
30/10/23, 1:00 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon,

*“Each day comes bearing its gifts. Untie the ribbon.” —Ann Ruth Schabacker*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
30/10/23, 5:22 pm - +263 78 830 1340: 🤦‍♀️Sry again
30/10/23, 5:29 pm - Kunal: May I know why there is a delay?
30/10/23, 7:22 pm - +263 78 830 1340: l was at school so l heard switched off data
30/10/23, 8:37 pm - Kunal: Let us connect at *12:30 pm CAT Tomorrow to resume your session *(In case you have any challenges, please let me know the time you will be available, and we will schedule accordingly)*

Please note that your participation and activeness is an important parameters of evaluation. 

*In case the student is having lessons, the parents can also take part in the session*

Stay Blessed!
30/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Alright thank you
31/10/23, 12:48 pm - Kunal: Good Afternoon, everyone
How are you doing?
31/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 3:17 pm - Kunal: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it  depends upon his/her hard work.
However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
31/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Wooow 🤗
31/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 830 1340: My father
31/10/23, 3:34 pm - Kunal: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
31/10/23, 3:46 pm - +263 78 830 1340: I think they  are interested in that though...
31/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kunal: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at even a greater pace, as you will be transformed to a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family thereby yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle free life to your parents.
31/10/23, 3:46 pm - Kunal: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) Application Form 

2) Statement of Purpose which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) Letter of Recommendation from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university
31/10/23, 3:49 pm - +263 78 830 1340: This message was deleted
31/10/23, 3:50 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Passport
Visa
Education Qualifications that go inline with what one intends to study
31/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kunal: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not
31/10/23, 3:52 pm - Kunal: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
31/10/23, 3:53 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 4:05 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Alright
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kunal: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kunal: This enrollment fee includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
The Foster and Care throughout your course
31/10/23, 4:07 pm - Kunal: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
31/10/23, 4:28 pm - Kunal: Shall we proceed?
31/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Yes
31/10/23, 4:52 pm - Kunal: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kunal: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

01/11/23, 4:34 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Well they said they do like me to be enrolled in India by Edoofa but they also mentioned the fact that since we are already not financially stable and to raise the $350 dollars required would be hard so in their own views they  suggested they would prefer paying it when l already have my A Level results and are assured l might go 🥴
01/11/23, 4:39 pm - Austin: I do understand Praise, do you know why form 5 students are offered this opportunity to enroll in the Edoofa program early?
01/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 830 1340: No
01/11/23, 7:25 pm - Austin: There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!

1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats. This is the reason, we evaluate the O level and term results, interests and passion, career goals, extracurriculars, achievements, roles of responsibilities etc to evaluate the form 5&6 students for the Edoofa scholarship program. We also allow parents to take part in the sessions on behalf of applicants so that deserving applicants do not miss the golden opportunity.
01/11/23, 7:25 pm - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
01/11/23, 7:26 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

You can also go through this video interview of our CEO, Mr.Angad Singh with *African Global Radio* after getting to know the contribution of Edoofa towards the higher education of African Students.
03/11/23, 10:47 am - Austin: You know, Our major focus has always been to work with growing businesses, contribute to their success and ensure that our students get the learning opportunities that they deserve. I’d like to share another example of a brand that we worked with. It’s a homegrown skin and hair care brand from Zimbabwe called Tia Organics, where our students are helping them with a DIGITAL MARKETING project- helping them increase their online presence, and build their brand through content creation and marketing that will eventually increase their business. 

Another interesting fact about the brand is that it’s a woman-led brand. The Founder Ms Portia, who is a pharmacist has put all her experience to create such wonderful products and is running them successfully on her own. You can always follow them on Instagram to see their progress along with our Edoofians work who engage with the brand on a daily basis.

03/11/23, 12:17 pm - Austin: Noted Praise, that would be fine
03/11/23, 12:17 pm - Austin: Also, have you discussed with your parents about the program?
03/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Yeah we have but they didn't object or agree about it
03/11/23, 12:52 pm - Austin: So when are you planning to send me the final update?
03/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 830 1340: ...
03/11/23, 1:00 pm - Austin: Noted Praise, that would be fine
06/12/23, 3:46 pm - Austin: Greetings to you all! @263788301340 @263773287556 
I hope this message finds you well

We understand that students have been occupied with lessons and academic commitments in the previous months due to which have been unable to actively participate in the sessions or adhere to the application process. Since the learners are back from vacation, we have been experiencing a surge in the number of applications but have decided to offer a final chance to the previous applicants before we revoke their applications. *So do you wish to continue with the Edoofa Scholarship Program?*
06/12/23, 4:14 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Yeah l do wish to continue thank you very much for this other chance
06/12/23, 4:15 pm - Austin: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 4:16 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Alright thank you
06/12/23, 4:16 pm - Austin: You are welcome, Praise! 
Have you completed the discussions regarding the Edoofa program within your family?
06/12/23, 4:17 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Yes we did
06/12/23, 4:20 pm - Austin: So what was the feedback of your family and are they having any questions for me?
06/12/23, 4:25 pm - +263 78 830 1340: I did try to make it as clear as possible l don't know if they had questions  but they didn't give a promising response thier argument still remains on the fact that they cannot pay that 350 before my final exams results are out
06/12/23, 4:38 pm - Austin: Noted Praise and what is their concern about the enrollment fee payment and why do they feel of not enrolling now if you qualify?
06/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 78 830 1340: I do understand them they are not financially stable and all l know is they sacrifice for us to get the education so paying the enrollment fee before l write the final exams which are due next year will also require them to raise some money yet now l still need money for fees and even the exam fee again so l assume it will be easier for them when l am out of school
06/12/23, 8:30 pm - Austin: I understand Praise, as per your understanding is higher education a small decision or a decision that would have a huge impact on your career?
06/12/23, 8:43 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Well l understand it's a decision that would have a huge impact on my career
06/12/23, 9:17 pm - Austin: Absolutely, so do you feel a few months after your A level would be sufficient for the financial and mental preparation to study abroad?
06/12/23, 9:48 pm - +263 78 830 1340: Mentally it's not a problem but financially l always encourage my parents to start preparing now though because the little money has a lot to cover it becomes impossible
