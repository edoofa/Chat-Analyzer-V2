Before we proceed further would you mind to send me your details
08/06/23, 8:58 am - Arshita: I am Ms Arshita, Career Counselor at Edoofa and we have with us Mr Austin, Senior Career Counsellor and Mr Jyotishman, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa.

I have had an incredible opportunity to guide students with their career paths from Different countries, helping them achieve their desired goals and career aspirations in life.

I am a motivator and a life coach and we have a community of more than 3000 parents and students. I will be happy to share references too. Interacting with parents and young minds like your children who want to achieve something big in their journey reassures me that if the right student is provided with the right resources, there is nothing on this planet that is unachievable for them and I would personally help each of them in making the right decision with regards to their higher education.

08/06/23, 8:58 am - Arshita: <Media omitted>
08/06/23, 9:00 am - +263 71 801 4881: So far how many students did you assist
08/06/23, 9:02 am - Arshita: Speaking just about Zimbabwe, as mentioned, we have more than 3000 students who are currently a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program
08/06/23, 9:04 am - Arshita: From the application form of Liona, I noted that you are from Masvingo Province and let me please help you with specific details and associations just from the province as it is much familiar to us .

We have Madam Aleta, Education Inspector, Bikita whose child is an Edoofian. The retired Educationalist-Sir Charles Jerera, who had been working with the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Local Government and retired from the Ministry of Arts, Culture and Recreation. He is in South Africa now working with a School and his child arrived in India on 16th August last year

We hosted counselling sessions for Chiredzi High School under Mr Zwada, the school Head from which 3 Edoofians are studying in India now, Tungwane high is our associate school with the child of the Head studying in India. We are associated with Zaka High and have two former students of St Anthony's here in India(with more than 30 qualifiers for the next intakes). The sessions were hosted for, Gutu High, Dewure High, Silveira, Masvingo Christian College, Pamushana High etc.
08/06/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 801 4881: Ok I get it

I just want to know more about your program.. Nowadays there are highest number of human trafficking cases in Zimbabwe caused by those people who claims to assists children
08/06/23, 9:17 am - Arshita: I do understand your concern, Mrs Seka and yes, a lot of things are happening around us each day which makes it challenging to differentiate between a genuine program and other ones. This counselling session is scheduled to interact with you all to understand the child's aspirations along with addressing the concerns and questions of the family so that we proceed ahead with utmost clarity. I have been sharing and will be guiding you through all aspects of the program but may I ask, have you researched about the Edoofa Scholarship Program, interacted with any of our beneficiaries or their families from Zimbabwe?
08/06/23, 9:21 am - +263 71 801 4881: So according to your words

Is it possible to have counseling session on the ground not online
08/06/23, 9:26 am - Arshita: This counselling session will be online but if your child qualifies for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you will have the opportunity to visit our office at Emerald Hill, Harare to interact with our Senior Academician before you are a part of the program. 

We are receiving 100+ applications from Zimbabwe each day and an offline counselling session will not be practical as students and parents from different parts of the countries will have to travel to Harare and stay there for 2-3 days to be counselled and evaluated offline.
08/06/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 801 4881: Ok thanks..l get you so you can proceed
08/06/23, 9:28 am - Arshita: Glad that we are on the same page now.

Please include your educational qualifications, career aspirations, the province that you live in, hobbies & interests, your family, which professions your parents/guardians are into and more in detail.
You can also add anything more that you would like to share.
08/06/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 801 4881: Yes we may go ahead
08/06/23, 9:35 am - Arshita: Liona , please share more about yourself so that we can proceed.
