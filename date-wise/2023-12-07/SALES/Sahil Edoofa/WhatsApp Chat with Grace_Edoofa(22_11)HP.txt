*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development.

22/11/23, 12:36 pm - +260 765306528: Especially because the course I want to do is a social course......so studying abroad is basically like a game starter for me on the part of using social skills

22/11/23, 1:09 pm - Harmehak: So Grace, now do you have any queries please?
22/11/23, 1:09 pm - +260 96 8421014: Well noted. Thank you n clear.
22/11/23, 1:11 pm - +260 765306528: No queries at all.
22/11/23, 1:12 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Grace and Mr Zulu!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
22/11/23, 1:15 pm - +260 96 8421014: Am for one not do familiar but I know it's unattainable as an individual. You are a lot clear on India but still something lingering my mind. Any other credible places other than India? Same field.
22/11/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please!
22/11/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: No please, scholarship are offered only to those who wish to study in India please.
22/11/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
22/11/23, 1:21 pm - +260 765306528: Interesting
22/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: Grace, I hope now you can realise the difference between costs of India and other western countries?
22/11/23, 1:23 pm - +260 765306528: I have ....
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
22/11/23, 1:28 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 1:33 pm - +260 96 8421014: Wow! Well noted.
22/11/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Mr Zulu, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if she is able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, she would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1600-$2000*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
22/11/23, 1:46 pm - +260 96 8421014: Well explained. Am very clear now. A million thanks.
22/11/23, 1:46 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

So far do you have any queries for me?
22/11/23, 1:50 pm - +260 96 6408899: I think all is well explained will sit discuss and come back to you Harmehak
22/11/23, 1:51 pm - +260 96 8421014: Not at all. Just learnt  that of the 3 of us I was the only who didn't have much but thank God I didn't shy away  I have equally learnt n appreciated the existence of this whole scholarship  thing. It was an affair of mother n daughter kikiki lol! Thanks alot.
22/11/23, 1:52 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

Since we are yet to complete the discussion, shall we proceed ahead?
22/11/23, 1:52 pm - +260 96 8421014: Please do.
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
22/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

22/11/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Have you followed this please?
22/11/23, 2:21 pm - +260 765306528: Yes🫱🏾‍🫲🏿
22/11/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful!
22/11/23, 2:21 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
22/11/23, 2:26 pm - +260 765306528: Nice..
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 8421014: So the Scholarship credit accrues to monthly, yearly or semesterised course assessments? The higher the results the less fees paid. Adverse performance obviously leads to payment of the highest premium as per schedule.
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Very correct please,

It's a monthly analysis.
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - Harmehak: Students are alloted a dedicated mentor who assists them right from the starting while she is still in Zambia till the end of her course!
22/11/23, 2:33 pm - +260 96 8421014: Great!
22/11/23, 2:34 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

22/11/23, 2:37 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

So Mr Zulu, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. The discussion would be concluded in 10-15 minutes.

Are you ready?
22/11/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: Either of you who is available can participate and respond.
22/11/23, 2:59 pm - +260 96 8421014: Okay noted.
22/11/23, 2:59 pm - +260 96 8421014: I went off as I had some visitors. Now fine.
22/11/23, 3:00 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please
22/11/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: Mr Zulu, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
22/11/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
22/11/23, 3:03 pm - +260 96 8421014: Minimum benchmarking 1,500$.
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
22/11/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: You see, Mr Zulu, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
22/11/23, 3:09 pm - +260 96 8421014: Exactly. Certainty  is guaranteed. But our education system in Zambia tend to delay releasing Grade 12 results noting 31 January. Our results may be out say 3rd week February.
22/11/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please, as Grace would be proceeding for provisional admissions and as per her previous results.
22/11/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
22/11/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 96 8421014: Our girl children also tend not to perform well in math meaning a mathematical chance of resitting in August exams. How abt this?
22/11/23, 3:12 pm - +260 96 8421014: Generally speaking though Grace may not be affected by this clause.
22/11/23, 3:13 pm - Harmehak: While that's completely alright, since it won't affect her Bachelor's in the first place, so she need not rewrite mathematics.
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - +260 96 8421014: Noted.
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
22/11/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
22/11/23, 3:23 pm - +260 96 8421014: Yes.
22/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
22/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
22/11/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

22/11/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Mr Zulu.
22/11/23, 3:54 pm - +260 96 8421014: Wow@ you may conclude please.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
22/11/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*

30/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 1:14 pm - Sahil Edoofa: This is the contact of Mr Hammond and his wife Mrs Penny, Directors of Penmal Connect and Trident College. Along with Ms Betty, Mr Hammond's close associate who would assist you with the process ahead

Both Mr Hammond and his wife are our associate partners in Zambia for the Edoofa Scholarship Program. The Image above is from our recent meeting with the Ministries of Education of Zambia, Penamal Connect along with our founders Mr Angad and Mr Avreen. This meeting was scheduled in order to provide more scholarship opportunities for the student of Zambia to Study abroad.

So you can connect with them as well once you get the time to get further clarity about the program and it's procedures.
30/11/23, 1:14 pm - +260 96 8421014: Well explained and we will do exactly that. Thank you so much.
30/11/23, 1:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: If you are ready then you can also pay the enrollment fees today and reserve your seat .

30/11/23, 1:16 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can have a call with her in Zambia , she will assist you with the payment process.
30/11/23, 1:20 pm - Sahil Edoofa: While I do understand that the deadline is of 4th December the key benefit your child would have in this case would be to start the process early with the students who became a part of the Edoofa Program in the Month of November 2023. This inturn would help you to interact with the Admission Team even more early so that you can have a much better financial planning with them.

30/11/23, 1:21 pm - Harmehak: This message was deleted
30/11/23, 1:38 pm - +260 96 8421014: Well explained and understood. I should be able to contact them but making a payment will  be done on 4 December. The January payment is the one that will be made earlier than the said 4 th as going into that period I would have planned n budgeted.
30/11/23, 1:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: It would be much more beneficial for Grace incase you manage to complete a part of the formalities on 30th November which would be today.
30/11/23, 2:04 pm - +260 96 8421014: I would have loved that happen but I have not yet put funds in place. But now that everything looks set, I will grab some somewhere.
30/11/23, 2:08 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can pay partial amount today to reserve the seat and pay remaining next month ?
01/12/23, 12:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

Kindly excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the academic board.

So shall we start your session now ?
02/12/23, 1:28 pm - +260 765306528: Yes
02/12/23, 2:17 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you reserving your seat on monday ?
02/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 96 8421014: Yes. I should deposit as per proposal I made.
02/12/23, 3:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Okay
04/12/23, 11:07 am - +260 96 8421014: Good morning.  Am now making the first deposit of $200 equivant. I will  share the proof of payment soonest.
04/12/23, 11:20 am - Sahil Edoofa: Noted
04/12/23, 12:14 pm - +260 96 6408899: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 12:15 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you in touch with Ms.Betty ?
04/12/23, 12:55 pm - +260 96 8421014: This message was deleted
04/12/23, 1:42 pm - +260 96 8421014: We have finalized. The 5% will be taken care of as I do the $150 balance. I have also been served with the Indo Zambia Bank account number I will use in my future transactions. The balance will  be 5% of $350 based on rate at the time plus the $150. Thanks.
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - +260 96 6408899: Am some what  confused here ... not clear with additional charges🤷‍♀️
04/12/23, 3:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge. 

The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.

So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.

The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $368 ($350 + $18 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha
05/12/23, 6:33 am - +260 96 6408899: To me the difficult part is not the additional charge  on  350 but the additional 5% on all deposits say for 5 years ....fees can still be made direct to the schools.. 5% on a deposit like 3000 is not small money it surpasses wat the banks charge for TT
05/12/23, 12:21 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon 
How are you doing today?
05/12/23, 12:26 pm - +260 96 8421014: Good afternoon. Am getting on well. Thank you so much.
05/12/23, 1:07 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please this amount is not charged by Edoofa actually this is charged by banks for transfers abroad also once Grace is into Grace will have indian bank account so charges will be reduced
05/12/23, 11:59 pm - Sahil Edoofa: .
06/12/23, 11:07 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
06/12/23, 11:32 am - +260 96 8421014: Fine thanks. Am doing well. Getting by one day at a time.
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Admission team will soon start your next session
06/12/23, 3:08 pm - +260 96 8421014: Well noted thanks.
