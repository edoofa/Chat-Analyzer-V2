21/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 78 783 3753: Well l got to learn that it offers scholarships to children  across Africa and helps them get better education
21/09/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Well received, Maria, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 3000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/09/23, 9:38 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200+ schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 783 3753: Okay all heard.this is quite  pleasing
21/09/23, 9:48 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
21/09/23, 9:49 am - +263 78 783 3753: Yes thats what lm looking for .Because it hurts seeing the struggle  parents  put to earn school fees
21/09/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: I do understand Maria!
21/09/23, 9:50 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Maria, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

21/09/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Well Maria now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
21/09/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l do believe it,s a life changing decision.Basing other people ,s testimonies and also given my own thoughts.l believe its an opportunity  for diversity
21/09/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: That's well put across, Maria!

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
21/09/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l am mentally prepared .The courage to apply for Edoofa is a sign of mental preparedness  by itself
21/09/23, 10:26 am - Harmehak: That's great, Maria!

You mentioned your elder sister who is currently at school, may I know what is she pursuing currently?
21/09/23, 10:29 am - +263 78 783 3753: She is currently  doing Pre-medicine.in The untied States of America.She went under a schoolarship.My parents could not afford to pay for her university  tuition  her in Zimbabwe  since the prices have risen for tertiary  education
21/09/23, 10:33 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Maria!

So may I know more about how the program assisted your sister please?
21/09/23, 10:36 am - +263 78 783 3753: Im not fully informed about that yet .Because she went this year August.All l do understand  is that she was given a 100% scholarship and her plane ticket was paid for.I hope to get more information  from her when she is reachable  maybe soon
21/09/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Oh alright please!
21/09/23, 10:44 am - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a 100% scholarship please?
21/09/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 783 3753: Well form what my sister told me .she mentioned  that our parents  dont get to pay any of her fees  and also covers her medical facilities .if l am correct.in short l can say evrthing including  food
21/09/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
21/09/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 783 3753: Okay thank you.now l know the difference
21/09/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!
21/09/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
21/09/23, 10:58 am - +263 78 783 3753: Yes they are ready to do so
21/09/23, 10:59 am - Harmehak: Duly noted Maria!

Currently you are Upper 6 student please?
21/09/23, 11:00 am - +263 78 783 3753: Yeah lm an upper 6 student.And lm writing my End exams from the sixteenth  of October
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please.
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that the students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
21/09/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: However we encourage our students to aim for better results as that leaves a great impression on their application.
21/09/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 783 3753: Thank you Ms Harmehak.l will surely work harder to aim better and good results
21/09/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: That's great!
21/09/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation?
21/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 783 3753: Alevel subjects  are Pure Mathematics , Accounts and Business  Studies
21/09/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
21/09/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: I await your O level results

21/09/23, 11:48 am - Harmehak: I do understand what you are sharing, Maria!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
21/09/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 783 3753: .I know that its best in commerce departments.I got No information  on its Education  systems .But my guess is that they are adjustable
21/09/23, 11:52 am - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

21/09/23, 12:02 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Woow this is quite  impressing from India
21/09/23, 12:02 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Maria!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - +263 78 783 3753: No they are not
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Alright please.
21/09/23, 12:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/09/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay  noted.l think its better than other countries .if one can afford
21/09/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/09/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/09/23, 12:08 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 12:10 pm - +263 78 783 3753: I think this is great  especially  the Earn while you learn program
21/09/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, Maria, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/09/23, 12:12 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay Noted
21/09/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Maria!
21/09/23, 12:13 pm - Harmehak: Maria, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 783 3753: I agree to this.its quite  true
21/09/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Maria?
21/09/23, 12:15 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l can relate much better
21/09/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, please!

Now lets discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist both parents and Melissa.
21/09/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/09/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/09/23, 12:19 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Noted.So in short  one  has to perfome better inorder for the Earn while you learn program ?
21/09/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Every student gets to be a part of the Earn While You Learn Program please.
21/09/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay Ms Harmehak
21/09/23, 12:21 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/09/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Noted
21/09/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/09/23, 12:25 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay .the Program  is really  great  Ma
21/09/23, 12:26 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Mam*
21/09/23, 12:26 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/09/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l now realise the difference
21/09/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, and did you go through the shared pictures and video, Maria?
21/09/23, 12:33 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l did go through  them.its interesting to know that one can earn such amounts of money  through  credits
21/09/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Maria!

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/09/23, 12:35 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l am ready
21/09/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Maria, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/09/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/09/23, 12:38 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Well probably  $2250
21/09/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/09/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/09/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 12:40 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Ohhh l see  where  is the payment  done
21/09/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/09/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: The payment is done after you are found eligible and you receive acceptance letter through banking modes please.
21/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay  notef
21/09/23, 12:41 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Noted*
21/09/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/09/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/09/23, 12:42 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/09/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Well considered  .l think this is super great
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: I am glad, Maria!
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/09/23, 12:47 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/09/23, 12:50 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes l do understand
21/09/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/09/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
21/09/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

21/09/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
21/09/23, 12:54 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

21/09/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: Feel free to connect your parents with Mrs Ruth, Maria!
21/09/23, 1:00 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Okay Mam
21/09/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/09/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/09/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Are you clear about the same?

25/09/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 783 3753: Yes they  are
25/09/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Can they acknowledge the same in the group
25/09/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 357 2570: Yes
25/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 8:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th September 2023 for $200 and the 29th or 30th of October for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th of September 2023.
 Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?

27/09/23, 1:22 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I hope you have done some savings for your child's Tertiary education ? <This message was edited>
27/09/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 357 2570: We start to save from now till july
27/09/23, 1:31 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Maria, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Maria's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
28/09/23, 11:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning
How are you doing today?
29/09/23, 10:42 am - Sahil Edoofa: May I know what challenges are you facing ?
29/09/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 357 2570: Application fee first
29/09/23, 11:14 am - Sahil Edoofa: Can you answer this ?
29/09/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 357 2570: Specify l didn't actually get your point l said l want her to go out of Zimbabwe to learn but for now l don't have money l will get the money end of October

29/09/23, 5:23 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Exactly @263773572570 and this is why I was expecting to hearing from you so that I could assist you in completing the necessary formalities step by step so you are not financially burdened. Don't you believe this would help you?
29/09/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 357 2570: Yes it would help me
30/09/23, 10:21 am - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Maria's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Maria's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?@263773572570
