05/12/23, 10:13 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Prominent, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, is that correct?
05/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
05/12/23, 10:20 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Kudakwashe, also do tell me whether you learnt about Kudakwashe’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/12/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 895 0480: I learnt that the program is more beneficial to a greater extent and to my understanding the journey is competitive since the program is whispered
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 10:44 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/12/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 895 0480: I got the sense
05/12/23, 10:58 am - +263 77 895 0480: Thus correct
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Prominent, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 11:46 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 5:04 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
06/12/23, 7:18 am - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 7:52 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

“It is only when we take chances, when our lives improve..”

06/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Afternoon sir

06/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: As you know the evaluation of your application begins in this counseling session, followed by the eligibility check by our Academic Board.

06/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Mr Gunguvo Headmaster.vcf (file attached)
06/12/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Headmaster's contact
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Gurvinder: So now as we proceed ahead, I have a question, during your introduction you mentioned you would like to study medicine, could you please share what motivates you behind this field of study?
06/12/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I want to help the sick in the country and world at large. Having a better understanding of chemistry at school, love to serve life
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: That is a noble cause.
06/12/23, 2:47 pm - Gurvinder: So if I may ask from your family or known circle has anyone pursued a career in this field?
06/12/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 895 0480: No
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: Alright so now can you share your O Level and Form 5 results for evaluation?
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 895 0480: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: Please send form 5 results too.
06/12/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Okay
06/12/23, 3:33 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - Gurvinder: If you remember the results you can send through text too.
06/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Pure mathematics: C
Physics: B
Chemistry: B 
The picture will follow
06/12/23, 3:44 pm - Gurvinder: Prominent, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*.
06/12/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Thus correct
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Gurvinder: So, therefore, I cannot offer you a subject in medicine but I can in engineering.
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - +263 77 895 0480: What about civil engineering
06/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Yes, that is possible.
06/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: So do you want to go in that direction?
06/12/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
06/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Civil engineering is right too
06/12/23, 3:58 pm - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and motivation toward the Subject
According to my expertise, the following course will cater to all your likings and will help you achieve your future goals:

*B.Tech Civil Engineering*
06/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 895 0480: That one is right sir
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 4:01 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes sir I am confident
06/12/23, 4:04 pm - +263 77 895 0480: I got it
06/12/23, 4:05 pm - Gurvinder: That is great.
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
06/12/23, 4:07 pm - +263 77 895 0480: Yes
