Tomorrow we celebrate *Dusherra*, which is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. Hence we will connect for our session on Wednesday at 10:00 AM CAT.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage and that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.*

26/10/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: Hi, I hope you are in good health.
I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed in your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However *please Note by Saturday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply*  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
