01/12/23, 4:33 pm - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Daphne Guramatunhu!
 
You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student. 

I hope I have contacted the right person?

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot tomorrow morning at 9 AM CAT, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for a 2-hour counseling session so that we can process your application.
01/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 77 325 3493: It's okay
01/12/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 325 3493: yes it's the right person
02/12/23, 9:33 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Daphne,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
02/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 77 325 3493: okay Mr Gurvinder
02/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Daphne, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Denzel, is that correct?
02/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 77 325 3493: From Ngoni, Denzel's friend
02/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
02/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Ngoni, also do tell me whether you learnt about Denzel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
02/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 325 3493: Let me be honest, I didn't get to learn about Denzel's journey... I just thought that it'll be okay and interesting to have my own journey
02/12/23, 10:16 am - Gurvinder: That is great.
02/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
02/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
02/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
02/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
02/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
02/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 325 3493: okay I read through and I think I comprehend
02/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 77 325 3493: yes it is
02/12/23, 11:06 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Daphne, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
02/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 325 3493: yes
02/12/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Alright so Daphne, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

I would like to know you better as a student, so please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself, your education, what you wish to study, your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background, *Where do your parents work (Place) in your country or any other country that they have relocated to due to work promises?  Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
02/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 325 3493: I'm a well motivated student that is eager to positively influence the upcoming youth but firstly my siblings.I passed my O'level with 1 A, 6 B's and a C and proceeded my A'level with commercial subjects.
I'll list them in order of which subject I'm best in ... Accounts, Statistics and Business studies 
In that I said say I'm good in subjects that include arithmetical operations in them and not so good for the opposite subjects. Nevertheless, although I'm a fast learner I'm slow with calculations and writing making me not finish in a short period of time but it can be prevented.
I look doing Art for hobby not so good in sports but I did try valley ball.
My father is an electrician and a lead artisan in that field. My mother is a housewife. I do live with both parents and they're not separated.
02/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
02/12/23, 11:40 am - Gurvinder: So Daphne, could you kindly tell me how much *Chinhoyi high school* charges you every term, who in your family financially supports your education, and what profession they are in?
02/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 325 3493: it used to be $80 but currently raised to $143 ,USD day scholar fee tho
02/12/23, 12:08 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

04/12/23, 7:16 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!

*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 4:54 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Daphne, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons that I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
06/12/23, 7:03 pm - Gurvinder: Hi Daphine, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application. Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further.

06/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 325 3493: Hey
06/12/23, 7:05 pm - +263 77 325 3493: I'm sorry but I can't continue with the Edoofa scholarship program because my closet friend obtained the same scholarship
06/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 325 3493: and me obtaining it will disappoint her because it will seem like I copied her
06/12/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 325 3493: I'm really sorry I couldn't reach out to you earlier
