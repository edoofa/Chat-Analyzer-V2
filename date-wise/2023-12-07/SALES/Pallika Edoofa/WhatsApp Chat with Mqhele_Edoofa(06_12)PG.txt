06/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 71 800 7862: I will share my o level results soon
06/12/23, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
06/12/23, 11:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
06/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 71 800 7862: Yes am very much confident
06/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 800 7862: This is my first application so far
06/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 800 7862: I will share them at the end of the day
06/12/23, 11:24 am - +263 71 800 7862: Ok thank you so much let me go through it
06/12/23, 11:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me know once done
06/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 71 800 7862: Am done .Well this had already lay a good foundation on me as a student who aspires to study at Edoofa
06/12/23, 11:39 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mqhele, as we proceed, I would like to know that if you are interested in medical sciences, why haven't you opted for Physics in A level?
06/12/23, 11:42 am - +263 71 800 7862: Physics was one of my  weaknesses  during  O level and I got  a C in the end result hence I knew it would give me problems if I opted for it at A level
06/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mqhele, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that you are not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that you are eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field
