We have received the application of Tinashe for the Edoofa scholarship program and I will be taking you all forward through the counseling session to discuss and evaluate your application. Let me know once you are available!
06/12/23, 10:04 am - Pallika Edoofa: Commencing the session, It is good to see that you have taken the time to learn about the program and fill out the application form. Can you please tell me:
*1)  What motivated you to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program?*
*2) What is your understanding of the program as per your discussions with Adrian?*
06/12/23, 11:30 am - +263 71 418 5330: I have always dreamt of studying and pursuing my tertiary education abroad and also the fees hikes whereby universities now charge $450- $600  a term also motivated me to apply for this scholarship program.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when  studying.We are all well aware of the expenses we have to face just to access internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $20 amonth to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $240 annually.
It is enlightening to discover that in India education is valued to the extent that one can acquire the internet for as little as 40 dollars annually 

Furthermore when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of study due to limited number of seats available at universities . Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I was enlightened about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
06/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Tinashe, Thank you for sharing your aspirations and the challenges you've faced in pursuing tertiary education. It's commendable to see your determination to overcome obstacles, especially regarding the rising costs of education and internet access.

I understand the significance of the internet in today's education landscape, and it's eye-opening to hear about the stark differences in internet expenses between countries. The value placed on education in India, reflected in the affordable internet rates, is indeed noteworthy.
06/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me add more information to it.
06/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4,000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5,000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
06/12/23, 11:32 am - Pallika Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabwe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries, and many others. In Manicaland, we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice, and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, You would be happy to know that the DEOs of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo has 24 Schools that collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High, and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke. We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central, and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 
Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo add a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 



The Schools, Institutions, and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized designers of EDOOFA in Zimbabwe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), and Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud Zimbabwean students and parents community of more than 2500 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
