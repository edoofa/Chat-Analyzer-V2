06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: And, As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country.

06/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 724 4398: But I did research on foreign education
06/12/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 724 4398: Noted
06/12/23, 1:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 724 4398: I have gone through the article and I understand exactly what is required for me to do
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 724 4398: True the major problem that the youth face is employability that is why when I was informed of the Edoofa program I was interested
06/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes exactly!!
06/12/23, 2:19 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Based on my evaluation, considering your subjects, interests, and passion, you are eligible to pursue
