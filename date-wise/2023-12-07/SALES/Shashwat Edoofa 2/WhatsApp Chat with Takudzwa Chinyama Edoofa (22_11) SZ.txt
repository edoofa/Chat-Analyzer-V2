29/11/23, 2:05 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwa. Since the Healthcare Sector encompasses a wide range of specialties, may I inquire about the specific area that intrigues you?
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Medical Dr , specifically Surgeon
29/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Noted. Well, Takudzwa, could you please share why you didn't pursue Biology in your A level?

I believe it is a very crucial science/medical subject, isn't it?
29/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Yeah it's a very crucial medical subject, l didn't pursued biology Because of the problem-solving aspect of physics over the memorization aspect of biology.  I'm really good at mathematics that's why l chose Physics.
29/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 71 285 2773: I also heard that MPC is an universal combination it applies to all fields , that's why l didn't do biology , the idea is to shift to maybe chemical engineering when my first dream of becoming Dr fails , yea that's the other reason
29/11/23, 3:56 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any *Engineering Course* then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
29/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Noted
29/11/23, 4:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Could you kindly share your thoughts on the career field that captivates you the most and the origins of your interest? Your insights, along with any specific experiences that ignited your fascination for this field, would be greatly appreciated?
29/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Well l think the origins of my interest were rooted in my desire to help people. I would want to be able to make a positive difference in people's lives and help them when they're in need. Yea l think l have a natural inclination towards helping others ..

30/11/23, 5:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwa. Your A-Level subject combination of Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics is considered a highly favorable choice for students aspiring to pursue engineering. Could you kindly enlighten me about the motivation that inspired you to opt for this particular combination? Your insights would be genuinely valuable in understanding your academic journey and aspirations
30/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 71 285 2773: My choice of subjects was motivated by my interest in the natural sciences and mathematics, and my desire to pursue a career in engineering/ medical science. I've always been fascinated by the way the world works, and how math and science can be used to understand and improve it. I also believe that engineering is a field with a lot of potential for innovation and problem-solving, and I want to be a part of that,One of the things that really inspired me to pursue engineering was learning about the work of notable engineers like Nikola Tesla and Elon Musk. Their innovative and forward-thinking approaches to problem-solving really resonated with me, and made me want to pursue a similar path.

04/12/23, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Takudzwa! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
04/12/23, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 4:41 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?

*"Success is not a destination; it's a journey of continuous improvement and self-discovery." - Brian Tracy*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
05/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Good afternoon,I'm ready
05/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Takudzwa!
05/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have had a discussion with your parents, please?
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Yes l heard a discussion with them , they agreed . They're not online for now , they will acknowledge here soon
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Takudzwa! You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
05/12/23, 7:38 pm - +263 71 285 2773: I reached to them now , my daddy's whatsapp expired , he's looking forward to update it tomorrow so that he can reach out to you
05/12/23, 7:39 pm - +263 71 285 2773: I think through Earn while you learn programs 😊
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Takudzwa. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/12/23, 7:53 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
05/12/23, 8:33 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Yep this will be very beneficial for me
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
05/12/23, 8:51 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

05/12/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
05/12/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
05/12/23, 9:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?

06/12/23, 11:02 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?

06/12/23, 10:49 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Yea
06/12/23, 10:49 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Ok thank you, Good night
06/12/23, 10:54 pm - +263 71 285 2773: Those are definitely the most important components,  there may be a few other things you'll need depending on the specific university and program you're applying to. For example, you may need to provide proof of financial support, transcripts from previous schooling, standardized test scores (like the GRE, TOEFL, or IELTS), and possibly an interview.
