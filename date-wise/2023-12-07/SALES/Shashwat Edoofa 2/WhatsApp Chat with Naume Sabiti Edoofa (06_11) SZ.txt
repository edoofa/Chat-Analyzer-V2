In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.

This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food

06/12/23, 9:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
06/12/23, 9:27 pm - +263 71 434 8309: Yes it is affordable

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.
