05/12/23, 5:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Thank you for sharing, Tsungi. I appreciate your sincerity!
05/12/23, 5:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
05/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 77 142 2562: Yes Sir 
I am very confident
05/12/23, 7:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colors! Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly?

I want to be a helping hand in my community.
I want to depend on myself not on other people but myself.
