05/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Priscilla.
05/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Priscilla, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD St james charged you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
05/12/23, 1:27 pm - +263 78 811 6367: My name is Priscilla Muyako. I am at the age of eighteen and wrote my ZIMSEC A'level exams in November 2022. I pursued my high school education at St James High School. The fees per term were about 500 USD as it was a boarding school. I have always been interested in Mechanical engineering because it is a hands-on and broad department thus, I did sciences in high school. One of my strengths is my ability to adapt quickly to new situations and learn new concepts effectively. I am also a good communicator and enjoy collaborating with others. As for weaknesses, I sometimes tend to be overly critical of my own work, which can hinder my confidence at times. However, I constantly strive to improve and overcome these challenges. In my free time, I enjoy reading books because I believe there is a lot to learn and we will never know it all but learning one new thing per day can improve the world.                                                                                                                                                                       I am the second child in a family of five. My father is an Environmental Health Technician while my mother is a business woman.                                                                                                                                                               I hope this clarifies the information you were seeking. If you have any further questions, please feel free to ask.
05/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 840 2047: This message was deleted
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Priscilla, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.
05/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Thank you for your kind words. I'm glad that my responses have been well received and that you appreciate the honesty and transparency in my communication.
05/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please, Priscilla.

So you happened to share your A level last year,

So what have you been doing post that?
05/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I got enrolled at Midlands State University in August this year and I am doing Mechanical engineering.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

So you wish to continue your Bachelors in India instead?
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Thats right
05/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: Very well, and what made you change your mind, Priscilla?
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I have been trying to apply with no responses. Fortunately this time I got the opportunity to talk to you.
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please, 

I can understand.
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - Harmehak: Well Priscilla, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Yes. It is a life changing decision as one has to go to a new place, new country with no one they know. I believe such a decision is taken after much consideration.
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: That's very correct, Priscilla.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
05/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Absolutely! I believe that being mentally prepared for life abroad involves being open-minded, resilent, and willing to step out of my comfort zone. I have been to boarding schools and that tought me to live away from family and fight my battles alone. This time I am  ready to build new connections with fellow students and and learn new cultures of another country. Considering that there are other Zimbabweans enrolled on this program, I am sure I will be able to sail through it and I am sure I will have personell to guide me like you.
05/12/23, 2:13 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful, Priscilla.

I appreciate your thoughts.

Are you aware we have students from your school as well who are a part of the program, Priscilla?
05/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I know about students from Marist I didn't know about St James. That means the Edoofa schorlship program is really changing the lives of many.Hopefully I will be part of those blessed to be part of your program.
05/12/23, 2:55 pm - Harmehak: We do look forward to the same, Priscilla.
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: So Priscilla, now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Yes they are aware
05/12/23, 2:56 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Are they willing to support you as well please?
05/12/23, 2:59 pm - +263 78 811 6367: They are willing to support me. I know a scholarship is for exposure and connections but honestly my main reason to apply is financial problems
05/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate, Priscilla?
05/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 811 6367: My parents are willing to support me through this but I'm not sure how much the charges and cost to prepare everything and travel are hence I can't tell if my parents can afford all that
05/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: I would brief you about the same in detail, Priscilla
05/12/23, 3:35 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, may I have your results?
05/12/23, 4:33 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation, Priscilla.
05/12/23, 4:47 pm - +263 78 811 6367: My apologies, I had to scan the documents
05/12/23, 4:47 pm - Harmehak: I understand please.
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 811 6367: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: Duly received please, Priscilla.

I would share them for evaluation.
05/12/23, 4:48 pm - Harmehak: So may I know what motivates you to study Mechanical engineering?
05/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I am a hands on person and growing up elders would call it being naughty. Whenever I see a machine system I am interested in what exactly enables its mechanism and the design of the machines. It got to a point of opening some of the old machines and gadgets at home just to figure out the design and mechanism. I am also interested in improving some machines and inventing machines that carry out certain tasks to reduce load.
05/12/23, 4:54 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Hopefully I stand a chance to capture and impress.
05/12/23, 4:58 pm - Harmehak: That's a great thought, Priscilla.

Let me brief you about your desired course.
05/12/23, 4:59 pm - Harmehak: *B.Tech. Mechanical Engineering* is a 4-year undergraduate course

First thing any engineering aspirant considers while choosing a branch in Engineering is placement aspect and the course very well caters to it. A few questions which arise when admissions to engineering colleges commence include the branch in demand, highest paid engineering graduates and others such.  Apart from this palcement criteria, there are some other parameters which should be considered while choosing a discipline like- what are the research opportunities, what is scope of career growth etc.

Mechanical Engineering is the evergreen branch of engineering. Market scenario and demand of engineering graduates change every year but the demand of mechanical engineering degree will never be obsolete. Mechanical engineering graduates can find placements in almost every sector, right from construction sector to steel industry and from automobile to software.

Following are the sub disciplines that are associated with mechanical engineering:

*Production Engineering*
*Industrial Engineering*
*Manufacturing Engineering*
*Automobile Engineering*
*Artificial Intelligence*

The field of mechanical engineering can be thought of as a collection of many mechanical engineering science disciplines. Several of these subdisciplines which are typically taught at the undergraduate level are listed below, with a brief explanation and the most common application of each. Some of these subdisciplines are unique to mechanical engineering, while others are a combination of mechanical engineering and one or more other disciplines. Most work that a mechanical engineer does uses skills and techniques from several of these subdisciplines, as well as specialized subdisciplines. Specialized subdisciplines, as used in this article, are more likely to be the subject of graduate studies or on-the-job training than undergraduate research. Several specialized sub disciplines are discussed in this section.

*Mechanics* 

Mechanics is, in the most general sense, the study of forces and their effect upon matter. Typically, engineering mechanics is used to analyze and predict the acceleration and deformation (both elastic and plastic) of objects under known forces (also called loads) or stresses. Subdisciplines of mechanics include Statics, the study of non-moving bodies under known loads, how forces affect static bodies Dynamics the study of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics includes kinematics (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations). Mechanics of materials, the study of how different materials deform under various types of stress Fluid mechanics, the study of how fluids react to forces Kinematics, the study of the motion of bodies (objects) and systems (groups of objects), while ignoring the forces that cause the motion. Kinematics is often used in the design and analysis of mechanisms. Continuum mechanics, a method of applying mechanics that assumes that objects are continuous (rather than discrete) Mechanical engineers typically use mechanics in the design or analysis phases of engineering. If the engineering project were the design of a vehicle, statics might be employed to design the frame of the vehicle, in order to evaluate where the stresses will be most intense. Dynamics might be used when designing the car's engine, to evaluate the forces in the pistons and cams as the engine cycles. Mechanics of materials might be used to choose appropriate materials for the frame and engine. Fluid mechanics might be used to design a ventilation system for the vehicle (see HVAC), or to design the intake system for the engine

*Mechatronics and Robotics*

Mechatronics is a combination of mechanics and electronics. It is an interdisciplinary branch of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering and software engineering that is concerned with integrating electrical and mechanical engineering to create hybrid systems. In this way, machines can be automated through the use of electric motors, servo-mechanisms, and other electrical systems in conjunction with special software. A common example of a mechatronics system is a CD-ROM drive. Mechanical systems open and close the drive, spin the CD and move the laser, while an optical system reads the data on the CD and converts it to bits. Integrated software controls the process and communicates the contents of the CD to the computer.

Robotics is the application of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs kinematics (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).

Robots are used extensively in industrial engineering. They allow businesses to save money on labor, perform tasks that are either too dangerous or too precise for humans to perform them economically, and to ensure better quality. Many companies employ assembly lines of robots, especially in Automotive Industries and some factories are so robotized that they can run by themselves. Outside the factory, robots have been employed in bomb disposal, space exploration, and many other fields. Robots are also sold for various residential applications, from recreation to domestic applications.

*Thermodynamics and Thermo-science*

Thermodynamics is an applied science used in several branches of engineering, including mechanical and chemical engineering. At its simplest, thermodynamics is the study of energy, its use and transformation through a system. Typically, engineering thermodynamics is concerned with changing energy from one form to another. As an example, automotive engines convert chemical energy (enthalpy) from the fuel into heat, and then into mechanical work that eventually turns the wheels.

Thermodynamics principles are used by mechanical engineers in the fields of heat transfer, thermofluids, and energy conversion. Mechanical engineers use thermo-science to design engines and power plants, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems, heat exchangers, heat sinks, radiators, refrigeration, insulation, and others.

*Design and drafting*

Drafting or technical drawing is the means by which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a drafter or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.

Instructions for manufacturing a part must be fed to the necessary machinery, either manually, through programmed instructions, or through the use of a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) or combined CAD/CAM program. Optionally, an engineer may also manually manufacture a part using the technical drawings. However, with the advent of computer numerically controlled (CNC) manufacturing, parts can now be fabricated without the need for constant technician input. Manually manufactured parts generally consist of spray coatings, surface finishes, and other processes that cannot economically or practically be done by a machine.

Drafting is used in nearly every subdiscipline of mechanical engineering, and by many other branches of engineering and architecture. Three-dimensional models created using CAD software are also commonly used in finite element analysis (FEA) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD).

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
05/12/23, 5:19 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I believe  that having an educational background of different countries strengthens one's capability and connections. I already have  education from Africa and I believe that diversifying my education and cultures would allow me to learn more and be able to work in any environment considering that I would be able to fit in.
05/12/23, 5:20 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Priscilla.

05/12/23, 6:29 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Apologies, my network is slow
05/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
05/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: However, have you followed the discussion so far?
05/12/23, 6:31 pm - +263 78 811 6367: From what you said I understand it is a golden opportunity to  study in India as the education system will not be limited to being considered only in India but globally
05/12/23, 6:33 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Priscilla.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
05/12/23, 6:33 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Not at all
05/12/23, 6:44 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
05/12/23, 6:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Okay that is great
05/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 811 6367: It is a great way to help students acquire the best education at affordable prices which is a great a opportunity to fulfill one's dreams
05/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, Priscilla!
05/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.

However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2000, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
05/12/23, 6:53 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same?
05/12/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 811 6367: I think that chance is great. The fact that students can rely on the earn while you learn program which can accommodate those with financial problems is great and very considerate
05/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Indeed, Priscilla.
05/12/23, 7:21 pm - Harmehak: Priscilla, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
05/12/23, 7:24 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Yes that is very true
05/12/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: So given the costs in Zimbabwe and India, are you now in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Priscilla?
05/12/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Yes, the edoofa schorlaship really makes higher education and affordable which helps students fulfill their dreams
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
05/12/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

05/12/23, 7:43 pm - +263 78 811 6367: Now I fully understand the earn While You Learn Program
05/12/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: That's great
05/12/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
05/12/23, 8:54 pm - Harmehak: Have you been able to follow the discussion so far, Priscilla?
05/12/23, 10:50 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
05/12/23, 10:50 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the shared video.

06/12/23, 5:13 am - +263 78 811 6367: I would love to admit, the Edoofa scholarship program is a blessing to all students globally
06/12/23, 9:21 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
06/12/23, 10:38 am - +263 78 811 6367: Yes
06/12/23, 10:47 am - Harmehak: I appreciate,

So far, do you have any queries, Priscilla?
06/12/23, 10:51 am - +263 78 811 6367: Not at all. You have done a great job and I understood everything <This message was edited>
06/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

06/12/23, 11:04 am - +263 78 811 6367: Yes this is very different.... catering a portion of the tuition and then giving willing the students a chance to self-sponsor the remaining part that's making it easier for those with financial issues to still fulfill their dreams with hardwork and dedication.
06/12/23, 11:05 am - Harmehak: That is great, and I am glad you are thoroughly following, Priscilla.

So now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
06/12/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 811 6367: Yes
06/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: Priscilla, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
06/12/23, 11:06 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
06/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 811 6367: About $1500 to $2250
06/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
06/12/23, 11:08 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 811 6367: That is a great consideration
06/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
06/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 811 6367: Yes that's right. The whole process becomes easier
06/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
06/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
06/12/23, 11:12 am - Harmehak: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
06/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 811 6367: Following
06/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
06/12/23, 11:13 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
06/12/23, 11:14 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
06/12/23, 11:15 am - +263 78 811 6367: Yes
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
06/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

06/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Do feel free to connect Mrs Ruth with your parents too.
06/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 811 6367: Ok thank you
06/12/23, 11:58 am - Harmehak: So far, do you have any queries please?
06/12/23, 12:01 pm - +263 78 811 6367: No. You have clarified everything
06/12/23, 12:07 pm - Harmehak: I am glad.
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

06/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.

06/12/23, 12:11 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome, Priscilla.
06/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Dear Priscilla,

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. Tomorrow, on “07-12-23” at 12:30 P.M. CAT, I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
