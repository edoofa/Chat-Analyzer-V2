You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 4:12 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

06/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: This message was deleted
06/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
06/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 78 591 8462: I was at Chipindura high school..Mashonaland Central

06/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 78 591 8462: I really don't know him ....I enrolled at Chipindura for my A level studies only in 2022
06/12/23, 11:02 am - Harmehak: I can understand please.

You can ask your friends at Chipindura too!
06/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Tanaka, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
06/12/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 591 8462: Ohk I will definitely do that
06/12/23, 11:04 am - Harmehak: Yes please
06/12/23, 11:11 am - +263 78 591 8462: Ohk..well
I did my O level at Zimbabwe Republic Police high school and I did reasonably  well and i  then enrolled at Chipindura for my A level...I did Mathematics, biology and chemistry and by the grace of God I would like to study medicine and I would like to become a Gyenacolgist one day....
I am not sure of my strengths but my weakness is lack of confidence to express myself ,my hobby is playing basketball.

My parents are civil servants,my mother is a teacher and my father is a police officer and I have two siblings
06/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed, Tanaka, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself please.

May I know more about your siblings please?
06/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 591 8462: Thank you
I have a little brother who is doing form2 at Chipindura high school and a little sister who is grade 5
06/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Tanaka!
06/12/23, 11:26 am - Harmehak: What subjects does your mother teach please?
06/12/23, 11:27 am - +263 78 591 8462: She is a primary school teacher who teaches ICT
06/12/23, 11:44 am - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanaka
06/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: Well Tanaka now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
06/12/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 591 8462: I really believe its life changing because studying abroad will help me gain experience and confidence and the fact that I  have studied abroad will put me at an advantage of being recognised as more than capable
06/12/23, 12:20 pm - Harmehak: Well put across, Tanaka.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
06/12/23, 12:24 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am not quite sure about being mentally prepared because I have never gone out of the country before and away from my mother for long ...And judging from my confidence I am very scared
06/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: I understand your concerns, Tanaka.

However what exactly are your concerns?
06/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am scared of racism to be honest and communication
06/12/23, 12:45 pm - Harmehak: You donot have to worry about the same as having had 2000 student under the program, we haven't been reported one case of racism please.

And English is a common language, Tanaka.
06/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright thank you for the reassurance.
06/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Yes please
06/12/23, 12:59 pm - Harmehak: I would be more than happy to connect you with students as well later in the process.
06/12/23, 1:00 pm - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
06/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Yes .my family members are aware ,and I think my mother is willing to support in any way
06/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: That's great.
06/12/23, 1:18 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
06/12/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I am confident that's I will get good points
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: That's great
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study medicine ?
06/12/23, 2:58 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright but I only have my result slip,I haven't yet collected my certificate
06/12/23, 3:04 pm - Harmehak: You can share the result slip.

However do ensure active participation.
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Ohh am sorry for the late late reply
06/12/23, 3:05 pm - Harmehak: I understand.
06/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 591 8462: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 3:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted,

I receive the response to the other part.
06/12/23, 3:23 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Studying medicine has always been my passion . I just want to be able to save a life one day
06/12/23, 3:31 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanaka 

So did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine too?
06/12/23, 3:33 pm - +263 78 591 8462: I have not yet researched
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
06/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 78 591 8462: Alright. So how well should you do in these subjects
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
06/12/23, 4:39 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
06/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 591 8462: The network at my place is unstable ,that's why sometimes I reply late
