For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 412 4684: We are ready sir
01/09/23, 9:20 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir we may start
01/09/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 635 4736: Yes sir I'm done
01/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Done sir
01/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/09/23, 9:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/09/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Clear sir
01/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Very well sir
01/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/09/23, 10:22 pm - +263 77 412 4684: *DIVINE MERCY REFLECTION: Severity Postponed*

It’s important to know that Jesus has every right to bring forth His justice here and now.  He has every right to be severe with us on account of our sins and to bring eternal judgment upon us.  This truth is often forgotten on account of His Mercy.  But we should never forget this fact.  It’s important to remember this because unless we understand the absolute right that God has to execute swift and irrevocable judgment on the world, we will never understand that His restraint is an act of immeasurable Mercy.  The Mother of God is especially entrusted with the responsibility of praying for His Mercy and pleading on our behalf that her Son’s wrath be withheld.  God gave to her this responsibility of intercession for us and He listens to those prayers.  He also calls each one of us to pray for Mercy in the world and, though our prayers are not as powerful as the Mother of God, they can be if we place them in her Immaculate Heart.  Giving our Blessed Mother our prayers magnifies their power and transforms them into an instrument of unfathomable grace, holding back the hand of the Justice of God (See Diary #1261).

Do you understand the right that God has to bring sudden and severe judgment upon you?  That may not be pleasant to think about but it’s important to understand.  Ponder this fact today.  Believe it and know that He withholds His judgment on account of His Mercy.  Seek the prayers of our Blessed Mother, this day, and offer her your own prayers.  Through your prayers, offered through her intercession, God’s justice is withheld and His Mercy will be bestowed in our time.

*PRAYER:*
_Dearest Mother, I offer you, this day, all my prayers, works and sacrifices so that you may in turn offer them to Your Son.  Please pray for me and for all your children that the justice of Your Son will be withheld as His Mercy is poured forth.  Jesus, I trust in You._

02/09/23, 10:14 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In addition, I am now sharing you with step 6 again. 

*Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.

08/09/23, 2:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon Dear Parents and Precious, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that positive note I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

Shall we begin?
08/09/23, 9:24 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry we can begin
08/09/23, 9:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to listen to the audios?
11/09/23, 8:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Precious!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir l had a power cut for 24 hrs  from yesterday upto this day around 12 noon. My battery was dead very sorry.
12/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I learnt that we should be watchiful for fraudsters as they might ask for a lot of money . We are able to get a scholarship.We have to display skills so as to get a scholarship. Be smart and resourceful
12/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I responded about the audios
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Precious. I hope this message finds you well and blessed.
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
12/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
12/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 412 4684: We are on the same page sir.May l also  inform you that Precious is back at school and they are not allowed to use phones.
12/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended. Thank you for letting me know Mrs. Gutu..
12/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
12/09/23, 7:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:30 PM.
12/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

18/09/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Precious,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further as it was a long weekend, our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 8:11 pm - +263 77 412 4684: The weekend was ok.How about yours sir.
18/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I managed to send the required documents
18/09/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking.
18/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the documents. With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
18/09/23, 8:29 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Very accurate sir thank you
18/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
18/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm ready sir we can move on
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
18/09/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
19/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Precious!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
20/09/23, 6:58 am - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry sir just received your messages like now l had no data to receive Whatsapp messages. I read the messages and l understood them.
20/09/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely Evening?
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 412 4684: The evening is cool after a very hot day. Good evening sir
20/09/23, 8:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session?
20/09/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes sir
20/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
20/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
20/09/23, 8:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
20/09/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 412 4684: That's correct.My question is how do we know the best university to choose? Are you going to guide us on choosing because we don't know the universities
20/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, indeed we will be there for you to guide you through the process.
20/09/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you very much
20/09/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I understand sir
21/09/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, parents and Precious.

I was not able to further connect with you yesterday, how is your afternoon going? <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 8:10 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening sir we are ok
21/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm ready sir
21/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
21/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
21/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
21/09/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes sir l have taken note.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
21/09/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
21/09/23, 9:02 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm getting that sir thank you
21/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
21/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
21/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
21/09/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
21/09/23, 10:08 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir l can understand
21/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have completely understood the admission process. In the meantime, we will focus on your admission journey. Now that you have a clear understanding of the admission process, I encourage you to have a discussion with your family regarding the financial requirements. This will allow them to plan effectively and move in the right direction.
21/09/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Given that your university admission is scheduled for the August 2024 intake, our next step is to reconnect with you and discuss when to commence the same journey. 

We have scheduled our session for Tomorrow at 3:00 p.m. to begin the admission process. Please ensure that both you and your parents are available for this session. We understand that unforeseen circumstances can arise, and if, for any reason, you or your parents cannot connect as planned, kindly inform us in advance.
21/09/23, 10:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, my available hours are coming to an end. We shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further proceedings of our session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/09/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening.

I hope you are as excited as I am as we are approaching the weekend. Please how are you doing this lovely evening?
22/09/23, 7:57 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm good how are you sir
22/09/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
22/09/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 412 4684: That will be great sir thank you for the journey so far.
22/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

22/09/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Oh they were so many and looks very happy

22/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
22/09/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
22/09/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
22/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I have reviewed them sir we can proceed
22/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
22/09/23, 9:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, the responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point? <This message was edited>
22/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I seem to understand.
22/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
22/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
22/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes sir lm following.
22/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
22/09/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
22/09/23, 9:53 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Its very clear sir
22/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
22/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
22/09/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 23, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 30, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 23, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
22/09/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm following sir
25/09/23, 8:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Precious.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely evening?
25/09/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm doing quite good.How are you sir
25/09/23, 9:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm ready
25/09/23, 10:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
25/09/23, 10:19 pm - +263 77 412 4684: You can provide information please sir
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
25/09/23, 10:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
25/09/23, 10:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it is late, my available hours are coming to an end. We shall connect tomorrow at 7:30 PM for further proceedings of our session. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
25/09/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir and have a wonderful night
26/09/23, 9:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'd like to provide an update that unfortunately, I won't be able to connect with you today for our admission process session due to unexpected tasks demanding my attention. Therefore, I'd like to propose rescheduling our session for tomorrow evening at 5:00 PM. Please let me know if this time works for you?
26/09/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening the time is ok sir
27/09/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Precious. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
27/09/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir
27/09/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/09/23, 5:49 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm ready sir but it seems the network is bad . Let's try
27/09/23, 5:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
27/09/23, 6:43 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Understood sir
03/10/23, 5:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

*“Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, others make it happen.” – Michael Jordan*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
03/10/23, 5:18 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir.Thank you for the wonderful quote.lm available sir
03/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. I am happy to hear that.
03/10/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
03/10/23, 5:34 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes l agree sir.One of the 3  options
03/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
03/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
03/10/23, 5:55 pm - +263 77 412 4684: It's very clear sir that will be a great idea
03/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that.
03/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
03/10/23, 6:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
03/10/23, 6:15 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Very clear sir that will be very wise
03/10/23, 6:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,


3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career


Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
03/10/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm following sir
03/10/23, 7:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
03/10/23, 8:20 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Please revise the admission process and higher education costs
03/10/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know about that. It is alright, I am more than happy to help you recall and understand the process of the admission process. With that in mind, I will provide you with a detailed breakdown and summary of the process. So, if you are ready, may I proceed with this?
04/10/23, 5:38 am - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry sir couldn't proceed.Good morning
04/10/23, 4:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that cheerful note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

May I know if you are currently available at the moment to proceed with the session?
04/10/23, 4:47 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir we may proceed lm very free. Thank you for the quote
04/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. The main focus of our university admission process is completing your scholarship application and sharing it with endorsed universities. Edoofa will submit your application to multiple universities, which will evaluate your eligibility in a day or two. If eligible, you'll receive an offer letter with scholarship details, tuition fees, accommodation costs, and registration fees. If multiple universities accept your application, you can't practically study at all of them.
04/10/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You must make a crucial decision among the various offer letters you receive, considering factors like university exposure, ranking, and affordability. After choosing a university, you need to reserve your scholarship seat by paying a registration fee, typically $500 to $750, within two to four weeks of receiving the offer letter. This fee is considered part of the first-year tuition for Edoofa Program students and should be paid in your home country to secure the seat. Are we clear here?
04/10/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Very clear sir thank you
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. You are qualified for a scholarship through Edoofa, reducing your annual education cost in India to $2000 to $3000, covering tuition, food, accommodation, and other expenses. Let's use an example to explain the registration process. If your chosen university has the following fees:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per year
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per year
Registration Fee: $750 (due within two weeks)
04/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The total fee would be a Tuition Fee of $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee of $1000 = $2800 per year. To reserve your scholarship seat, you pay the $750 registration fee, which is adjusted to your first-year fee, making it $2800 - $750 = $2050. You can pay this in two installments of $1025 each, with the first due within the first three days of your arrival in India. The remaining balance can be paid in monthly installments for financial flexibility and on-time payments. Please let me know if you are clear here.
04/10/23, 5:51 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Its clear sir but the instalments are too big  and unaffordable
04/10/23, 6:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that please do not worry about that right now the above numbers are just an assumption for your understanding the exact details and numbers will be presented on the offer letter shared by the universities. May I know if you are clear now?
04/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Well it's clear sir thank you
04/10/23, 8:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Upon successfully paying the registration fee, your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account will be linked to the university's fee account. This allows you to use your EWYL credits to offset your annual university fees, providing you with financial flexibility throughout your education.

Additionally, after the registration fee payment, you will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, which is crucial for securing admission and obtaining your student visa. If you have any questions about the admission process or the associated costs for your higher education, please feel free to ask.
04/10/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Understood sir thank you
04/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

As Precious's guardian, I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that Precious is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
05/10/23, 6:57 am - +263 77 412 4684: Good morning sir yes sir lm looking for
05/10/23, 6:57 am - +263 77 412 4684: Forward for that
05/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student. 

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
05/10/23, 6:03 pm - +263 77 412 4684: We're very fine sir how are you
05/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. I am doing well too, thank you for asking.
05/10/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for Precious's application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
05/10/23, 6:13 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I will greatly appreciate that sir.Thank you for walking this journey so far.May God bless you for your wonderful job.
05/10/23, 6:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

I wish you a blessed and productive day ahead, and please convey my regards to your family as well. If you ever need any assistance or have further questions, please don't hesitate to reach out.
05/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you very much Sir great your family too
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious!
I hope you all are doing well. 

I am Mr. Milan, Senior Admission Officer here at Edoofa, and today, I have some incredible news to share with you all! After you gave the admissions team the green light to proceed with your university application process, the team worked on processing your application accordingly. And, I'm thrilled to inform you that the university application process has been a success and you have received a prestigious offer from Galgotias University. Congratulations on this incredible achievement. 🌟✨🎓
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: The University will be mailing you the letter shortly, since we received the letter early, we are sharing it with you here. Take your time to review the letter and then once you are done going through it, we will then have a discussion about the letter in detail and address any questions or concerns you may have tomorrow at 12.00 PM CAT. Congratulations on this prestigious offer and securing a scholarship! Your hard work has truly paid off! ⭐🌟
09/10/23, 9:45 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 1:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As you can see in your offer letter, you also have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with your registration fee due as well?
10/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 412 4684: It's clear sir
10/10/23, 1:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, moving ahead, the one-time Admission and Procedure Fee of $300 has been graciously waived due to the Early Registration Scheme. This brings us to the Registration Fee, which stands at $750. To reserve your scholarship seat, this fee is crucial. Are we good so far?
10/10/23, 1:33 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good sir
10/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
10/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 23rd October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 23rd November 2023.* <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 1:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *23rd October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir l would try the first two parts
10/10/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign	 currency exchange bank account.
10/10/23, 1:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I reside in Gweru but l have Precious'  father stays near Harare .Some 30 km from Harare
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you  sir  l will do such
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: You are most welcome. Alternatively, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 11% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes sir please share
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Account Holder - Charles Jerera
Account Number - 5333 0380 1404 8828
Bank Name - FBC Bank Limited 
Branch - Masvingo
10/10/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir but the last time l deposited the money they were saying one of his account number reverses money.Is this not the account because it's a different one from the one l usually use.
10/10/23, 9:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, that is right. The details that I have shared with you are the updated details please. Hence, you do not have to worry about that. I hope this is clear?
11/10/23, 11:57 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well.

I want to express my gratitude for your patience today, as I was unavailable for our discussion. Moving ahead, I'm pleased to inform you that starting tomorrow at 09:30 AM CAT, we'll be holding scheduled sessions. During these sessions, we'll address any concerns or questions you may have and plan the next steps in your admission journey.

Your active participation in these sessions is highly valuable therefore, we will connect with each other here tomorrow at the scheduled time. Have a pleasant night!
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well.

Following our earlier conversation, I believe you and your family must be very excited about the opportunity you have received from Galgotias University. Receiving the offer letter from the university is undoubtedly a momentous occasion, and I can only imagine the enthusiasm that must have filled your days as you eagerly awaited its arrival.

Moving ahead, have you had the chance to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a family yet?
16/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir we discussed and it's disheartening because Precious' father has concluded that he can't afford any of the money needed right now so lm cancelling the offer because l alone can't afford it
16/10/23, 3:25 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, can you plase help me in understanding about what are the exact challenges that are causing you to not being able to afford the same?
16/10/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm not employed and Precious'father has another wife but he is working as a teacher who earns less than $300 a month.So he is saying it's difficult to raise such an amount yet he has a family to feed
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, on that note, I believe the main concern is the total higher education costs for Precious that you are finding to bear, right?

On that note, if the costs would be a bit lower I am sure you would not face any difficulty in moving ahead with her higher education. Therefore, can you please let me know how much amount is it that you are comfortable in bearing for Precious's higher education per annum?
17/10/23, 1:46 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir right now l can't give you a figure.Let me discuss with Precious' father.
17/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please let me know of the same so that I can then help you in plannig the way ahead.
17/10/23, 4:49 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you sir
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263774124684 May I know if you were able to have a discussion with Precious's father by now and discuss about moving ahead with her admission process please?
18/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry sir was not on app.He said he could only manage $600 per annum
18/10/23, 5:52 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon
19/10/23, 9:13 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
19/10/23, 9:15 am - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to get a clarity on the same that if you wish to say that you can only afford to pay $600 per year for Precious's higher education, is that so?
19/10/23, 11:20 am - +263 77 412 4684: Good morning sir that's correct sir that's what l was told
19/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask are you certain about the same, since I believe that he may have wanted to let you know about the registration fee, right?
20/10/23, 4:56 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry sir had no data . I'm not getting your question sir.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 8:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Here I was trying to say that if it is possible that Precious's father was mentioning about $600 that he will be able to raise for Precious's registration instead of per annum. I believe there is some sort of misunderstanding, right?
20/10/23, 11:23 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening sir that was per annum amount.Thats what he told me
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
23/10/23, 10:15 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Now, on that note, if you are mentioning that you can only afford to raise $600 for Precious's higher education, then I believe that you won't be able to proceed with her higher education with such costs even in Zimbabwe, right?
23/10/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir. Yes sir that is what l have on the ground l don't know what l can do.
25/10/23, 12:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Precious!
I hope you are having a good day.

30/10/23, 7:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious!

30/10/23, 7:10 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, I understand your concern and the challenge you're facing in meeting the required fees for Precious's education. It's disheartening to hear about the obstacles you're encountering, however, in this journey of yours, you can stay assured that we are here to help you, only if you yourself are willing to move ahead with Precious's higher education. Now, on the same note, can you please help me in understanding more about your plans to proceed with her admission process?
01/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening sir.
01/11/23, 10:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Precious. It's quite unfortunate to hear about your recent illness. Please take care and focus on getting well soon.

02/11/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
02/11/23, 1:55 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263774124684 I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discsussion here. May I know by when should we reconnect with each other here for continuing with the same?
02/11/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Sorry sir we have electricity problems so out network is giving us problems too lthink we can try now .Let's talk

02/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Right now there is no solid plan we don't have the money
02/11/23, 8:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: I completely understand the challenges you're facing. Your situation regarding the fees for Precious's education is quite complex. Have you explored any alternative options or potential sources that might assist in securing the required funds?
02/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening sir l have tried to look for sponsors but lm failing to get any.lm left with no option
03/11/23, 11:05 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.
03/11/23, 11:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, on that note, I understand your situation, and I went ahead to have a discussion with the academic board about the same, and there is a possible option that may help you in making sure that your higher education journey remains uninterrupted by providing you with a chance to pursue the same course at one of our partner universities for significantly low costs as compared to Galgotias. Now, would you be interested in exploring that opportunity please?
03/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good afternoon sir.We are very much willing for your option .lThank you very much for keeping remembering us
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Precious!
I hope you are doing well today.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you in the admissions group since last Friday. Unexpectedly, my schedule became quite busy, and the weekend turned out to be quite hectic, which made it challenging for us to respond during that time.
06/11/23, 11:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Additionally, I've noticed that for some time now, our communication has been hindered by various factors such as time constraints, network issues, and other unforeseen circumstances. To ensure a more consistent connection going forward, starting tomorrow, we'll establish a regular time for our discussions at 05:30 PM CAT. This dedicated time will allow us to thoroughly address any pending discussions and smoothly progress with the admission process. On that note, I will connect with you tomorrow at 05.30 PM, until then, have a blessed evening ahead.
07/11/23, 1:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Thank you l will be available

07/11/23, 5:50 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Good evening sir the time is good we can move on.
07/11/23, 5:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Before we move ahead, I would like to ask, how was your day?

07/11/23, 6:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that your day went well. Mine was productive, thank you for asking. Now, regarding your situation, I've been exploring options to ensure that Precious's higher education journey continues seamlessly. I'm glad to know you're open to considering alternatives.
07/11/23, 6:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, when it comes to the alternate option that we had discussed about, when we will plan to go for that, the per annum expenses for Precious's higher education would total to around $1600-$2000 per annum. Now, what are your thoughts on the same?
07/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 412 4684: Yes sir l opt for anything for my daughter's education.
07/11/23, 6:28 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I will try to look for the money that's much better Sir
07/11/23, 6:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, can you please let me know that if you are comfortable with the above mentioned fee range, shall we go-ahead and follow up on Precious's application with the universities and see about what is the earliest that the offer letter can be arranged?
07/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 77 412 4684: I'm comfortable sir let's try and see what l can get
07/11/23, 6:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, let us assume that you have received the offer letter from that university tomorrow, and are required to pay the admission fee to secure the seat, by when do you think you would be able to raise and pay the admission fee for securing the spot?
07/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 412 4684: How much will we be talking about sir.I would say by end of month.
07/11/23, 8:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I would like to mention that the registration fee will only be mentioned in the offer letter, however, as you have mentioned that you would be able to pay that by the end of the month, can you please help me in understanding more about how much amount are you planning to raise by then?
07/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 412 4684: At least $300 only
