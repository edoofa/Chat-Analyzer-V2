However, before starting, I would like to know how are you and your family doing and how have you utilized your past few months to plan for Purity's higher education?

07/09/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted
07/09/23, 2:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Since you mentioned that your first priority is Civil engineering, then may I know why is that you are inclined toward Medicine?
07/09/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 298 0023: It's not Purity but her father. India is regarded as one of the countries which produces best medical doctors or medical personal
07/09/23, 2:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, indeed it is true @263772980023, however, may I know if you have had a discussion with Purity regarding the same, is she also inclined towards medicine or she is interested in Civil Engineering as her first priority?
07/09/23, 2:51 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Will ask her .
07/09/23, 5:27 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Let's deal with Civil engineering. It was just out of my interest. Others all is alright .
07/09/23, 8:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Ok
07/09/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes I remember

09/09/23, 7:48 am - +263 77 239 3437: Good morning.please note, Sabbath starts Friday sunset and it ends Saturday sunset,so we will not be available even today and every other Saturdays until evening.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
09/09/23, 2:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you're having a wonderful afternoon. I apologize for not being able to engage further as I'm feeling a bit under the weather. 

As the weekend is approaching, let's plan to reconnect on Monday to continue our session. I wish you a fantastic weekend, and please convey my warm regards to your family.
09/09/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Thank you.
17/09/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Purity.

I trust this message finds you all in good health. I extend my apologies for my recent absence, as I have been under the weather. I am pleased to inform you that I am now on the road to recovery, and I am eager to reconnect with you. I have scheduled our discussion for tomorrow, Monday, at 03:00 PM. I understand that your schedules can be quite hectic, but I believe that dedicating just one hour of your time will be worthwhile. Due to my ongoing recovery, connecting in the evening will not be feasible for me.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Your active participation during this time slot would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to our upcoming conversation and I hope you had a great weekend.
19/09/23, 6:09 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Greetings.
I was looking forward to our discussion yesterday at 3pm.
19/09/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening parents and Purity,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Kindly excuse me for not connecting with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow at 02.30 P.M. I hope this time works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 9:07 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 9:08 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Oh nice.
19/09/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 239 3437: 2:30 tomorrow will be fine.
07/10/23, 9:48 am - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
07/10/23, 9:50 am - Kirti Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Purity.

I hope this message finds each of you in good health. I want to apologize for my recent absence and my inability to connect with you. I've been unwell, but I'm glad to report that I'm now on the path to recovery and looking forward to reconnecting with all of you. Are you currently available to connect with us?
07/10/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Good afternoon.Sorry we are not available today as it is the Sabbath.
07/10/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand that May I know if you will be able to connect on Monday?
07/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you on Monday to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening and a great weekend ahead.
09/10/23, 6:00 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Purity.

I hope you are doing well, I was hoping to get a response from you, however, you did not respond, may I know if you are facing any challenges, since I noticed that you were able to go through my message?
09/10/23, 6:24 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Sincerest apologies. We were very busy with related issue
09/10/23, 7:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No need to apologize at all. I understand that life can get busy, and other priorities may take precedence from time to time.  May I know if you are available to connect with us now?
09/10/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes, available now
09/10/23, 7:46 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 7:48 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes that's true
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
09/10/23, 7:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
09/10/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes,I understand
09/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Noted
09/10/23, 8:09 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Understood
09/10/23, 8:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
09/10/23, 8:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
09/10/23, 8:35 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted but how long should one make this payment. I mean timeframe. This year we have much to meet on our children's fees . Is it possible to make payments early next year
09/10/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Or any time before one comes to India
09/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 239 3437: This message was deleted
09/10/23, 8:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand your concern completely, @263772980023 however, I would like you to be patient please, as we move ahead with our discussion all your queries will be covered. I hope we are clear?
09/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Let's go
09/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
09/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Go ahead
09/10/23, 8:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

*I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
09/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes.Noted
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
09/10/23, 9:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted
09/10/23, 9:43 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
09/10/23, 9:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
09/10/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Go ahead
09/10/23, 9:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
09/10/23, 9:59 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Kindly advise how much one is going to pay to complete the degree with scholarship.
09/10/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Any chances of getting 100% scholarship through Edoofa
09/10/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, let me help you understand as you might be aware, that the Edoofa scholarship program offers *50% to 100%* scholarships. However, to get such a high quantum of scholarship the university has some criteria that the student should have extremely great merits in their A, and O Levels, co-curricular actives, and Edoofa's recommendation too. Plus you even have the EWYL Program to learn and earn and further reduce your cost by earning credits. 

I hope we are clear here?
09/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Does that mean you are required to pay the above money on yearly basis until one finished his or her program
09/10/23, 10:05 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted kindly advise great merits you consider
09/10/23, 10:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, as stated above while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. The remaining balance can be paid once the student arrives in India.
09/10/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely, great merits would be a certification from the school, a recommendation letter from the school, etc, etc.
09/10/23, 10:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I was hoping to get a response from your end to complete our discussion, however, it seems like you are currently unavailable. 

As it has been a long day for me and our available hours for today are over, I will reconnect with you tomorrow at 12:30 pm to resume our discussion. I hope this time works for you and that you will be available for our scheduled session. Wish you a good evening. <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
10/10/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Purity, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
10/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Ok.noted
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
10/10/23, 1:39 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes, resonating well.thank you
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
10/10/23, 1:52 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
10/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes.please go ahead
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
10/10/23, 2:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 25, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 25, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 25, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
10/10/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 239 3437: What happens in event that this money is not available at the deadline.
10/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Please note I will not be available online as from 15:00 hrs.I have work to attend to at that time.
10/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, I completely understand that work commitments are also important. May I know why do you think that you will not be able to pay the registration fee within the deadline?
10/10/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 298 0023: We have an obligations of payment of fees for Purity and my son who is finish his under grad degree. So we my not be able to meet your  deadline <This message was edited>
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Asking just in case that happens
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, in that case, the university shall revoke the offer letter, however, in certain cases, and under consideration, and discussion with the Academic Board after which the university may allow some extension.
10/10/23, 2:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
10/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Please provide more information.
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Surely let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
10/10/23, 2:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge movement.
10/10/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Quite understood.thank you for the information.
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
10/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 239 3437: True
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
10/10/23, 2:55 pm - +263 77 239 3437: Yes,agreed
10/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
10/10/23, 2:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
10/10/23, 5:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772393437 @263772980023 may I know if we are still connected with each other?
10/10/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 239 3437: May we please connect again tomorrow
10/10/23, 7:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772393437 I understand that you must be occupied with work, however, if you are actively present the discussion will hardly take 30 minutes of your time now.
10/10/23, 9:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: @263772980023 may I know if we are connected with each other?
10/10/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 298 0023: What time
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am sorry I did not get you well here, could you please help me understand better?
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 298 0023: I mean now
10/10/23, 9:16 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Available if it's now
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes please, if you are available we can still connect and continue where we left our discussion
10/10/23, 9:17 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. So may I know if you are clear so far?
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her/his interest in August 2024 itself.
10/10/23, 9:18 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
10/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Clear
10/10/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted
10/10/23, 9:23 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
10/10/23, 9:28 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Following
10/10/23, 9:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As Purity's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Purity is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
10/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Yes
10/10/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
10/10/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Thank you very much
10/10/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome, thank you for your time have a blessed night.
10/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Blessed night too
14/10/23, 9:40 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Purity.

Please be prepared with any questions or concerns you may have, and we will address them during our discussion. Looking forward to our conversation tomorrow. Have a pleasant evening ahead.
15/10/23, 9:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Purity!

How are you doing today? May I know if you have been able to go through your offer letter from Galgotias University by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Purity!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side here earlier so that we could have moved ahead with our discussion regarding your offer letter. May I know by when can we connect with each other here for the same?
16/10/23, 11:30 am - +263 77 298 0023: Greetings and morning.
16/10/23, 11:32 am - +263 77 298 0023: Sorry we have been very busy. On Saturday it's our Sabbath and yesterday was visiting day for Purity . She will starting writing her final A level tomorrow until 15 November. Our apologies
16/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 298 0023: May you kindly explain the offer letter you sent and 50% scholarship. The 15 days period given us . <This message was edited>
16/10/23, 11:34 am - +263 77 298 0023: Is that the only university offer letter coming her way ??
16/10/23, 11:49 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss about all of that moving ahead. For now, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter please?
16/10/23, 11:50 am - +263 77 298 0023: Yes gone through it though need more explanations
16/10/23, 11:51 am - +263 77 298 0023: Yes is reference to all those questions l asked you . Is it so??
16/10/23, 12:06 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. Now, I'm delighted to hear that you've reviewed the offer letter from Galgotias University. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I'd like you to take another look at the offer letter to ensure we're all on the same page. Could you please provide the following details?

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4. What's your Registration fee?
16/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 298 0023: 1.....$1000

2......4yrs


3......$300

4.....$750
16/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Scholarship is for tution only kindly elaborate or both
16/10/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please. As you can see in the offer letter, the scholarship has been offered on the tuition fee please. Now, since accommodation is considered as a personal expense of the student, the scholarship does not cover the same. I hope this is clear?
16/10/23, 3:37 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Noted
16/10/23, 3:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, Galgotias University is one of the universities that never pushes students when it comes to accommodation facilities since it is crucial for them to be comfortable in the environment to focus and give their best. The university rather asks them to visit the campus, check for themselves, and then decide whether he/she want to stay inside or outside the campus.

I hope we are together so far?
19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Purity!

Due to time differences, we have not been able to have a proper discussion regarding your offer letter in the past few days. Therefore, I would like to schedule our conversation for 08:30 PM tonight so that we can have an uninterrupted session to complete our discussion about the offer letter. This will allow us to move forward with the next steps in your admission process.

I hope that you will be available for the session at the mentioned time!
19/10/23, 8:44 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Again Parents and Purity!

I am glad to reconnect with you here and together we will make sure that your higher education journey is well planned from here. Now, may I know if you are now ready for our scheduled session please?
20/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Greetings sorry l was attending funeral in rural areas. The network is bad
20/10/23, 2:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please dear, I understand that. I am sorry to hear that you had to go to a funeral, if I may ask who is it that we lost?
20/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 298 0023: My church elder
20/10/23, 2:39 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry to hear about the loss of your church elder. Please accept my condolences. It's completely understandable that you had other important matters to attend to.
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, on that note, if I may ask, are you comfortable in moving ahead with the discussion here now?
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Thank you
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 298 0023: How long will it take
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: It will take around half an hour dear, are you ready for that?
20/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Today will be busy will drive away soon sorry about that
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, by when shall we connect with each other here?

20/10/23, 3:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please.
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Purity!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 10:05 am - Milan Edoofa: It's great to hear that your daughter has a background of boarding at an Adventist school. This experience will surely help her adapt well to the university's accommodation options, whether she chooses on-campus or off-campus living. 

Moving ahead, Galgotias University believes that a conducive environment is essential for students to excel in their studies. Instead of imposing a particular choice, the university encourages students to personally visit the campus, explore the available accommodation options, and make a decision that best suits their needs, whether it's on-campus or off-campus housing.

I trust this clarifies the university's approach?
25/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 77 298 0023: How far is it from the Capital.
25/10/23, 10:08 am - Milan Edoofa: Galgotias University is conveniently located in Greater Noida, which is a well-planned city in the National Capital Region (NCR) of India. It's approximately 40-45 kilometers from the capital city, New Delhi. The proximity to the national capital ensures that students have easy access to various resources, including cultural, educational, and professional opportunities, which makes it a desirable destination for higher education. I hope this is clear?
25/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 298 0023: So far you have given her  this one option. Is it the only one that she has been offered the place
25/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 77 298 0023: Clear sir
25/10/23, 10:41 am - +263 77 298 0023: Are you there sir
25/10/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, before we delve into the specific details of these universities and their responses, it's essential to make sure you are familiar with the admission process. So, are you aware of how the admission process is carried out?
25/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 77 298 0023: Kindly explain more on these admission processes
25/10/23, 10:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you in understanding how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
25/10/23, 10:55 am - +263 77 298 0023: Clear sir
25/10/23, 10:56 am - +263 77 298 0023: The scholarship is it offered by the university or the Edoofa scholarship kindly clarify here.
25/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 298 0023: Edoofa scholarship is based on merit okay
25/10/23, 10:59 am - +263 77 298 0023: When will you consider the A level results say a person has 12-15 A level points .??
25/10/23, 11:03 am - Milan Edoofa: I appreciate your question, and it's an important distinction to clarify. The scholarships are offered by the universities themselves. Edoofa is partnered with some of the top universities here in India, and our role is to help our students gain access to these scholarships. We assist students in the application process, provide guidance, and connect them with these universities. I hope this is clear now?
25/10/23, 11:04 am - Milan Edoofa: When it comes to considering the A-Level Results, once they will arrive the universities will collect the results from the students and will conduct a reevaluation of the scholarship percentage based on the results, and then the final scholarship will be offered on the basis of that please. I hope this is clear as well?
25/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 298 0023: Thank you
25/10/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 298 0023: Noted getting clearer and clearer
25/10/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Moving ahead, as of now, your application has been only accepted by Galgotias University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
25/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 77 298 0023: Very much clear sir .
25/10/23, 12:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by Galgotias, you would lose out on the scholarship from Galgotias and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Not aware sir
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship.
25/10/23, 4:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
25/10/23, 4:16 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Maybe the period you gave for one to register is short because 750 is a lot of money considering the timeframe given is very short. The student will come on August 2024
25/10/23, 4:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I understand that time frame might seem short to you, however, you are not looking at the financial benefits that you are getting here. Firstly, you are getting a grant of $150, and then you are also getting a payment plan of 45 days. 

Moving ahead, while doing the standard admission process, you only get 15 days to pay off the whole $750 registration fee. Now, on that note, which option do you think is much better?
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Kindly explain further
25/10/23, 4:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, if I may ask, what you you wish to know more from this, since I believe you are already aware of the Endowment Program Benefits, right?
25/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 77 298 0023: I mean grant of 150 and 45 days maybe l missed it
25/10/23, 4:23 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Is not that you required to pay 750 within 15 days after the offer letter from University
25/10/23, 4:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: @263772980023 I believe we have been discussing this for a while, however, let me help you in understanding the same here again. 

With the Endowment Plan Benefits, you get a total of 45 days to pay the registration fee with $150 Grant. In this case, you get to pay the first part of the registration fee in 15 days, and the second part within a month from the first part, essentially it making a payment plan of 45 days. I hope this is clear now?
25/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Thanks so how much is paid within 15 days <This message was edited>
25/10/23, 4:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we are coming to discuss that, but before, that, can you please let me know if you are clear till here as well?
25/10/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 298 0023: Kindly advise me
25/10/23, 4:51 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please Mr. Phiri, as I mentioned here we are coming to discuss that, but before that, can you please let me know if you are clear till here please?

01/12/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 684 4623: Ok sir 
I don't think I am passionate about the career that I chose from the beginning I can safely say that was pressure I got from those who were successful in the field🤷🏼‍♀️
01/12/23, 9:17 am - +263 71 684 4623: What I'm interested in is medicine or software engineering or robotics engineering  
Especially medicine
01/12/23, 9:20 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here please. Now, if I am right, the course that you are currently enrolled into is B.Tech (Civil Engineering), right?

01/12/23, 9:24 am - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. On that note, may you please let me know about the reason that you wish to pursue the course Medicine or even Software Engineering?
01/12/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 684 4623: I like helping the suffering patients
And that has been my dream since I was small 
I would love to open my hospitals and clinics so that people receive treatment on time 
In my country it has been a challenge that people are crowded in hospitals and clinics as many of them cannot afford private hospitals due to their high bills
It is my dream that once I understand everything in medicine I open my own hospitals and clinics that are affordable
01/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 684 4623: Also nowadays some doctors  do not treat patients like the real problem but just focus on suppressing the pain 
I would love to be a doctor who treats the real problem
01/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 71 684 4623: As for software 
The world is going there in 5 to 10 years to come most of the jobs will be elliminated because of technology 
I would love to be part of the team creating and developing things to make it easier for our generation and the coming generations
01/12/23, 12:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the same with me here. Your interest in Software Engineering due to the potential for technological advancement and innovation is also significant. Have you ever explored any introductory courses or coding tutorials to see if it resonates with you?
01/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 684 4623: No

It has been quite some time since we were last able to connect with each other here, and I apologize for the delay in our communication. I got occupied with our students here in India for some campus activities, which led to this delay. I truly appreciate your patience during this time.

In order for us to continue our discussion and address any pending matters, I propose scheduling our next discussion for 03:30 PM tomorrow. I hope this time is suitable for you. Thank you for your understanding.
