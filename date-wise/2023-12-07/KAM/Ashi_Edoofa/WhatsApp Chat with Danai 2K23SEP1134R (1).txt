02/12/23, 8:29 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -
02/12/23, 8:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
02/12/23, 8:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.
02/12/23, 8:30 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these two steps are clear?
02/12/23, 8:31 am - +263 78 154 2433: They are
02/12/23, 8:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps-
02/12/23, 8:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
02/12/23, 8:32 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.
02/12/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 154 2433: Can i ask questions now or after explaining all the steps
02/12/23, 8:33 am - Ashi Edoofa: Let me share all the steps with you dear and then you can go ahead with your concern, is that okay?
02/12/23, 8:33 am - +263 78 154 2433: Okay
02/12/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 154 2433: Proceed to the last 2 steps
02/12/23, 8:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of *$500 to $750.* Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL). <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 8:36 am - Ashi Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.
02/12/23, 8:37 am - Ashi Edoofa: I hope these are clear as well?
02/12/23, 8:37 am - +263 78 154 2433: Thank you

02/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 154 2433: I wanted to ask about the qualities of an EDOOFIAN
02/12/23, 8:40 am - Ashi Edoofa: I am happy to see that you are interested in knowing the qualities of edoofians. For the same the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life.

04/12/23, 12:07 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Haven't viewed them yet. As i said they require a lot of network that's the problem i am having now. But I'll let you know when I've viewed them
04/12/23, 12:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know Danai, as you have mentioned that you were not able to view the videos due to network challenges hence, I would like to suggest that first you can download all the videos we have shared with you and then you can watch them so that you can go through the videos without any interruption.

04/12/23, 9:26 pm - +27 62 906 9831: Good evening.

I have watched the videos and will be ready for the next session at 1300hrs today <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 12:28 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Danai, I hope you are doing well. 

I am pleased to know that you were able to go through all the videos. If you don't mind, could you please share your understanding of all four videos with me so that I can assist you in expanding upon them and help you ensure you are on the right path in your educational journey?
05/12/23, 12:32 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I understood that there is need for a Statement of purpose. This is to be submitted to universities that are under EDOOFA so thatthe know why I am worthy of admission in their university
05/12/23, 12:33 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed you are right about the SOP dear, May I know your understanding about rest of the videos?
05/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Also it is important to listen and understand carefully all instructions given by the admission team. This way it won't be hard getting admitted
05/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 78 154 2433: This is also important because the team will know your skills and abilities for the program you desire
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright @263781542433. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
05/12/23, 1:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
05/12/23, 1:09 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes i understand
05/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes i understood thank you
05/12/23, 1:14 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome dear, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
05/12/23, 1:20 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Indeed we are
05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing, Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 1:00 PM.
05/12/23, 1:21 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

05/12/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I would like to ask each question from 2-5 should be answered each with 150-200 words or it means all of them should sum up to 150-200 words
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand that for each question the word limit is 150-200 words please.
05/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay thank you

Once you share these documents and complete the two tasks that have been provided to you, we will have completed the second step of your university admission process. At that point, we will be prepared to move on to the third step, which involves understanding the registration process. Could you kindly confirm when you will be able to complete these tasks and reconnect with us? This will allow us to schedule our discussion accordingly.
05/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Tomorrow by 1:00pm
05/12/23, 3:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. In that case, we will be concluding the conversation for now and we will reconnect tomorrow at 1:00 pm for our next session. 

I hope by then you will be able to fill out all the forms. If you have any queries or concerns before then, feel free to share them here in your admission group. Wish you a blessed day and please ensure to extend our regards to your family as well.
05/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 78 154 2433: One more question...

Goodbye for now

06/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Good afternoon Edoofa
06/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 154 2433: I am ready to submit my responses for the documents you sent yesterday
06/12/23, 1:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Danai, Wishing you a good day!

Thank you for letting me know dear, Please share your response with us.
06/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: *Question 2: What is the reason for short sightedness? How can it be corrected*

Some people are born with this condition while others develop it overtime. Generally, myopia is caused by the eye bieng too long from front to back or by the cornea and/or lens bieng too curved. This causes the light entering the eye to focus infront of the retina instead of directly in it which results in blurry vision. There are also a number of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that can increase one's risk of developing myopia. On the genetics side, having a parent or sibling with myopia increases one's risk of developing it. Environmental factors include, excessive near work (such as , reading or using digital devices). Some lifestyle factors that have been linked to myopia include spending less time outdoors and having a diet low in antioxidants. 
There are several ways to correct myopia. The most common way is using eyeglasses or contact lenses that have a prescription designed to correct the refractive mirror. In some cases , laser surgery such as, LASIK can be used. Depending on the severity of the condition, orthokeratology which involves wearing special rigid contact lenses at night to reshape the cornea can also be an option.
06/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: *Question 3: What is you opinion of LASIK surgery. Do you think it is a cosmetic or medically corrective procedure?And can it be used on someone with retinal defect , why or why not?*



LASIK surgery is definitely a medical procedure, not a cosmetic one. It's considered to be a refractive surgery, which is a procedure that's performed to correct refractive errors in the eye. In LASIK, a laser is used to reshape the cornea, which changes the way light enters the eye and helps to correct the refractive error. While it's true that LASIK can improve a person's appearance by removing the need for glasses or contacts, it's primarily performed for its medical benefits. LASIK surgery is also generally expensive. It is considered to be an out -of-pocket expense that is not typically covered by insurance.Generally, LASIK is not recommended for people with certain types of retinal diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa or macular degeneration. This is because LASIK can sometimes make retinal diseases worse. Retinal diseases can also increase the risk of complications from LASIK, such as vision loss or retinal detachment. It's important to talk to your eye doctor about any retinal diseases you may have, so that they can help you determine if LASIK is a safe option for someone with retinal defect.
06/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: *Question 4: Explain the techniques to maintain good eyesight.*

There are a number of to things that one can do to maintain good eye health and prevent vision loss. Firstly, it is important to have regular eye exams with an optician so that any potential problems can be detected and treated early. In addition, eating a healthy diet especially including more antioxidants and vitamins in your diet helps maintain good eyesight. Limiting screen time and taking regular breaks from digital devices is another way. And if you spend a lot of time on a computer or other digital devices, make sure to follow the 20-20-20  rule (every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds). This helps relax the eyes and prevent eye strain. To add on, drinking a lot of water keeps the eyes hydrated hence prevent dry eyes. Also, one should wear sunglasses and a hat when in the sun beacause UV rays can be a threat to eyesight. Reducing stress and getting enough sleep should be practiced to maintain good vision. Lastly , avoid rubbing eyes as this can damage the delicate eye tissues and also hands contain bacteria. Hence along with this , one should practice regular hand washing.
06/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: *Question 5: Explain what causes lazy eye syndrome especially in kids*

Lazy eye syndrome, also known as amblyopia is condition where one eye doesn't develop normal vision. In the children, this is usually caused by an imbalance in the way the eyes send signals to the brain , this leads to the brain ignoring signals from the weaker eye. Lazy eye is most common in children under the age of seven. These little kids are at greater risk of developing amblyopia , also known as lzy eye syndrome because their eyes are still developing and are more sensitive to visual disruption because of their delicacy. Kids also mostly get amblyopia because they are most pron to refractive errors such as near sightedness or far sightedness which lead to development of amblyopia. Lastly, kids may develop lazy eye due to cataracts, which are cloudy areas in the lens of the child's eye. These block light from reaching the retina. Other less common causes of lazy eye syndrome are albinism, optic nerve problems and certain eye tumours.
06/12/23, 1:06 pm - +263 78 154 2433: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:09 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your response with us Danai, Before we start our today's session May I know if you have completed the SOP form?
06/12/23, 1:28 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Not yet
06/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: May I know the reason dear, are you facing any challenge in completing the form?
06/12/23, 1:32 pm - +263 78 154 2433: The network here isn't strong enough to reach the internet and so I'll let you know when I've completed the SOP
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright dear, Please make sure to share the confirmation with us once you complete the form.
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay thank you
06/12/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263781542433. Before we proceed to the next stage, I'd like to assist you in getting started with your EWYL Journey. Based on your EWYL application form, you are scheduled to commence your EWYL journey on Friday (8-Dec-2023).
06/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With your intention and commencement date in mind, we have already communicated this information to the EWYL team. They are prepared to initiate your EWYL program on Friday, as previously agreed upon.

To kickstart the process, your dedicated EWYL Mentor has established your EWYL Group and shared the invitation link with us. Here's what you and your parents need to do:

https://chat.whatsapp.com/CEhgMVbC9IpGUsHaniWKL8
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Use the provided link to join your group. Once both you and your parents have joined, please send the following message to the group:

*Dear Mentor, my name is Danai Mapfumo, and my EWYL group name is Danai EWYL23E0751. I am excited to begin my EWYL Journey. As discussed with the admission team, I am committed to being available on Friday (8-Dec-2023) to commence the procedures. Kindly schedule my session for the same date so that I can maximize the benefits and start on the right track.*
06/12/23, 1:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you start with the EWYL Program and are able to connect with your mentor, please update the same here as well by sending the below message -

*Hello Admission officer, I am now in touch with my EWYL Mentor. The name of my Mentor is _________ and he/she has scheduled my session for ________*(mention the date)
06/12/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Okay sure
06/12/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Alright, Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*.

Once again to confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is *Bachelor of Optometry* and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
06/12/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes it is
06/12/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
06/12/23, 1:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
06/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
06/12/23, 1:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
06/12/23, 1:49 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes of course
06/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
06/12/23, 1:55 pm - Ashi Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
06/12/23, 1:56 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Ashi Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes we are
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:

Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
06/12/23, 2:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
06/12/23, 2:12 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes please
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/12/23, 6:11 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Greetings @263781542433May I know dear if we are on the same page?
06/12/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 154 2433: Yes we are
06/12/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know @263781542433. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
06/12/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted towards your annual university fees.
06/12/23, 6:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
06/12/23, 9:27 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263781542433I was waiting for your response here in your group, however, since it is past our available hours let us reconnect tomorrow at 01:00 pm. I hope you will be available so that we can have a discussion have a great night ahead.
