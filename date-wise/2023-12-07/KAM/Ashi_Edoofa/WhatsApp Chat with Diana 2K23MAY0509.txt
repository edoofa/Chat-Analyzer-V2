25/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I am doing well good afternoon
25/09/23, 3:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes l am ready
25/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
25/09/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok
25/09/23, 3:05 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes I remember
25/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
25/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I understood that we make a part payment towards registration as per deadlines and it is not an extra fee but will be part of tuition fee for the first year and also that the registration process into university will commence after August 2023
25/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 258 0809: And also the fee structures depends with university chosen
25/09/23, 3:46 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Also well informed that we receive the acceptance letter after paying the registration fee
25/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
25/09/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?
25/09/23, 4:10 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes following
25/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
25/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
25/09/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes am ready
25/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 258 0809: We really appreciate the good work
25/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
25/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
25/09/23, 4:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
25/09/23, 4:45 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes I have gone through them
25/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
25/09/23, 4:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will connect you with the Universities for an interactive session with them.

Upon completion, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees would be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa. I hope you are clear on this point?
25/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
25/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Thank you
26/09/23, 2:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you are doing well and blessed may I know if you are ready for the session for your admission process?
26/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Good afternoon yes am ready
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
26/09/23, 2:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes understood
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
26/09/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
26/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes understood
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
26/09/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 28, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 28, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 28, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
26/09/23, 3:02 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Well informed  am following
26/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 77 258 0809: So do we  have an option to choose a university or Edoofa does that for us
26/09/23, 3:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You have the option to choose the universities from the offer letters that you have received from the universities, and we will assist you in selecting the best one based on your preferences. May I know if this is clear to you?
26/09/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok very clear
26/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
26/09/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I would really need more information for sure
26/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
26/09/23, 3:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
26/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 258 0809: So the E is it equivalent to 1 point
26/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 258 0809: The rest understood
26/09/23, 3:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
26/09/23, 3:43 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok my question was on 6 points and 2 Alevel passes(2 E) where m saying if the student gets 2 Es is it a pass or they need at least 6 points at A level
26/09/23, 3:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me get this clear to you. In India, for a student to pursue higher education, they need to get at least 2 E grades (or A Level Passes) in their exams. If a student doesn't achieve this minimum requirement, it means they won't be able to pursue a bachelor's education, not just in India, but anywhere in the world.

So, to put it simply, meeting this minimum grade requirement is crucial for a student to continue their studies beyond high school, whether in India or abroad.
26/09/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Clear now
26/09/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In addition, in India, universities do not consider the eligibility criteria based on points but on passed subjects. May I know if we are clear here?
26/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok clear
26/09/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
26/09/23, 4:26 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok this is if the student fails to meet the criteria
26/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct. Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
26/09/23, 4:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes clear
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
26/09/23, 5:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
26/09/23, 5:11 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes following
26/09/23, 5:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
26/09/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok noted with thanks
26/09/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
26/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Not  at the moment
26/09/23, 6:00 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Is it ok if we continue tomorrow am now on my way to work on night shift
26/09/23, 6:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, we shall connect tomorrow for further process of our session.
27/09/23, 3:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
27/09/23, 3:12 pm - +263 77 258 0809: So far so good let's proceed
27/09/23, 3:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

14/10/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Noted
15/10/23, 9:53 am - +263 77 258 0809: A very good morning
15/10/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
15/10/23, 10:12 am - Milan Edoofa: May I know if we can move ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter now?
15/10/23, 10:29 am - +263 77 258 0809: Yes let go ahead
15/10/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 258 0809: We can proceed
15/10/23, 10:57 am - +263 77 258 0809: I seem to have lost  communication could be network issues
15/10/23, 10:59 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you have gone through your offer letter from the Gulzar Group of Institutes, I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have as well. In order to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1) What’s your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship as mentioned in the letter? 
2) What's your accommodation/hostel fee per year, as mentioned in the letter?
3) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 77 258 0809: Number1:1225 per annum
15/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 258 0809: Hostel is 1200
Registration is 750
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. As you can see in your offer letter from GGI, after the scholarship your per-annum tuition fee is $1225.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: For the first year, it's mandatory for students to opt for the on-campus hostel as their FRRO has to be done by the university, however, from the second year, if they wish, they can opt to get off-campus accommodation as by then they would also be familiar with the place and would have made a few friends.

Gulzar Group of Institutes considers safety as one of the most important priorities and for the students to have an affordable and comfortable stay at hostels, the universities have two types of rooms, and students can choose the one as per their preference. Let me brief you on the two categories of accommodation as well -
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: 1. Three Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a three-seater (three people staying together) hostel is $1250, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a three-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1250) = $2475.

2. Four Seater with Mess - The per annum fee for a Four -seater (four people staying together) hostel is $1000, the rooms are Air Conditioned and the food service is included in the fee as well. If you opt for a four-seater room, in this case, your per annum educational fee is ($1225 + $1000) = $2225.
16/10/23, 7:23 am - +263 77 258 0809: Ok noted with thanks good morning
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:28 am - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad you understand. Given the fact that there are two options for accommodation at Gulzar Group of Institutes, which category would you like to choose for yourself?
16/10/23, 11:35 am - +263 77 258 0809: We would choose the 4 seater
16/10/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 258 0809: So the rooms are the same except for number of people?
16/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please dear, the rooms are almost the same, just the size it a bit bigger to accommodate 4 people. Moving ahead, You can surely opt for that option. I also want to inform you that one can easily upgrade or downgrade their accommodation after coming to India, the option will stay open for them.
16/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: In this case, as you want to opt for four-seater accommodation, your per annum fee is $2225 which can be paid in two parts of $1113 & $1112 at a gap of 6 months and can be reduced with the help of the EWYL Program as well as much you want.
16/10/23, 11:53 am - Milan Edoofa: This per annum fee includes your tuition fee, library fee, living expenses, food cost, and other basic amenities such as 24-hour wifi cost, water, and electricity bills. Are you clear on this?
16/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 258 0809: Yes clear
16/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 258 0809: Ok then
16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $750 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$300 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$300 before 28th November 2023.*
16/10/23, 2:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $600 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
16/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes we are
16/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Ok so we are paying 600 instead of $750
16/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 77 258 0809: So by 28 October that will be 10 working days  from today
16/10/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I would also want to  ask if there is an option to choose universities or its only 1 university that has accepted her
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss that moving ahead. For now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 77 258 0809: I stay in Kwekwe
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Diana!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, If you would be able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
17/10/23, 1:18 pm - +263 77 924 5194: Is it possible to get another agent near kwekwe town,Harare is too far from home
17/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes true m also looking at the time frame  I need to make arrangements at work so that I go to Harare to do the payments or else if possible if he has an account that I can deposit the money to him
17/10/23, 2:34 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Issue solved I have talked to MR Rajan and made  arrangements
17/10/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Otherwise,  I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Shorwi's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
17/10/23, 4:03 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Yes with pleasure that will be more convenient for me thank you
17/10/23, 4:47 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, if making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

18/10/23, 1:27 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Good afternoon

18/10/23, 1:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please, that is right.
18/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 258 0809: Thank you

18/10/23, 2:22 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, do you have any other queries that you would like to ask?
18/10/23, 3:50 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. In that case, let me share a few insights into the university with you -
