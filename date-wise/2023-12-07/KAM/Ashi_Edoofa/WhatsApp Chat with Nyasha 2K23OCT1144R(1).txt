17/10/23, 8:25 am - Ashi Edoofa: Absolutely understandable, @263772634673 , and I can appreciate that some schools restrict students from using their phones or other electronic gadgets to help them focus on their academics. Hebron High School strongly believes in this approach, and therefore, we are patiently waiting for her and are indeed looking forward to connecting with Nyasha once she is back home after her exams. Until then, we wish her all the best of luck.
17/10/23, 8:26 am - Ashi Edoofa: At the same time, I am also glad to see that you are able to connect with us on your daughter's behalf. This ensures that she stays on track in her academic journey.

Thank you once again
21/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are really welcome @263772634673. That is correct. Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
21/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
21/10/23, 12:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones. <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
21/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Thank you very much for further clarification.,its now clear and understandable

28/10/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 263 4673: My apologies for late submitting.
31/10/23, 7:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263772634673. Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
31/10/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Exactly its unacceptable
31/10/23, 7:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
31/10/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Yes i agree
31/10/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -
31/10/23, 7:52 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. Reappear in A Level *(Benefit Number 5)*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
31/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Understand
31/10/23, 7:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for her exams, and her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
31/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Very clear
31/10/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree  *(Benefit Number 6)*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
31/10/23, 7:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
31/10/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Clear
31/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point,
31/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career  *(Benefit Number 7)*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
31/10/23, 8:01 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
31/10/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 263 4673: So far so good,i understand now
31/10/23, 8:10 pm - Ashi Edoofa: As Nyasha's guardian, are you excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that Nyasha is among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
31/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Im very excited
31/10/23, 8:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation and with your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for the application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to her chosen course. 

Once we receive updates from the universities, we will quickly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
31/10/23, 8:13 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Throughout this process, please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or concerns. We are here to assist you and ensure that the higher education journey is meticulously planned and successful. 

Your peace of mind is of utmost importance to us, and we are fully dedicated to providing you with all the support you may require.
31/10/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Thank you for promising  me with the support needed for Nyasha s university journey
31/10/23, 8:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome sir, Have a good day ahead!
31/10/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Thank you very much for taking your resting time discussing future of my child.Be blessed
31/10/23, 8:25 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for your kind words @263772634673
14/11/23, 9:20 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Nyasha,

This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making education more affordable, isn’t it?
16/11/23, 12:44 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I really appreciate the good perentage offered ,thank very much
16/11/23, 12:48 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772634673. As you can see in the offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $350
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you will be able to see that Nyasha per annum cost of education is $1600.

At the same time, as you see in the offer letter, there are two components for the first year that are one-time payments, which are the Sports Fee and the Misc. Fee. This means the total expenses for the first year amount to $1600 (tuition) + $250 (fees) = $1850.

It is important to note that this cost is applicable for the first year only. From the second year onwards, Nyasha's annual cost of education will be $1600. I hope this clarifies things in a better way for you? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I understand ,i need clarification on the payment of admission an processing fee ..I need payment plan since we were not prepared to pay such amount once and iam requesting your good office for the effectiveness o the  Endowment Grand
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Indeed @263772634673, We will discuss about the payment plan soon, Please don't worry.
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Also, now that you're aware of Nyasha's per annum fee, let me share the list of facilities offered by the universities that are covered as per the university's fee structure:

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Examination Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour WiFi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Thank you
16/11/23, 1:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through my above message and when you are ready to continue with our discussion. I look forward to discussing how one can utilize the "Earn While You Learn" Program to make her education even more affordable and helping you understand the steps involved in securing this scholarship offer.
16/11/23, 1:21 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I have go through
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing to hear that. Now that we have established Nyasha's total annual education cost as $1600, let me also guide you on how we can make his education more affordable.

Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
16/11/23, 1:22 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn. 

The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. Is this clear to you?
16/11/23, 1:28 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Very clear
16/11/23, 1:29 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that with hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.

With these earned credits, one can use this $1000 to cover a portion of her annual fee, which is $1600. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $1600 - $1000 = $600, which will need to be paid by you as parents.
16/11/23, 1:30 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This illustrates how Nyasha can effectively make her education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
16/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Very advantageous in deed
16/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that Nyasha will dedicate herself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
16/11/23, 1:32 pm - Ashi Edoofa: With that said, let us now shift our focus to the registration fee of $1000 mentioned in her offer letter from MVN University. 

The registration fee we are discussing here is somewhat unique, especially for Edoofians. Unlike traditional international students, Edoofa students do not need to consider it as an additional cost to their annual education fees. 

Instead, it is considered a part of the first-year education cost. For you, the cost for your first year of education is $1500 and thus the registration fee of $1000 will be adjusted towards the same.
16/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Understandable
16/11/23, 1:40 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I am glad to see that your financial preparations are in place. I hope you recall that the per annum cost of education and the registration fee figures you mentioned were supposed to face a range of $2,000 to $3,000 for the annual cost of education and a registration fee between $500 and $750.
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, based on the discussions we had with your career counselor and their assessment of Nyasha's application, they encouraged us to secure a higher quantum of scholarship for her. This is the reason her per annum cost of education is only $1600, which is significantly less than the general cost of education fee range ($2000 to $3000).
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: When you look at this opportunity, with a higher quantum of scholarship, the registration fee may also appear a bit higher. But rest assured, this does not increase your financial burden, as it is an integral part of Nyasha's first year of education cost and will be utilized for the same purpose. I hope this makes sense?
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 263 4673: May i ask again about that $1600 ,is it payable once , quarterly or per semester.May you clarify on that?
16/11/23, 1:49 pm - Ashi Edoofa: @263772634673 We have payment plan for the annual fees, I'll share the same with you soon.
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In continuation of our discussion, I also want to emphasize that this scholarship opportunity for Nyasha is exclusive and highly beneficial. Besides this scholarship offer, it is unlikely that you will find a more affordable and high-quality education. 

Certainly, there are other universities that may assess your scholarship qualifications, and with those, the cost of education may fall within the specified range I mentioned earlier.
16/11/23, 1:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In light of this, I would like to pose a question to you: Would you prefer a scholarship offer that allows you to save at least $850 annually, even if it entails a higher registration fee? Or would you opt for a scholarship offer that forces you to pay a higher cost of education but with a lower registration fee, bearing in mind that the registration fee is part of the first-year expenses?
16/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Obvious i will go for the one wich i save $850 annually,evei if it entaiy a higher registration fee
16/11/23, 1:58 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Glad to see we share the same perspective. Now talking about the registration fee, as mentioned previously, the admission and processing fee of $1,000 specified in your offer letter will be adjusted against the first-year expenses of $1,600. Consequently, the amount you'll need to pay after you  arrive in India will be $1,600 - $1,000 = $600 and is to be paid within three days of your arrival to India. 

I hope you are clear about this as well?
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I understand
16/11/23, 2:02 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Moving forward with our discussion, as you can see in the offer letter, it's outlined that a student is required to submit a registration fee of $1000 within 15 days to secure their scholarship seat with the university. This sets the *deadline date as November 28th, 2023*.
16/11/23, 2:03 pm - Ashi Edoofa: However, in reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to Nyasha through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that he is entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Yes you can explain,thank you
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are welcome @263772634673. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent you will be responsible for the remaining $850 of the registration fee. This $850 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of $425 before the first deadline date of *November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of $425 before the second deadline date of *December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
16/11/23, 2:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Nyasha's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $850 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023*. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
16/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Thank you for the Endowment plan ,it reduces the burden and i opting for the instalment
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772634673. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
16/11/23, 2:16 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Hence. there are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
16/11/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Iam residing in Masvingo
16/11/23, 2:23 pm - Ashi Edoofa: No worries @263772634673, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through  Mr. Charles Jerera or your enrollment fee.

Let me share the details with you :- 
the same details are as below:-

SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA

ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828

16/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Better that way ,what about transfer charges are how much?
16/11/23, 2:50 pm - Ashi Edoofa: The transfer charges would be around 11%. . Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
16/11/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 263 4673: So far so good

20/11/23, 1:06 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Nyasha!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. In reference to our discussion previously, I'd like to inquire if you had the opportunity to have a discussion about the offer letter with Nyasha?
20/11/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Yes we managed to have the discussion including Nyasha .
20/11/23, 1:08 pm - Ashi Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 77 263 4673: We discussed about the offer letter as a family including Nyasha who is very excited about the opportunity to study abroad .I also explained to her the importance of EWYL program which is very important for her Schoolarship.Nyasha promised us that she will work hard to achieve her goals.We have a very successful discussion as a family
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Ashi Edoofa: I see and I am glad to see that your family is as excited as we are for you. I am sure she will ace her EWYL journey. If you have any questions or require assistance with any aspect of your offer letter or the university admission process, please don't hesitate to share them with me.

Moving forward, may I inquire if you had the opportunity to conduct further research about the university and learn more about it?
20/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 263 4673: My question is about food and medical aid does the University offer  again all these ?
20/11/23, 1:41 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Let me assist you @263772634673, food is not included in the services offered by the university and hence is not mentioned in the list. For the food, students have several options. They can choose to get food from outside, cook for themselves, opt for a meal plan, or use the university's food services. Rest assured, the student will receive guidance to choose the option that suits them best. I hope with this we are together?
20/11/23, 1:42 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Regarding the medical aid, Let me share that while the university provides various facilities, medical expenses are not covered under their purview. To protect international students from these expenses, students are supposed to get Medical Health Insurance.

A Medical Health Insurance policy is mandatory for all international students and it is up to the student if they wish to get it from India or their home country, it would cost them around $50 per annum subject to yearly revision.

If God forbids and something happens to you during your higher education, you would be protected from the financial risks or uncertainties that arise due to a medical emergency. I hope you are clear about this and that this addresses the query you had?
20/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Now i understand thank you very much
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: You are most welcome @263772634673, As you explore this opportunity further, I am sure that you are committed to completing the registration process and securing the scholarship seat. To help you get insights into how your life will be in India and the opportunities that you will have through Edoofa here, let me help you connect with one of our students - Valerie Rukobo.
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: She is a Zimbabwean Alumni who was among the first batch of Edoofians in 2017 who commenced their educational journey in India. She successfully completed her bachelor's in Computer Application, through the Edoofa program. 

Following her undergraduate studies, Valerie gained valuable work experience in India for a year before deciding to pursue her master's degree, also through the Edoofa Program. Her journey and experiences are a testament to the opportunities and support that the Edoofa Program offers.
20/11/23, 1:45 pm - Ashi Edoofa: If you wish, you can contact Valerie to learn more about her experiences and insights regarding the program. Additionally, you could request her to share her Offer Letter, showcasing the professional opportunities she secured through Edoofa.

Valerie's father, a retired Police Officer in Zimbabwe, can also provide valuable insights into his daughter's experiences and the impact of the Edoofa Program on her education and career development in India.

As the university has set a deadline of November 28, 2023, for completing the registration process, you have two options to choose from. You can either make an initial payment of $425 , or you can opt to pay the full $850 in one installment to expedite your admission process. Have you had an opportunity to consider which payment plan would be most suitable for you?
20/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 263 4673: I will go for the  instalment plan were i pay $425 this week and finish the balance before 30 days.
20/11/23, 2:04 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know of this. In addition to this, it would be great if you could kindly provide me with the specific date you have in mind for the payment and the mode of payment that you are planning to use so that I can share those as well with the university. Hence, could you share these with me?
20/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 263 4673: Most probably will deposit the first $425 on 22/11/2023 using Mr Charles Jerera 's FBC account
