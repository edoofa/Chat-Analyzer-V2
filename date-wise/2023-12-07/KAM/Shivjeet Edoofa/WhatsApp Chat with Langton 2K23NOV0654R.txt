21/11/23, 9:07 am - Milan Edoofa: Dear Esteemed Parents Langton!
Greetings to you all! ☀️

Today marks a bittersweet moment for me as I share news of my transition from the Admissions Team to a new role within the Department of Student Welfare at Edoofa. This change brings with it an incredible opportunity for me to continue contributing to the lives of our Edoofians, particularly those who have arrived in India, ensuring their academic journey and overall experience are enriched and fulfilling.

Over the past two years, it has been an absolute privilege to support numerous students, including yourselves, in their pursuit of higher education. Witnessing Edoofians thrive and excel in their dream universities and colleges has been immensely rewarding.
21/11/23, 9:08 am - Milan Edoofa: However, it is now time for me to embark on this new chapter, aspiring to make an even more profound impact on the lives of our students. Rest assured, the exceptional service and support that you have experienced will continue seamlessly as one of our accomplished admission officers, Mr. Shivjeet, will take over the helm of your admission journey from this point forward starting from Wednesday.

While I may not be directly involved in the immediate admission processes, I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to reconnect with you upon your arrival in India. Until then, I extend my heartfelt wishes for your continued success and a bright future filled with educational accomplishments.

With warm regards,
Milan Singh, Senior Admission Officer.
21/11/23, 9:28 am - +27 69 794 2759: Well congrats to you Sir

I am always happy to guide you through them. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
22/11/23, 11:54 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Langton!

I hope you are having a wonderful time. I would like to let you know that I will be available for this evening at 6:00 PM CAT. So please stay tuned and relax for now, and let us connect at the said time frame. Please enjoy your afternoon!

22/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
22/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted these steps are clear
22/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
22/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
22/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Step 3 and 4 noted as well
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
22/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
22/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Step 5 and 6 noted as well and well explained
22/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?

22/11/23, 7:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understandIf you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?ing with me individually.

23/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.

Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted I have read and understood the videos

25/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 118 4986: 2. To commence with, the difference between  a right and duties is that ,A right is a claim that one have against the state for example right to education ,right to medical facilities, right to equality before the law .A right is actually  recognised and it is protected by the state. For example the right to access to education is protected that is why we are attending schools collages and universities. That is why most of the rights are written in the constitution so that in the event that one is dined access to education can be able to stand up before any partial or competent court to claim for your rights .Furthermore  a duty is an expectation that one has to do for the society for example parents have the duty to act accordingly to provide emotional support to and shelter to their children  and most of this duties are protected  by the state. In addition rights are moral principles for certain standards which every person has by virtue  of being human being . These rights are protected by the state or international law for example right to security To add more civil rights are those rights obtained by people who are in a political party for example ministers ,members of Parliament.
25/11/23, 11:26 am - +263 77 118 4986: 3. To beggin with a prosecutor is a lawyer who decides whether to charge a person with crime and tries to prove that the person is guilty . In contrast an attorney will do the opposite they will work to provide enough evidence to defend their client who will be accused of criminal charges meaning they are authorised by the state to act on behalf of their client. To add more the prosecutor usually works in favour of the government whereas an Attorney arguesin favour of the client . A prosecutor works to prove reasonable doubt whereas the attorney attempt to create a reasonable doubt so that their client is declared innocent..A prosecutor only works on criminal cases while an attorney accepts both criminal and civil cases. Therefore one can be lowered to argue that this are some of main difference  between a prosecutor and an attorney.
25/11/23, 11:37 am - +263 77 118 4986: 4. To commence with, there are many branches in law such  as civil, coparete and criminal law .Civil law is mainly concerned with private relations of member of the society saving a primary source of law .Corporate law is the body of law governing relations,rights and conduct of persons company,organisations and businesses. Criminallaw is a system concerned with the punishment  of offenders and its main responsibility is to punish. Above all the types listed I found my self being certified by the criminal law. Mainly  this was driven by how the day to day running of the country and how criminals are being handled and its my sincere gratitude to pursue this career and live my dream and put effort in this field.This was also driven by my ability to critical thinking ,leadership skills, being  good at  problem silvingTis are some of the reasons which made me eager to pursue  this branchof law
25/11/23, 11:42 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning parents and my dear student!

I hope you're enjoying a pleasant weekend. Apologies for not being able to connect with you yesterday as I was tied up with some unforeseen work. I've set aside this weekend for our discussion and I am now available and eager to proceed with our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can continue.
25/11/23, 11:57 am - +263 77 118 4986: I'm doing good how are you
Yes we can continue
25/11/23, 12:07 pm - +263 77 118 4986: 5. Being a successful lawyer is a process which requires skills on an individual . The following  are some of the skills I personally  have and think that they could  be of great use during my way to be a successful lawyer . These include teamwork, creative problem solving ,good communication and being able to work under pressure. To commence with  the skill of communication will help me in terms of developing an awareness of different writing styles and expand aporn work thereby paving way to be a successful lawyer. The skill of being a creative at problem solving will help me to have the opportunity to create tailored solutions to problems thereby moving towards success. To add more the skill of teamwork will help because if people enjoy working with you they will recommend you to others thereby paving way to being a successful lawyer. This way you will have to get to know new people much better.
25/11/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 118 4986: I have send all the answers  for the questions 1 to 5
25/11/23, 12:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you were able fille out the online SOP form as well?
25/11/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 118 4986: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I have managed to fill the form
27/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as it was past my available hours. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 7:37 pm - +263 77 118 4986: I'm good I'm doing well hope you are also doing well
27/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I am ready we can proceed
27/11/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA LLB and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/11/23, 7:42 pm - +263 77 118 4986: The above information is correct
27/11/23, 7:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
27/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I'm ready  for the next step we can proceed
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes it is no possible
27/11/23, 8:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
27/11/23, 8:03 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted on this one
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
27/11/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
27/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes Mr Sahil explained this to me
27/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
28/11/23, 4:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parent and my dear student!

How are you doing this lovely afternoon?
28/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Afternoon I'm doing good how are you
28/11/23, 8:18 pm - +27 69 794 2759: We are good and you
29/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:23 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you so much I understand  hope you have a great  weekend  as well
04/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:38 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Evening how are you how was your  weekend
04/12/23, 6:40 pm - +263 71 375 6311: I am good and you all
04/12/23, 6:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great and my weekend was great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session? <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes we can proceed
04/12/23, 6:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $1200 to $1800 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
04/12/23, 7:04 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Yes I do understand
04/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
04/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $350 per annum
Accommodation Fee: $0 per annum (100% Sponsorship)
Miscellaneous Fee: $1000
Registration Fee: $1000 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $350 + Accommodation Fee $0 + Miscellaneous Fee $1000 = $1350 per annum
04/12/23, 7:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
04/12/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well noted
04/12/23, 8:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $1000, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $1000 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $1350 as per the above example.
04/12/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $1350 - $1000 = $350. This amount can be paid in two installments of $175 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
04/12/23, 8:16 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Well explained  and  noted as well
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
04/12/23, 8:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
04/12/23, 8:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
04/12/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 118 4986: I'm following  very well I think we can proceed
04/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

06/12/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
06/12/23, 9:36 pm - +263 77 118 4986: Thank you very much take care as well
