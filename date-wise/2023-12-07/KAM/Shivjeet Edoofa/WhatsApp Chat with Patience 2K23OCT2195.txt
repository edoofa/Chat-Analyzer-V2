31/10/23, 10:18 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm glad the instructions are clear to you, Patience. It's indeed important to reiterate that these forms play a crucial role in your admission journey. To facilitate a smooth process and maintain our timeline, it's necessary that all three forms - the Feedback Form, the Edoofa Student Application Form, and the EWYL Program Instructions and Pledge Document - should be completed and submitted by tomorrow at 12:30 PM. This deadline is vital in order to maintain the pace of your admission process and ensure that we progress seamlessly towards commencing your EWYL journey on time.

Understanding your schedule will aid us in scheduling our upcoming sessions and ensuring that you have ample time to complete the necessary procedures without any rush.
31/10/23, 10:25 pm - +263 78 820 3042: ..... I'm sorry I'll have to delay you can i submit the forms by Thursday around 2pm i have to get passport photos ,o don't hve any
31/10/23, 10:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's absolutely alright, Patience. Thank you for updating me on your circumstances. It's completely understandable that you need some time to organize the passport photos.

I completely acknowledge that getting passport photos might take a bit of time, so I understand the delay in filling out the forms. As much as possible, if you could manage to obtain the passport photos by tomorrow, preferably before 5:30 PM, that would be fantastic. This would enable us to stay within the set timeline and proceed smoothly with your admission process.
31/10/23, 10:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: However, if you find it challenging to get the photos by then, you're more than welcome to submit the forms without the photos by tomorrow. Once you've submitted the forms, please endeavor to arrange the passport photos and share them with us by Thursday around 2 PM. This way, we can ensure the timely completion of the forms while allowing some flexibility for obtaining the necessary photos. I hope you are comfortable with the same, right?
01/11/23, 6:24 am - +263 78 820 3042: Im okay with this, I'll make sure to provide the filled forms by today and the photos tomorrow

01/11/23, 7:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Amazing, thank you for sharing the forms with us, I have taken a note of these and will update them in our records as well.
01/11/23, 7:02 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Ready , we may start
01/11/23, 7:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright please, I would encourage you to go through the above image representing your university admission process and once you are done, let me know so that I can explain the same to you in detail.
01/11/23, 7:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Done
01/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/11/23, 7:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes, clear
01/11/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/11/23, 7:49 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes,

Is there a time where I get to see the programs offered by each university in case I prefer to change the program?
01/11/23, 8:05 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, it's important to note that the application process is typically processed for a specific course initially. Changing the course midway can be challenging, as it's essential to align your academic documents and SOP with the chosen program. It's always advisable to make the best choice from the start, but Edoofa is here to assist and support you throughout the process. I hope this is understood?
01/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes understood,thank you
01/11/23, 8:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL). <This message was edited>
01/11/23, 8:37 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes sir ,clear enough
01/11/23, 8:43 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
01/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 133 7570: How long do all these processes take to be completed?
01/11/23, 9:12 pm - Milan Edoofa: That's a great question. The duration of the entire university admission cycle can vary depending on several factors. On average, it may take approximately 15-20 days to complete all the necessary steps, from submitting your application to securing the admission seat. I hope this is understood?
01/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Well understood thank you
01/11/23, 10:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Moving ahead, do you have any other queries that you would like to ask regarding the same?
01/11/23, 10:30 pm - +263 77 133 7570: No more questions for now
01/11/23, 10:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/11/23, 10:39 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Yes we may proceed
01/11/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/11/23, 10:40 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
01/11/23, 10:42 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Ready
01/11/23, 10:44 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Ready

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform. Founders talk about their decade-long journey of discovering these schools and the experiences that students are having in these schools.

03/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 2.Explain about the BPM(Bussiness process management)life cycle.



The bussiness process life cycle is the discipline which people use various methods to discover,model, analyse,measure,improve, optimise an automate bussiness processes.A bussiness process is a set of steps taken to achieve business goals e.g marketing, production distribution and sales


The bussiness process management includes strategic alignment which is a proccess that ensures organization's structure and resources are linked with culture and environment.This helps workers connect their efforts to the organisation's overall goals hence increased efficiency and profitability.

It also looks at governance processes which are procedures used by representatives of an organisation's stakeholders that provide oversight of risks and control .  It looks at fairness, independency and  transparency. It helps a bussiness solve conflicts and define the proper functioning of institution and their acceptance by the public ( legitimacy)

BPM also looks at information technology where the business uses various software tools and solutions to align information technology and operations with business goals. The tools are used to measure productivity and to monitor performance

The business process also can be used to manage sales processes from lead generation in order to fulfill.It also looks at people since they development positive relations with the workplace if they feel they are part of the culture hence increased efficiency and consumer satisfaction.
03/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 3.How does business contribute to economic development. Explain and give examples.


Bussiness help the economy by providing locally produced goods and services which in turn leads to businesses competing and producing quality products for example the manufacturing of bread by Bakers Inn and Lobels in Zimbabwe has produced quality bread in the market.

Big and strong bussineses pay tax to the government that can be used for developing the country e.g development of schools, hospitals or can be used for services such as police.

The business provide employment that results in many people earning an income e.g net income an revenues , leading to better living standards .

Some businesses export their goods and services hence help correct balance of payment deficiety as volume of exports will now exceed volume of imports . Exportation also brings foreign currency which in turn can be used for developing the country e.g Zimbabwe has been using foreign currency to     support its medical field and educational sector .

By producing goods an services ,businesses are contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country which is the total outputs being produced by a country.
03/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 4. Explain with an example from your life which shows your managerial skills/talent


Being the oldest daughter in an African home explains  my whole life.

Growing up i needed to not only take care of myself but my family that is my old brother and young sister.

There are times out parents would leave the 3 of us home alone and all the responsibilities like what we will eat ,make sure the young one as well fed and looked after . This would be a time in my life i would realised i can manage 

Even in their presence my parents would delegate some of the responsibilities to me ,at times i wouldn't do it but seeing i had no one else to do chores or errands for me ,there was a time i accepted it an learnt to manage my school work,chores and other errands that might require my attention


In school,i was neither a prefect nor a class monitor but whenever i would talk to my classmates to maintain order and behave In class they would.Some teachers also assigned some work to me ,they would ask me to help them arrange their books in their offices.
03/11/23, 12:14 pm - +263 78 820 3042: 5. Explain the importance of the HR department to an organization.


The human resource (HR) is responsible for  making sure that the optimum number of workers is available and also looks at their health and safety,wages and salary . This ensures a smooth running of the organization .

The HR is also looks at job analysis that is it identifies job vacancies and specify on the requirements from the candidate to fill the vacant . They also describe the requirements for the job e.g duties . This allows an organisation to employ qualified people hence increased productivity.

The human resource also looks at performance appraisal where they evaluate individual performance against certain standards in the jobs . This keeps employees on their toes working hence increased profitability.

The HR also create systems and processes to measure and improve performance e.g payrolls an internal relations am providing development opportunity for the employees and this will lead to the workers being motivated.

The Human resource is also involved in recruitment which is when it invites a large pool of candidates to apply for the vacant Later it gets involved in sections where they engage in choosing the right candidates to fill the vacant,this is done through interviews and tests .

In the meantime, please take a look at the insights provided to you. Have a great night and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
22/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Why the EDOOFA SECURE PLAN?*

Edoofa Secure Plan is important for parents who have children joining the university for tertiary education in the next one to two years for several reasons:

*Financial Preparedness:* The Edoofa Secure plan helps parents prepare financially for the costs after the Scholarship being offered so that they are not caught off guard.

*Reduced Financial Stress:* Having the Edoofa Secure Plan in place can significantly reduce the financial stress on you as parents when your child is about to enter university. Knowing that there is a dedicated fund for education expenses provides peace of mind.

*Avoiding Debt*: Without proper savings, some parents may resort to taking out loans or accumulating credit card debt to cover their child's education costs. This Educational savings plan helps avoid the burden of debt and high-interest payments.

*Compound Interest:* By starting to save early and consistently contributing to the savings plan, parents can take advantage of compound interest, which can significantly increase the amount available for education expenses.

*Flexibility and Control:* The Edoofa Secure savings plans allow parents to have greater control over their finances and how they allocate funds for their child's education. They can choose investment options that align with their risk tolerance and financial goals.

*Encouraging Responsibility*: Involving your child in the process of saving for their education teaches them financial responsibility and the value of higher education. It also motivates them to outperform in Academics.

*Adapting to Unexpected Changes*: Life is full of surprises, and circumstances can change especially when there are political reforms changing each day impacting the Local Currency. Having an Edoofa Secure Plan allows parents to adapt to unexpected changes in their financial situation while still prioritizing their child's education.

*Peace of Mind:* Overall, having the Edoofa Secure plan provides parents with peace of mind, knowing that they are actively planning for their child's future and increasing the likelihood of providing them with a solid education.

In summary, an Edoofa Secure Plan is a critical financial tool for parents with their children entering university soon. It helps ensure that the financial aspect of tertiary education is well-managed, reduces stress, and allows parents to provide the best opportunities for their children without resorting to debt or financial hardship.
23/11/23, 6:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Patience !

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. With regard to my above message, I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Good day to you too , we can proceed
23/11/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now, could you please let me know if you were able to go through the above points that I shared with you the previous day?
23/11/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ,i went through them
23/11/23, 6:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Let me share with you how the Edoofa Secure Plan would work. I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Program Fee (Enrollment Fee) that you are asked to pay is $350, right?
23/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes
23/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Okay, so from the $350, you have already paid $200 and the balance $150 is due, right?
23/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 77 339 1635: Yes
23/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, based on our experience of over 14 years and after helping over 5000 students from different countries, what we have realized is financial planning is the most important factor when we think about higher education abroad. And to help the students and parents with that, the Edoofa Management has come up with a financially secure plan that will help you plan for your child’s higher education without stress and last-minute rush.
23/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Over the last 7 years, we have seen that 20-30% of students who take admission are unable to come to India because of lack of financial planning. The money required to book flights, and pay for accommodation and food after arrival is something that takes a toll and they are unable to send the child in that year and decide to defer the admission which creates a gap in education for the child. So, the Edoofa Secure Plan will reduce the financial pressure and smoothen the journey of sending your child to India.
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are in the month of November 2023 now and we have a good 20-21 months to plan for the finances. As you have been informed during the counseling session that we guarantee a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship on the tuition fees, the cost of education including the food, accommodation would be between $2000-$3000 and can even be less as well but not more, which means if you are able to save $150 per month for the next 20 months you will be able to save $3000 which is more than enough for the first year university fee which includes tuition fees (if any), food and accommodation.
23/11/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That means by the time your child will be in India, you would have already saved the $3000 that will cover the first year fee. Now, in these 20 months, I am sure the child will also be engaged in the EWYL program, and if the child secures to earn a minimum of $1000 in 20 months, that means the fees for 1.5 years is already secured. Now, for a 3 year course, if we follow the same approach for the remaining 1.5 year, the educational journey for the student and the financial journey for the parent is easy and smooth. Do you agree to this?
23/11/23, 8:36 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Yes, l agree it is indeed smooth but easy, l am not sure. All the same we are ready to put our maximum efforts as parents to save her education abroad.
23/11/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes, well understood
23/11/23, 9:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end, and it has been a long day for me, I will be closing our session for now. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 2:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Good afternoon
25/11/23, 1:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon parents and my dear student!

28/11/23, 10:11 am - +263 77 133 7570: Good morning
When is the EWYL supposed to be put in action?
29/11/23, 7:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 3:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Patience!

How are you doing this afternoon?
04/12/23, 3:37 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Im doing  okay and you?
04/12/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
04/12/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes i am ready
04/12/23, 4:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Now, I'd like to ask if you have any concerns you'd like to share regarding our past conversation.
04/12/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 820 3042: I want to know about the EWYLP,when am i  supposed to start ?
04/12/23, 4:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to some recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we will be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 12th of December. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 12th of December so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. You can use the current EWYL form you have filled out and make a small correction by overwriting it on the previously mentioned date and correcting it with the new one. May I know when you might be available for that?
04/12/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 820 3042: <Media omitted>
04/12/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the corrected form. Coming to the session. Great, also, there is another benefit, I am sure being in Zimbabwe you know how drastically the exchange rate fluctuates. If you are buying a dollar today, you might be spending 5000 bonds, but if you buy a dollar after a month, the rate would be different. Also, even if you choose to buy dollars every month and save at your home, it is not safe since there is news of robbery, and mugging every day. In that case, you will opt to save in the Bank, but again we know that savings in the Bank require a Nostro Account which means you have to pay the bank to keep your money safe, right?
04/12/23, 4:39 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes very correct <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 4:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: So, Edoofa Management has decided to help the parents and students prepare for the journey way ahead of time by helping them save money with Edoofa without any additional charges but rather saving additional money as well. Let me explain how:

Under the Edoofa Financial Secure Plan, a parent has to deposit a small amount of money which is $150 every month for the next 10 months. That means, in 10 months, the money saved will be $1500. When this money is saved, Edoofa will waive off the remaining $150 which was due from the Edoofa Program Fee of $350, thereby making a straight saving of $150 in 10 months. Imagine you paying $15 every month to the Bank of Zimbabwe to keep your money safe, and here Edoofa is paying you $15 every month to keep your money safe. Now, you must be wondering, why only for 10 months and not for 20 months, right?
04/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Yes ,why is that?
04/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The reason is on the completion of the 10 installments, the Edoofa Admissions team will start to work on the Child’s Admission Process by applying early to the universities so as to secure the scholarship and seat in the university. The earlier the seats are reserved, the higher the chances of securing a maximum quantum of scholarship, the higher the scholarship is the lesser the fee is and not only that, by securing the seat we are also entitled to pay the fees as per the old fee structure of the university and not the new structure which will be implemented in January 2025. To continue, when we apply to the university, you will be given the letter of intent where the fee, scholarship and registration fee will be mentioned.
04/12/23, 4:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As explained by the counselor during the enrollment, the registration fee is a part of the first-year university fee which is paid to reserve the seat in the university. It varies from $500-$1000 and is not an additional fee. Now, from the $1500 which is saved with Edoofa, the registration fee will be paid to the university to reserve the seat. For example, if the registration fee is $700, that means, Edoofa will pay $700 from the $1500 which you paid in 10 months. The updated balance with Edoofa will be $800 which will again be paid to the university when you come to India. This becomes a great relief to the parent as they don’t have to pay anything immediately after the student comes to India. The $800 saved will cover the remaining fees for the semester/year as it will be mentioned in the admission letter.
04/12/23, 4:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: What do you think about it?
04/12/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 339 1635: Is this how the EWYL works?
04/12/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Everything is clearly understood, but what is the scholarship percentage, l mean that one which the Edoofa  contributes to the fees? Or maybe l did not understand the "scholarship" aspect.
04/12/23, 4:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The scholarship percentage will range form 50% to 100% and you are an Edoofian we took charge of the rest here. May I know I'd you are clear here?
04/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 78 820 3042: The savings for the registration fee can start after receiving acceptance letter into the university is that so ?
04/12/23, 5:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It will be commenced before the arrival of the offer Letter as the letters are guaranteed by Edoofa.
04/12/23, 5:16 pm - +263 78 820 3042: Okay, so it can commence any time even next year ?
04/12/23, 5:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is absolutely correct and we will come to that.
04/12/23, 5:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, you must be wondering about the remaining 10 months, right?
04/12/23, 5:22 pm - +263 77 133 7570: 50% to100% of the University fees right, which will be stipulated in the Acceptance letter....so l think saving by parents should only commence once we know the expected fees.
04/12/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you here. Now, in the 11th month you will be guided to open a FBC Mastercard account with the deposit of $150. Why do you have to do this is because when you apply for the Visa, the Embassy asks for a Bank Statement and this is for that. We know it might be expensive if you deposit another $1500 in FBC, so, we have planned it accordingly. You will only be depositing for the 11th, 12th, 13th and 14th month, which is 4 months. Once the 4 months is completed, our Department of Student Welfare (DSW) team will assist you with your visa process, the bank statement will act as one of the required documents and you will receive the visa. Once the visa is received, you can deposit from the deposits of 4 months in FBC, you can withdraw the amount from FBC and book the flight ticket. This will help you to utilize the money as well. How does it sound?
04/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 133 7570: I still do not see why it is an advantage to be Edoofian because in everything you are explaining,l do not see where you are playing any part....
04/12/23, 5:31 pm - +263 77 339 1635: Am still not yet answered on how EWYL works...
04/12/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No, it is not and if you are referring to the EWYL credits it will be of use once you have arrived in India. May I know if you are clear here?
04/12/23, 6:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end. As I have another batch of students to attend to. Let's reconnect tomorrow again at 3:30 PM and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 77 133 7570: Have a great night too, but please try to clarify the concerns we are raising in the next session.
05/12/23, 3:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and My dear student!

During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
