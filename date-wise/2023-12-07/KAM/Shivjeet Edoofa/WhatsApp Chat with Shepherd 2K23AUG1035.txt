29/09/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I'm seeing that my parents are not available today and I think this is due to a network break down as it was raining today sir.

29/09/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While reviewing the EWYL form you shared, I observed a discrepancy regarding the orientation date. It's currently noted as November 11th instead of our agreed date, which is October 3rd. Rest assured, you can begin the EWYL session whenever you're prepared. However, for the orientation session that spans only a few days, I'm curious if your parents could actively participate in your absence. Could they be available to join this vital step for you?

29/09/23, 9:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, I appreciate your willingness to correct the date promptly. Considering the orientation date is October 3rd, let's update the form accordingly to reflect this date for the orientation session. This ensures everything is aligned and accurate.

Once you have the chance to update the form, kindly send it to me. We want to make sure all details are correct and up-to-date for a smooth start to your scholarship program.

06/10/23, 8:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/10/23, 8:49 pm - +263 78 975 0801: It's ok sir
06/10/23, 8:51 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes we can start
06/10/23, 8:53 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good evening Mr Shivjeet I'm glad to hear that you received the forms. Thank you so much sir. Yes we can proceed
06/10/23, 9:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 524 3459: I went through the image sir. You can explain
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/10/23, 9:19 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I understood them
06/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/10/23, 9:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/10/23, 9:27 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I'm following sir
06/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/10/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/10/23, 9:29 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I understood sir thank you for explaining all these
06/10/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to k now. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/10/23, 9:31 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes we can
06/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/10/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
06/10/23, 9:39 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir you can. I hope my network will not disturb

*When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. -Henry Ford*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session for the admission process. 

If you are ready. Shall we begin?
11/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I'm glad to connect with you this evening.
11/10/23, 6:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad too, May I know if you were abe to watch the videos?
11/10/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I went through the same
11/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
11/10/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 524 3459: The first thing that I understood from the videos is that Edoofa is a very good program that provides a quality education and it makes really helps the students to reach their dreams and success. I also understood that the education that is provided is affordable. 
I also understood that the program needs discipline and  students to follow instructions for them to achieve their goals and gain the scholarship. Another thing that I understood is that there are so many students that succeed through Edoofa and some others that are still studying are being pleased with the Edoofa program and education provided and also the quality of life for example with peace lovely people and friendships. I also understood that Edoofa has lovely people. Another thing I understood is that the Edoofa program helps students in the choice of quality universities with quality education.
11/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
11/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
11/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
11/10/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
11/10/23, 6:50 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes we are on the same page sir
11/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
11/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
11/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

11/10/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
11/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
11/10/23, 7:39 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I understand but the only problem I have is that because of the lack of requirements at my school I might be able to edit and create PDF af the documents so I am asking you to write my responses and share them with you.
11/10/23, 7:40 pm - +263 78 524 3459: As for the o level results I'm going to collect the certificate from my school head's office and share them with you
11/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Another challenge of filling this online is the network connection at my school as you know sir sometimes the network may be down and l am asking if I can have an offline form sir
11/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The responses for the academic questions are to be written by the student. You can share the answers here in any format that you wish to send.
11/10/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is well noted
11/10/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Allow me to clarify why it's necessary to submit the details exclusively through the provided online link. The reason is that once you have successfully completed the document, the details will be automatically entered into my files and it will be convenient for us to share them with the university officials. I hope you are clear about this?
11/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 524 3459: I'm clear about that sir and I'm going to do that tomorrow as soon as our school network is opened
11/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so much sir
11/10/23, 8:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that.
11/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you sir

19/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Number 1. Deferences between rights and explaining the differences between the civil Rights and human rights.

Rights are defined as claims of an individual that are assential for the development of his or her own self and that are recognized by society or the state whilst a duty is something that someone is expected or required to do. Rights can be also defined as legal, social or ethical principals of freedom that people are entitled for by a governing body.

The differences between human rights and civil rights are that human rights are rights one acquires by being alive while civil rights are rights that one obtains by being a legal member of a certain political state. Human rights are a set of principles that outline the fundamental entitlements that everyone has simply by virtue of being human. These rights are described as inalienable, which means that no government, institution, or individual can take them away or limit them. Examples of human rights are right to liberty, life and security of person; freedom from slavery, torture, and arbitrary arrest, the right to a fair trial and due to process of law and also right to religion. Civil rights are legal rights that protect people from discrimination based on certain characteristics, such as race,gender, religion, sexuality, national origin, disability and age.

In a nutshell, the rights are different from duties as stated in the above paragraphs. It is also important to note that civil rights and human rights are different as shown in the above passage.

Differences between a prosecutor and an attorney.

The differences between a prosecutor and an attorney starts on the point that a prosecutor typically works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, while an attorney represents the person accused of a crime an attempts to mantain the client's innocence.
 
This clearly shows the difference between the two which are the prosecutor and an attorney  as an attorney represents the person who is being accused of a crime. An attorney attempts to mantain the client's innocence. 

 Another difference is that a prosecutor only works on criminal cases while a defense attorney can accept both criminal and civil cases.

Furthermore, a prosecutor is being employed by the government and prosecutes people accused of breaking the law.

In conclusion, the differences between a prosecutor and an attorney are shown in the above paragraphs as a prosecutor works for the government agency bringing criminal charges and must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt while an attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to mantain the client's innocence.

19/10/23, 4:36 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good evening Mr Shivjeet. I am glad to connect with you today. I have finished the number 1, 2,3, and 5 and I am going to send the response of the question number 4 as soon as possible sir. Thank you.

I am fully prepared to embark on your session, and I'd like to emphasize that I'll also be at your service in the evening at 7:30 PM. If you're ready to begin now, let's dive into the session and make the most of it. <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 8:33 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Number 4.

There are three branches of law that are corporate,civil and criminal law. Among these braches I am most interested in civil law. There are a few reasons that makes me interested in persueing civil law. 

The first reason is that I am most interested in resolving conflicts among people, promoting equality and unity. This is the first reason that makes me interested in persueing civil law. Essentially the civil law is about conflict resolution, ensuring disputes between individuals do not escalate into a violent confrontation. It encourages cooperation between members of society, deterring exploitative behaviors and unethical business practices. This makes me interested in persueing civil law.

Furthermore, the branch of civil law provides a beneficial career that can make someone to success and reach his/her dreams for it  employs to a greater extend. With this I want to persue civil law.

To conclude, these are the reasons that makes me interested in persueing civil law as illustrated above.
26/10/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you have successfully filled out the online SOP form and answered the questions perfectly. Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry A-Level (If you do not have the A level Results).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
28/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 524 3459: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 524 3459: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 78 524 3459: I am going to share the ordinary level results with you as soon as my school headmaster handle them to me sir I talked to him and he said he is going to search for them and give them to me
30/10/23, 6:35 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I agree sir
30/10/23, 6:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
30/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
30/10/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
30/10/23, 6:39 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir my counselor has discussed the registration fee during the counseling session
30/10/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
30/10/23, 6:40 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I understand and we are on the same page
30/10/23, 6:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
30/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
30/10/23, 6:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
30/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I understood sir
30/10/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
30/10/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India.
30/10/23, 7:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
30/10/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I understand
30/10/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
30/10/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
30/10/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
30/10/23, 7:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
30/10/23, 7:37 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok as for this sir I can say the challenge will only be there on the amounts as my parent is not employed but use to survive with peace jobs and as from the first time they promised to pay that and to work hard to get the money and as this country is not yet developed there may be some challenges of delays in employments and pays so that's the only challenges that may affect but our hearts are willing to fulfill every step and everything sir
30/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I appreciate your commitment and understanding, and it's great to hear that you and your parents are willing to overcome any challenges that may arise during this process. Edoofa's scholarship program is designed to help students like you access quality education in India, and the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) component offers a unique opportunity to work and earn scholarship credits.
30/10/23, 9:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Unfortunately, I was not able to connect with you earlier as I was occupied with a meeting. Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 2:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
31/10/23, 2:03 am - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so much sir
03/11/23, 5:29 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mr Shivjeet. I'm glad to let you know that I am available now. I was not available because of yesterday's exam.
04/11/23, 9:37 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome.
04/11/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 524 3459: Thank you so much sir for your update
06/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet. I am glad to connect with you today
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
06/11/23, 3:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
06/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
06/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok I understand sir thank you so much
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible.

Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
06/11/23, 3:18 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I am ready to see this
06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
06/11/23, 3:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
06/11/23, 3:32 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I am through with the same but I need to understand better about the benefits of 2024 students and the switching to a diploma
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan and you wil have a better understanding -
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
06/11/23, 3:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
06/11/23, 3:45 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I understand
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
06/11/23, 3:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I understand and I appreciate that
06/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
06/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
06/11/23, 4:15 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I understand
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
06/11/23, 4:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
06/11/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I am clear with that
06/11/23, 6:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
06/11/23, 6:43 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes I would like to be familiar with the assessment sir
06/11/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
06/11/23, 6:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
06/11/23, 6:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
06/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir now I understand and at this stage I am just left with one question
06/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 78 524 3459: So it means the scholarship percentage is determined by the results or performance of the student?
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
06/11/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I am now answered thank you
06/11/23, 6:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir I agree
06/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I understand that
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I am clear with the same thank you
06/11/23, 7:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 7:09 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Ok sir thank you so much for explaining all these . I am clear  with that
06/11/23, 7:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 524 3459: I am very glad to hear about the benefits sir . About the costs I am also clear about that and  if no challenges disturb for example the payment of the costs everything will be fine as I am willing to be a proud edoofian and I hope everything will be fine and I hope my parents will try all their best to find the money
06/11/23, 7:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
06/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I am
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
06/11/23, 7:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.

18/11/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
18/11/23, 11:02 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
18/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 78 975 0801: Ok sir I am glad to hear this
18/11/23, 11:05 am - +263 78 975 0801: Yes sir I'm looking forward. My English is not good but I hope we'll understand each other. Thank you
18/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know it is alright and your english is understandable to me. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
18/11/23, 11:07 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
18/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 78 975 0801: Thank you sir I am ready
18/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 78 975 0801: 1. $900
2. The standard duration of the course is 5yrs
Admission and procedure fee is$300
4. Registration fee is$750
18/11/23, 11:32 am - +263 78 975 0801: 1. Our semester fee after the scholarship is 900 USD
2. The standard duration of the course is 5 years (10 semesters)
3. The admission and procedure fee is 300 USD
4. The registration fee is 750 USD
18/11/23, 12:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
18/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes thank you so much for your clarification
18/11/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome and I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
18/11/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
18/11/23, 12:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
18/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was hoping for a response from your end to complete our session for the day. It seems that you were not able to continue with the conversation.

However, As much as I would like proceed further with the session my available hours are ending soon a little early as it is the weekend here. So, let us connect on Monday from 12:30 PM onwards. Have a great weekend with tons of Fun, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
18/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Ok sir thank you so much for making me understand on this.
18/11/23, 1:35 pm - +263 78 975 0801: I am sorry for late response there is network challenges
18/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 975 0801: I think we can afford this one as a family
18/11/23, 1:39 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Thank you sir enjoy your weekend.
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet I am glad to let you know that I will be available from 1900 today thank you
20/11/23, 2:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges at the moment?
20/11/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 524 3459: It's just network sir at my place. Sometimes it works properly from the evening through out the night and sometimes Everytime
20/11/23, 7:15 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Good evening Mr Shivjeet
20/11/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening. I understand the challenges. May I know if you are now ready to proceed with the session?
20/11/23, 7:38 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes sir I am ready I am using my mom's account today
20/11/23, 7:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that now continuing with the conversation. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements.

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation.s

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
20/11/23, 7:50 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Ok sir I understand that. And I also appreciate it
20/11/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear  that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
20/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes I'm clear with that sir
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
20/11/23, 8:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on December 01st, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
20/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes sir
20/11/23, 8:19 pm - +263 78 975 0801: I am not clear on this one
20/11/23, 8:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Sure thing! Basically, the 300 admissions and processing fee mentioned in the letter won't apply to you because of two things: the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. So, you won't have to pay that $300 as part of your education costs. It's good news!
20/11/23, 8:25 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Ok sir I now understand
20/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
20/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes sir I would like you to explain
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of December 01st, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of January 01st, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
20/11/23, 8:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before December 01st, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
20/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Yes sir I understand and I really appreciate this.
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
20/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
20/11/23, 8:35 pm - +263 78 975 0801: I live in the city of Masvingo sir
20/11/23, 8:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
20/11/23, 8:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
20/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Ok thank you so much sir and starting from now we are starting to plan to find the money and pay
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
20/11/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Charles FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
20/11/23, 8:48 pm - +263 78 975 0801: No sir the details of Mr jerera are still available on our documents
20/11/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, then.  now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
20/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Okay sir I understand
20/11/23, 8:56 pm - +263 78 975 0801: Thank you for explaining
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
20/11/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
20/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I have understood
20/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
20/11/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
20/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
20/11/23, 9:23 pm - +263 78 524 3459: Yes sir I also understood this one
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
20/11/23, 9:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
21/11/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 524 3459: Good morning Mr Shivjeet. I am glad to connect with you this morning and I hope you are doing well. I have some important issue I would like to discuss with you and some questions I would like to ask.
21/11/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the delay, I was occupied with a meeting with the team. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day and conclude our session in due time to avoid any delay in your session so that you have free time to yourself.

30/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I wanted to reach out to you to get an update on the admission formalities for your university admission. According to our records, you are supposed to make a payment of your registration fee by Tomorrow, 1st December 2023. 

As a part of the application process, it is important for us to share an update with the university officials and guide them on the steps that they have to take to ensure your application is on track. Failure to do so may result in the loss of your scholarship offer.

Therefore, I wanted to reach out to you once again and ensure that we are still connected and inquire if you have been able to make the preparation of the payment of your fee?
