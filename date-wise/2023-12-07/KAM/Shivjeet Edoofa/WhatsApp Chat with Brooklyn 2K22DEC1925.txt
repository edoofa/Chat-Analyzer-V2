Allow me to provide you with a little knowledge about it as well. Gandhi Jayanti is an annual national holiday in India celebrated on October 2nd to commemorate the birthday of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi. He was a prominent leader in the Indian independence movement against British rule and a proponent of nonviolent civil disobedience as a means of achieving political and social change.

18/10/23, 8:18 pm - +27 71 005 5751: This is accurate information .

19/10/23, 8:07 pm - +27 71 005 5751: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. With that shall we proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 8:17 pm - +27 71 005 5751: We can proceed.
19/10/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 8:27 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted.
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
19/10/23, 9:15 pm - +27 71 005 5751: I have gone through and we can discuss them in detail.
19/10/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 9:22 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted.
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 9:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 9:31 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Indeed it resonates with me.
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 9:44 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,it does.
19/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 9:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for October 29, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before October 29, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by November 29, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 10:00 pm - +27 71 005 5751: I have followed all the details and everything is crystal clear.
19/10/23, 10:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 10:16 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Providing me with more information will be ideal.
19/10/23, 10:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today with the session. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon. So, let us connect tomorrow from 12:00 PM onwards. Have a great night, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
19/10/23, 10:22 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Welcome,happy for such an insightful  session,hoping to connect again tomorrow.Have a blessed night.
20/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Brooklyn. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

Please excuse me for the delay in response, dear. I was occupied with a meeting. I would like to let you know that I will be occupied for the next 3 hours. So, I shall schedule our session for this evening at 7:30 PM. Please do enjoy your afternoon.
20/10/23, 7:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and Brooklyn.

I am excited to say that I am now available and active to guide you through the admission process. So, how are you spending this lovely evening?

@27710055751
20/10/23, 8:53 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Hie and good evening.Pleased to be once again having the opportunity to connect and proceed with our session.Just chilling at home before retiring to bed,happy to find you in good spirits.
20/10/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Im delighted to be connecting with you again. It's wonderful to hear that you're in a relaxed mood at home. I'm also doing well, and I'm here to assist you with any questions or concerns you may have regarding the admission process or any other topics you'd like to discuss.

Let's continue our session. Shall we? <This message was edited>
20/10/23, 8:58 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,we can continue.
20/10/23, 9:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
20/10/23, 9:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Very,very clear.
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
20/10/23, 9:18 pm - +27 71 005 5751: I agree with 1 and 2,it is a benefit but 3,even though there is a bit of some money back,it is not a benefit,that is my opinion.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one so that you have a better understanding -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
20/10/23, 9:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted and clear.
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
20/10/23, 10:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
20/10/23, 10:03 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Absolutely clear.
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
20/10/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?

15/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you have the letter in your possession, I wanted to take this opportunity to reach out and inquire if you've had the chance to go through the offer letter thoroughly? 

It's crucial for us to discuss the details enclosed in the letter, and hence, as promised, I am here at the scheduled time to assist you in gaining a deep understanding of your scholarship and your admission to the university.
15/11/23, 12:33 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Good afternoon,l'm Brooklyn's father,standing in for him as he is currently busy with his final examinations.I managed to thoroughly go through the offer letter and we can discuss the details.

Before we proceed, I want to acknowledge Brooklyn's dedication to his final examinations, and please pass on my best wishes to him.  As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted with thanks.
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing. Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 12:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 12:45 pm - +27 71 005 5751: 1.Tuition fee after the scholarship is $900 USD
2.The Standard Duration of the course is 4Years(8 Semesters)
3.Admission and Procedure Fee(One time  Payable) is $300 USD
4.Registration Fee is $750 USD
15/11/23, 12:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a four-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 8 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 12:54 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,precisely.
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 12:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses.
15/11/23, 12:59 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted.
15/11/23, 12:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 1:01 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted.
15/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 1:10 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,l am very clear with that.
15/11/23, 1:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 1:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 1:22 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,we are absolutely together so far.
15/11/23, 1:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 1:25 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,you may kindly explain how this works.
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 1:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 1:40 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,the option is clear and we are 100% in agreement with regards to the above mentioned details.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am very happy to hear that. Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 1:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 1:49 pm - +27 71 005 5751: I'm staying in Norton,a few kilometers from Harare.At one time last year,l made a payment to you through a foreign currency bank account and l hope it is the same process.
15/11/23, 1:53 pm - +27 71 005 5751: If there are other alternative modes available,you may as well share with me.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 1:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 2:01 pm - +27 71 005 5751: This will really be a fantastic mode,will get in touch with him and organize for the payment,l greatly appreciate.
15/11/23, 2:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 2:07 pm - +27 71 005 5751: It is very convenient and also aligns with my preferences,l'm happy with this setup.
15/11/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Needmore Maphosa for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 2:44 pm - +27 71 005 5751: For reference sake,you may send the details but  l'm happy and will use Mr Rajan's option.
15/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, If that is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Name: Maposa Needmore
Account Number: 5290638027654065
Contact Number: +263 71 918 3664
15/11/23, 2:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you were able to receive the details.
15/11/23, 2:54 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Thank you very much,l have the details with me.
15/11/23, 4:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You are most welcome. Now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 4:22 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Noted.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 4:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 4:26 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,l have clearly understood this.
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 4:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - +27 71 005 5751: Yes,it is crystal clear.
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 4:38 pm - +27 71 005 5751: No queries at this juncture,all has been clear in my view,if anything crops up,l will not hesitate to enquire.
15/11/23, 5:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -

15/11/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
