12/10/23, 7:56 am - +263 78 125 6089: I'm available from 3pm to 5pm
12/10/23, 2:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

*“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” – Nelson Mandela*

With that positive note, I am here to continue with your session. 

If you are available for the session shall we begin?
12/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 78 125 6089: I am now
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
12/10/23, 5:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
12/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Clear
12/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
12/10/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
12/10/23, 5:37 pm - +263 78 125 6089: I'm following
12/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
12/10/23, 5:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
12/10/23, 6:07 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Any other requirements for VISA application
12/10/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: You will be requiring your passport for the visa application. For the application for your VISA, you will be guided by us, so please do not worry about that right now.
12/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Oky thank you
12/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
12/10/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes please
12/10/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
12/10/23, 6:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
12/10/23, 6:58 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Im ready
12/10/23, 7:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

12/10/23, 7:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
12/10/23, 9:18 pm - +263 78 125 6089: By tomorrow at 1pm
12/10/23, 9:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for confirming. Going through the videos by tomorrow at 1 p.m. works well. After you've had the chance to review and summarize your understanding, we can plan our next session to discuss any questions or insights you may have gained.

So shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 7:30 PM?
13/10/23, 9:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening,

I hope you are doing well and are as excited as we are approaching the upcoming weeks. Please do excuse me for the late reply. I was occupied with a meeting with the admission team. I am happy to say that I am now available to take your session. If you are currently available for the session, please do let me know so that we can further proceed with the session.
14/10/23, 7:52 am - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Morning, dear parents and Anesu

I trust this message finds you in good health. Unfortunately, I experienced a lack of response from your end during our recent attempts at communication. Nevertheless, I remain committed to our discussion and sincerely wish to proceed.

However, I am eager to catch up and continue our discussion. I am happy to let you know that I am available today a little bit early as it is the weekend and very much ready to take on our session with full productivity. Please let me know so that we can continue our session and wrap it up early.
14/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Two important qualities of successful Edoofians are people who are open minded and ready to go an extra mile. For one to be successful, you must ask the experts so that they may point you in the right direction
14/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 125 6089: The Co Founders of edoofa have invested their time to dig deep into identifying the best universities so as to make sure that Edoofians are happy during their time in India.
14/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 125 6089: The Statement of Purpose is a document which gives a student a unique opportunity to convince the admission officers and any school to accept you. It must have you abilities, strengths, past academic achievements and your vision and also why you have choosen that school
14/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Sorry for late responses l was facing some difficulties here
16/10/23, 7:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening. I hope you are well and blessed. I was unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out. I understand your challenges it is alright. 

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
17/10/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Hello
17/10/23, 5:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Hello, 

How are you dong today, dear?
17/10/23, 5:49 pm - +263 78 125 6089: I'm good thanks and how are you
17/10/23, 5:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am good too, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
17/10/23, 5:53 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes l am
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
17/10/23, 6:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
17/10/23, 6:25 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes l am following
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 5:00 PM.
17/10/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

17/10/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As there has been a delay regarding our session for your admission process due to the recent inactivity, and it's alright. Due to this reason, we would be moving a little backward a few days for your EWYL session with your mentor, which is on the 20th of October. So, I would like you to kindly correct the form in your orientation session availability date as the 20th of October so that we will be able to schedule a session for your mentor and share the same with them. May I know by when you might be available for that?
17/10/23, 8:03 pm - +263 78 125 6089: By tomorrow
17/10/23, 8:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. I shall wait for the same.
17/10/23, 8:12 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Oky
18/10/23, 4:33 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Im ready
18/10/23, 4:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you were able to complete the above tasks?

I hope you are doing well and blessed. I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
19/10/23, 5:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been unnoticed. With that in mind, I am happy to let you know that I am now available to take our session. I would like to know if you are currently active and ready to proceed with the session?
20/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 125 6089: 2)Please elaborate about the first law of thermodynamics

 The first law of thermodynamics is often called the law of conservation of energy. It states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be changed from one form to another. For example, when you burn fuel in a car engine, the chemical energy in the fuel is converted into heat and kinetic energy as the car moves. The total amount of energy doesn't change, it's just been transferred from one form to another. The second law of thermodynamics deals with the concept of entropy, which is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. The second law says that the entropy of an isolated system always increases. In other words, as time goes on, things become more and more disordered and random.The second law also has some other important implications. One of these is the concept of reversibility. The second law states that some processes are irreversible, meaning they cannot be reversed and returned to their original state. For example, when you burn a piece of paper, it's impossible to turn the ashes back into paper again. The process of burning is irreversible. The second law also explains why perpetual motion machines are impossible. A perpetual motion machine is a machine that would keep going forever without any input of energy. The second law says this is impossible because of the law of entropy.

3)what is a valve? what are the types of valves? 
 what is the function of a butterfly valve?
A valve is a device that controls the flow of a fluid or gas. There are many different types of valves, including ball valves, check valves, diaphragm valves, and butterfly valves. Butterfly valves are one of the most common types of valves. They have a rotating disc inside the valve body that controls the flow of fluid or gas. The disc has a stem attached to it, and when the stem is turned, the disc rotates and opens or closes the valve. Butterfly valves are used in a variety of applications, including water treatment, oil and gas pipelines, and HVAC systems. they are usually very quick to open and close, making them ideal for applications that require fast flow control. Second, butterfly valves are very compact, taking up less space than other types of valves. Third, butterfly valves are relatively inexpensive to manufacture and maintain. Finally, butterfly valves are highly reliable and can withstand high pressures and temperatures.

4)What is heat treatment and why is it done
Heat treatment is a process used to change the properties of metals and other materials by heating and cooling them. The goal of heat treatment is to improve the material's strength, hardness, toughness, ductility, and other properties. There are many different types of heat treatments, including annealing, tempering, and case hardening. Heat treatment is often used to make metals more resistant to wear, corrosion, and other forms of damage. In some cases, heat treatment can also be used to improve the appearance of metals. Annealing is a process of heating a material to a specific temperature and then slowly cooling it to relieve internal stresses and make it more workable. Tempering is a process of heating a material to a specific temperature below its critical point and then cooling it to produce a desired hardness and toughness. hardening, is a process of heating a metal to a specific temperature, quenching it in oil or water, and then tempering it to create a hard outer layer and a soft inner layer.

5)What are compressors and what are different types and what types of compressors used in gas turbines and why? 

Compressors are devices that increase the pressure of a gas by reducing its volume. There are several different types of compressors, including centrifugal, reciprocating, rotary screw, and scroll compressors. Centrifugal compressors use a rotating impeller to increase the velocity and pressure of a gas. Reciprocating compressors use pistons and cylinders to compress a gas. Rotary screw compressors use two meshing helical screws to compress a gas. And scroll compressors use a spiral-shaped scroll to compress a gas.The most common types of compressors used in gas turbines are axial compressors and centrifugal compressors. Axial compressors use a series of blades to compress air and direct it into the combustion chamber. Centrifugal compressors use a rotating impeller to compress air and direct it into the combustion chamber. Gas turbines use compressors because they need a large volume of air at high pressure to produce power. The compressed air is mixed with fuel and ignited in the combustion chamber, creating hot gas that expands through the turbine. This expansion turns the turbine and generates power.

26/10/23, 7:53 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes it is
26/10/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
26/10/23, 7:58 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
26/10/23, 8:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
30/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Will start at 6:00pm if you are available
30/10/23, 2:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly we can work on that as well.
30/10/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are available to proceed with the session now, dear?
31/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
31/10/23, 6:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/10/23, 6:44 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes they look happy
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
31/10/23, 6:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs. So, May I know if you are ready for this?
31/10/23, 7:05 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes l am ready
31/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that here you go!

*Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
31/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
31/10/23, 7:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
31/10/23, 7:25 pm - +263 78 125 6089: l have reviewed the benefits
31/10/23, 7:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
31/10/23, 7:54 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Understood
31/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
31/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
31/10/23, 7:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
31/10/23, 8:10 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Yes
31/10/23, 8:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your time today. I will be closing our session for now as I have an upcoming meeting to attend. I would like to also inform you that I will not be available tomorrow to proceed with the session as I will be on leave for my birthday. So, let's reschedule the session for the next day, which is Thursday, starting from 2:00 PM onwards. I will also be available in the evening at 5:00 PM as well.
31/10/23, 8:27 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Oky thank you and happy birthday in advance
31/10/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you, dear.
31/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 78 125 6089: You're welcome
02/11/23, 1:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Anesu.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed.

I'm now active and ready to take on your session. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Afternoon Anesu is writing an examination now he will spend 2hrs 30 minutes so not available
02/11/23, 2:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that the parents also proceed with the session for the admission process.
02/11/23, 2:44 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Its fine we can proceed
02/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 2:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 2:58 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Understood
02/11/23, 2:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 73 319 1048: I don't understand here because l paid 388 in total
02/11/23, 3:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The University Registration Fee, ranging from $500 to $750, is a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
02/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 73 319 1048: OK its fine
02/11/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 5:34 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Yes more information about this
02/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 5:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
02/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 73 319 1048: okay l understand
02/11/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
06/11/23, 2:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues.

With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
06/11/23, 5:54 pm - +263 78 125 6089: How are you
06/11/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, than you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
06/11/23, 6:51 pm - +263 73 319 1048: We can proceed
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
06/11/23, 6:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Its clear
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 7:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 7:04 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Yes
06/11/23, 7:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 7:16 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Okay
06/11/23, 7:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 7:40 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Yes l have a query on the enrollment fee which you said is for securing a place ,will it be part of the tution for the first year of the student
06/11/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It is the registration fee and it is a component of your total university tuition fees. This fee is necessary to secure your seat at the university and is required to be paid before the start of your session while you are at your home, by the student/parent/guardian. It's important to understand that this amount is not an additional charge, it will be subtracted from your first year's tuition fees. I hope we are on the same page here?
06/11/23, 7:49 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Yes understood
06/11/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?
06/11/23, 7:52 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Yes let's move forward
06/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for your confirmation. With your approval, we will now proceed with the preparations for your application and submit it to the universities recommended by the academic board, tailored to his chosen course. Once we receive updates from the universities, we will promptly reconnect with you and share all the relevant information.
06/11/23, 7:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On that note, we will conclude our discussion for today.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate your application after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
06/11/23, 7:55 pm - +263 73 319 1048: Noted thank you
25/11/23, 8:04 pm - +263 78 125 6089: Hello

I hope you are having a fine evening today. I would like to let you know that the universities are evaluating your offer letter and they will be sharing you with the letter very soon. I understand that this has been taking longer than expected.
