For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
06/10/23, 9:50 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes
06/10/23, 9:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Am done
06/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
06/10/23, 9:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
06/10/23, 9:58 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes they are clear
06/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
06/10/23, 9:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
06/10/23, 10:03 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes yes we are together
06/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
06/10/23, 10:07 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
06/10/23, 10:09 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes everything is clear
06/10/23, 10:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to k now. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shallwe start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
06/10/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes
06/10/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
06/10/23, 10:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
06/10/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Go ahead
06/10/23, 10:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>

06/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection. 

Please go through the 4 videos, our next session will be scheduled after you have gone through all of them and have been able to summarize your understanding. Hence I would like to know by when do you think you will be able to go through these videos so that we can schedule our next session accordingly?
06/10/23, 10:14 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Unfortunately I don't have internet connection right now so can I open them tomorrow morning when am connected??
06/10/23, 10:16 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Am using data at the moment so If I open I might deplete it
06/10/23, 10:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, dear. In that case shall we connect tomorrow at 12:00 PM ?
06/10/23, 10:21 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Okay
07/10/23, 12:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon dear parents and Brandon. I hope this message finds you well and blessed. 

May I know if you were able to go through the above videos?
07/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes went through the videos
07/10/23, 1:30 pm - +263 77 673 7538: I was told you would give me a form to fill in
07/10/23, 1:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that, dear. So can you share your understanding of the 4 videos in detail with me?
07/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Basically the four videos convey the purpose of Edoofa and the expectations from being an Edoofian so basically Edoofa will assist one in making the right choice in tertiary education as they have been in the game for over 10 years now
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. Let me help you by elaborating more. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow. <This message was edited>
07/10/23, 1:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
07/10/23, 1:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
07/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes we are on the same page
07/10/23, 1:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
07/10/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Monday 5:00 PM.
07/10/23, 1:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

18/10/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 673 7538: <Media omitted>
18/10/23, 6:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, Brandon.
Please excuse me for the late reply. I was discussing a decision with the admission team and would like to share a few insights. May I know if you are available?
18/10/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes I am available
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I wanted to provide you with an important update regarding your enrollment timeline for the upcoming term in January 2024.

Following our recent conversation, your counselor informed me that you inquired about the possibility of taking a term off and rejoining classes in January 2024. I'm glad to inform you that such an option is available to students.
18/10/23, 8:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, in order to align with this timeline, it's crucial to complete the admission formalities accordingly. It seems that you completed the enrollment process based on the August 2024 timeline, unintentionally overlooking the January 2024 option.
18/10/23, 8:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to take a term off and join the January 2024 intake, students needed to complete their admission formalities towards the end of September. Unfortunately, by that time, you had already completed your enrollment formalities for Edoofa, which placed you in a position aligned with the August 2024 intake.

If you'd like further clarification or assistance regarding this matter, I encourage you to reach out to your career counselor. They will be able to guide you and help you understand the situation better.
18/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 77 673 7538: So this automatically means I have to wait till August??
18/10/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: If you insist on joining the January intake, you can discuss it further with your counselors. However, it will probably end up missing your first semester. And if you want to avoid that, you can proceed with the August 2024 intake. May I know if you are clear here?
18/10/23, 8:52 pm - +263 77 673 7538: I was told I would miss my first semester but do a semester off
18/10/23, 8:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Could you please let me know why you would like to do that?
18/10/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 673 7538: This message was deleted
18/10/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 673 7538: All things being normal, am supposed to be doing second year right now so already am two years behind and adding another half a year to that is depressing please understand
18/10/23, 9:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Since we are already behind the due dates, the next available intake is for August 2024, dear. So for further details, I would like you to please connect with your counselor.
18/10/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Noted
18/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please do let me know when you ar connected with your counselor. <This message was edited>
18/10/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Okay
25/10/23, 4:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Brandon!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you were able to connect with your counselor?
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Good day
25/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 673 7538: It seems like I have no other choice but to wait for August
25/10/23, 8:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that waiting until August is not the ideal situation, but sometimes circumstances require us to adjust our plans.
01/11/23, 4:01 pm - +263 77 476 7145: Good afternoon good people my son is outside the city and there is no network but he will be in the city tomorrow and am sure he will catch up with you as soon as he arrives
02/11/23, 12:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, dear Parents and Brandon.

06/11/23, 2:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed as we begin a new week, hoping to overcome the Monday blues. 


With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
07/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Good afternoon
07/11/23, 1:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to further connect with you by the time that you reached out as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
07/11/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes
07/11/23, 2:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Since you are active now, I wanted to know if you were able to recall our past discussions about the admission process so that we can proceed with the session smoothly?
07/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes
07/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 673 7538: I remember
07/11/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Economics) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
07/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Correct
07/11/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
08/11/23, 5:58 am - +263 77 673 7538: Yes
08/11/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to further connect with you by the time that you reached out as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
08/11/23, 3:04 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes we can
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
08/11/23, 3:52 pm - +263 77 673 7538: No it's not possible
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Correct. Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $750. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
08/11/23, 5:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
08/11/23, 7:08 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes we discussed everything
08/11/23, 7:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
08/11/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes we are together
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
08/11/23, 7:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?
08/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes I have
08/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I will be closing our session for the day now. I would like to let you know that we as a team will not be available from the 9th to the 13th of November and wi be available on the 14th, on the occasion of one of our biggest festivals Diwali, also known as Deepavali, which is a major Indian festival often referred to as the *"Festival of Lights."* It's celebrated by millions of people around the world. The festival is marked by the lighting of lamps and candles inside and outside homes, setting off fireworks, wearing new clothes, sharing sweets and gifts, and gathering with family and friends.
08/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The significance of Diwali varies regionally within India but generally symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil. The lighting of lamps, which is central to the celebration, represents the hope and renewal of light guiding everyone to the right path and is a practice full of symbolism. Diwali is a time for rejoicing and renewal, with prayers offered for prosperity and well-being in the coming year.
08/11/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/11/23, 5:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. Today holds particular significance for us here in India as we celebrate Children's Day, commemorating the birth anniversary of Jawaharlal Nehru on November 14th.

14/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Good day
14/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 673 7538: We had no electricity
15/11/23, 6:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good day! No worries at all. I understand that unforeseen circumstances, such as a power outage, can happen.

How are you and your family doing today?
15/11/23, 7:32 pm - +263 77 673 7538: We are doing okay how are you
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to let you know that I was not able to connect with you today as I was going through a tough time with my work. However, to make up for this I would like be reach out to you tomorrow for further process of the session. 

I hope you have a great night today and my warm wishes to your lovely family.
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Thank you
16/11/23, 8:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening!

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I am now active and prepared to start our session for the day. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
16/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yess
16/11/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Let us proceed
16/11/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
16/11/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance can be paid through monthly installments, providing you with the flexibility to manage your finances effectively and ensure timely payment before the designated due dates.
16/11/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Okay!
16/11/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
16/11/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
16/11/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
16/11/23, 8:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
16/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 673 7538: No queries
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one.
16/11/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.

05/12/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Yes we can proceed
05/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
05/12/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Noted
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
05/12/23, 8:42 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
05/12/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 673 7538: I have gone through them
05/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
05/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
05/12/23, 8:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
05/12/23, 8:54 pm - +263 77 673 7538: That's great!
05/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
05/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
05/12/23, 8:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 8:57 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Wonderful
05/12/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $100 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $100 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $650.
05/12/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $650. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $100 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
05/12/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Understood
05/12/23, 9:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to have our session productively today. However, thank you for being available. I really appreciate you being online with me. As my available hours are coming to an end and it was a long day for me, let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
05/12/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 673 7538: Thank you
05/12/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 673 7538: We'll connect tomorrow
