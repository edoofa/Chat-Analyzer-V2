05/12/23, 10:06 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share your experience in written, I am so excited to hear about that?
05/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 137 6751: Yes, it was an amazing  opportunity really I learnt a lot , I learnt to step out of my comfort zone which is something I rarely get to experience, I was also push into critical thinking (think outside the box) as we we given what we call impromptu motions where we were given 30 mins to prepare without the help of any digital media, I also picked up a lot on how my fellow peers view the current world and its status quo 
Analysis was another key aspect I picked up as in Debate we supposed to show why our teams sides should be preferred as compared to the other
One of the other aspects I picked was as a debator I need to always be updated in terms of world news the happenings and the goings
Above all my favorite was meeting new people and networking..
05/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 137 6751: Thank you
05/12/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: That sounds like a fantastic experience! It's truly enriching to hear about the valuable lessons and skills you gained through this opportunity. Stepping out of your comfort zone, engaging in critical thinking, and honing your analytical abilities are all essential aspects of personal and intellectual growth.
05/12/23, 10:16 am - Saloni Edoofa: The impromptu motions challenge sounds particularly exciting, forcing you to rely on your spontaneous thinking and communication skills.
