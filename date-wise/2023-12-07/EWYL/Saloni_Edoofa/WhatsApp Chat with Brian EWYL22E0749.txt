The Impact of a $300 Grant on Recruiting Students into the Edoofa Scholarship Program

Education is a powerful tool that can transform lives and uplift communities. The Edoofa Scholarship Program has played a crucial role in ensuring that deserving students have access to quality education, irrespective of their financial background. The Edoofa scholarship program, dedicated to supporting talented students, aims to harness the potential of a $300 for each   student I will recruit into its fold, creating a positive ripple effect on education and society.

 Many talented students often face financial barriers that prevent them from pursuing higher education. The $300 grant from the Edoofa scholarship program serves as a stepping stone, mitigating these financial challenges and allowing deserving students to enter the education landscape.

So this  $300 will be divided accordingly depending on how the recruited student will be paying the enrollment fee, registration and also when the student finally come to India. Si I will be getting $100 when the student complete the full enrollment fee of $350, then another $100 when the student pay the registration fee and finally another $100 when the student finally arrive in India.
21/08/23, 3:35 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to hear this and I would want that as parent @27711997204 also acknowledges that.
21/08/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Brian, it was an amazing call with you and yes as discussed over the call I would appreciate you to share two things with me:

▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

▪️Your understanding of the $300 plan as explained over the call. (already done)

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.
21/08/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/08/23, 3:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: A handwritten letter can be something like this (this is just a sample for you, don't copy-paste anything)
The letter has to be completely based on your personal experience
21/08/23, 3:37 pm - +27 62 062 8751: Yes ms thank you
21/08/23, 3:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Brian I have talked to the Academic Board of Edoofa and they have agreed to give you the grant but the condition is that first, they will observe you for one month if you are regular with me and consistently work on projects, then you will be given the grant.
Rest all the students went through a rigorous 21-day grant challenge and in that, they had to submit 45 forms and 3 schools. So, if I give you a similar task and then if completed, I will approve your name of the grant.
21/08/23, 3:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Do you accept this challenge?
21/08/23, 4:00 pm - +27 62 062 8751: Yes ms I will try to do that!
22/08/23, 12:34 pm - +27 62 062 8751: <Media omitted>
22/08/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Brian!
How are you?
22/08/23, 12:37 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am truly touched by your heartfelt letter, and I want to commend you for sharing your incredible journey as an Edoofian. Your words are not just a reflection of your gratitude but also a testament to your dedication and enthusiasm.

Edoofa has played a significant role in transforming your dreams into reality. Your story of how Edoofa made studying abroad a reality for you is inspiring. Your commitment to demonstrating your appreciation through actions speaks volumes about your character and determination. As you mentioned, making a difference is a core principle, and I do not doubt that you will do just that.

I am deeply moved by the regard that you have given to me, thank you for that. I think a mentor is nothing without its bright students and I am blessed to have a student like you.

I am sure with the opportunity given, you will continue doing your best.
Thank you

11/10/23, 3:25 pm - +91 81461 59638: Noted, Ms. Saloni.
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So to ensure the same, we are planning that all the students whose forms you will share, will be shown your video *highlighting your journey and experience*. There we would be required to make a short video on the same.
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.
11/10/23, 3:39 pm - +91 81461 59638: I am following.
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
11/10/23, 3:49 pm - +91 81461 59638: Understood ma'am

08/11/23, 2:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Thank you Brian and same to you!
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Brian tell me, what is the update on the Community Building project?
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - +91 81461 59638: Ma'am my parents are asking they want to know how much scholarship credits I have for now
08/11/23, 2:52 pm - +91 81461 59638: I will give you at least 2 forms today
08/11/23, 3:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So far you have earned $207 as your scholarship credits. Since out of $350 of the enrollment fees, you paid $263 as your enrollment fees and you are still obliged to pay the balance enrollment fees. Therefore we adjusted the balance from your scholarship credits and currently, you have $120 as your redeemable scholarship credits.
08/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 81461 59638: I cleared all the enrollment fee ma'am. I paid $150+ $63 =$213. Which means from 350 the balance was 137 which was cleared through scholarship credits ma'am
08/11/23, 3:20 pm - Saloni Edoofa: We will end our session here and I would like to wish you a _very happy Diwali_. I hope that your academic year, health, wealth, and love just grow and flourish 🪔

08/11/23, 3:32 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me get in touch with the DSW Team then.
08/11/23, 3:37 pm - +91 81461 59638: Okay thank you
09/11/23, 1:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 4:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni
