Like I have always said and that you have dearly followed too, we both wish to transform the journey of hundreds of other students along with us and inspire them with the ability that we have.

1. A professional picture of yours
2. A write-up, your story where you will be telling about how you started, the challenges, how are you doing it, and where you are right now
3. We would be requiring your credits redemption emails that we would be featuring and show how the term 'self-finance' is actually true in the Edoofa dictionary. You can forward all your previous credit redemption mails to me on my mail id of saloni.edoofa@gmail.com

04/09/23, 11:45 am - +91 83600 51647: I never had hope that one day i will be counted with those who were blessed enough to study in India.  It never even came to me as a dream but here i am quoting it as a dream come true. It wasnt all candy from the beginning i also faced financial issues, self doubt on whether i will make it, where to start but cut long story short here i am.  Some of the challenges were uplifted through the Edoofa EWYL were i worked hard to earn myself notifiable credits and even though its difficult i will keep the fighting spirit.
04/09/23, 12:16 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Wow , this is splendid, I am so happy to have this 💯🫶🏻

How are you?
04/10/23, 3:27 pm - Saloni Edoofa: As I mentioned in the call about the video, it should share entirely about your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.

Please include:
a) Your journey so far with the program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
