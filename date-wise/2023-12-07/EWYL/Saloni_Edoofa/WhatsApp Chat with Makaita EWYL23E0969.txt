Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
04/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I hope that it will be

How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 77 294 9349: Good afternoon
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes please

05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you!
05/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Makaita, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I want to attain a masters and EWYL program will assist in that because it reduces the burden of paying fees on my parents.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great because I am there with you on this journey and I will make sure you achieve these goals.
05/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 245 5997: Good afternoon. Iam Rabson Mudavanhu, Makaita's father.
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Can you explain them please
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello sir, how are you doing?
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I understand
05/12/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 245 5997: I am very well, thank you and how are you?
05/12/23, 2:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
05/12/23, 2:06 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I read it
05/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what have you understood from it?
05/12/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 871 0042: With your assistance,he was able to maximize his gain from the EWYL program and he also acquired skills along the way
05/12/23, 2:23 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I am sure you will be able to score more and really high!
05/12/23, 2:24 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

05/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Ok ma'am ,enjoy the rest of your day
05/12/23, 2:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You too, Makaita
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

May we begin with our session🌟
06/12/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Afternoon ma'am,I'm good and you ... Yes,we can start
06/12/23, 1:43 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
06/12/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Welcome
06/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
06/12/23, 1:46 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I'm glad to know you ma'am and happy that we share a similar passion in  art
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
06/12/23, 1:53 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes I did
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
06/12/23, 1:54 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Sounds interesting, right?*
06/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Yes,can't wait. Anxious about what will be me first task.... It's intriguing actually.
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is awesome!
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I'm done ma'am
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
06/12/23, 2:15 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I love the first quote because it's similar to what my grandmother used to tell me..."Just because it didn't work, doesn't mean it's the wrong choice. The world is full of probabilities,not certainties....."
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am glad to hear that you could resemble the same and yes, it is just one of the hundreds of newsletters. You will soon receive a lot in the coming future🌟
06/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 871 0042: I will be impatiently waiting
06/12/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
06/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 871 0042: Loved the chat and enjoy your day ma'am
06/12/23, 2:42 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You too, Makaita!
