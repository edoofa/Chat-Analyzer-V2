Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸

13/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I want you to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and focus on your exams. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.
13/09/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Deepali, Head of Department, and me stating that:

16/09/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM* every week⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

I will be conducting the session *today, 20 September 2023* from *02:30 to 03:30 PM*⏳ as planned. _It's essential that either the child or a parent is present during the session._

Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session later today.

Let's begin with our sessions 💥
27/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 77 363 8320: How are you?We had some network challenges. Sorry to respond late.
27/09/23, 10:43 am - Saloni Edoofa: No worries, I understand that.
27/09/23, 10:44 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Resistance can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
27/09/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 363 8320: Sure we are on the same track
27/09/23, 1:04 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now our scheduled session will be happening on *Wednesday* from *09:30 AM - 11:00 AM*⏳ next week.

How are you?

May we begin with our session?
04/10/23, 9:41 am - +263 77 363 8320: We are fine.Yes we can proceed
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
04/10/23, 9:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
04/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
04/10/23, 9:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
04/10/23, 9:57 am - +263 77 363 8320: Sounds exciting. Well understood.
04/10/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once done, do let me know

21/11/23, 10:43 am - +263 77 422 3065: On the document below..l have understood that the edoofa ewyl program provides higher education with affordable prices
Whilst Covid affected the world including children education, edoofa was there ...it  acquired skills that were instrumental in one's inspirations in reaching career goals 
Edoofa did a lot by installing  online skills for instance networking, business development and so on..these skills are still used    today..the ewyl helps to lower the expenses after the scholarship credits..the ewyl program reduces parents burden on finances

21/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!

21/11/23, 10:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: You have explained it really well, and this will help you in understanding the further projects in depth.
21/11/23, 11:03 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will end the session for today but I am hoping to catch you tomorrow from 10:00 - 11:00 AM in the EWYL Group🏆

22/11/23, 10:05 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Resistance,
How are you doing?

22/11/23, 10:14 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
22/11/23, 10:14 am - +263 77 422 3065: Okay sure
22/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 422 3065: l have understood that when  searching for companies  one should  look at the nature of the company..the company should be student centric or platform centric for example for recreational 
Secondly one should look and the scale of the company it should be either to big or too small,it can vary from 50-200
Thirdly one should look at the financial stability
Fourthly the background of the founder of the company looking at how successful he is...this can be seen  at linkedin ,Facebook or other social  media pages

When searching the companies there are Stepps that should be followed 
Step1  start connecting with  founders, getting information about employees to get update
Step2 after getting some information one should Google and find more information 
Step3 one is required to  study the website of the company
Step 4 one will be checking  the various social media pages of the company to get the idea of the activities and  the functioning status  of the company 
Step 5 one study background of the founder and the core members,the best source that can be used is linkedin 
Step6 after checking their backgrounds ,one therefore drops an invitation note  before connecting with the founders
22/11/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: You know what Resistance, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
22/11/23, 10:45 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –

24/11/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Resistance!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
24/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 422 3065: l'm fine and you Mentor
24/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 422 3065: Yes we can begin
24/11/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you!
24/11/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
24/11/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Resistance/Saloni/24NOV2023*
24/11/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
24/11/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
24/11/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
24/11/23, 10:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
24/11/23, 10:22 am - +263 77 422 3065: Okay mentor noted
24/11/23, 10:24 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share a brief summary of what you have understood from the process?
24/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 77 422 3065: We have Step whereby lam suppose to form whatsapp group and l have to name the student name / mentor name  and date the group was formed
24/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
24/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
24/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
24/11/23, 10:34 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
24/11/23, 10:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

I hope you got my point.

28/11/23, 10:32 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that electricity issues and connectivity gaps are not in our hands but I would suggest that you either use the hotspot facility for connecting with me or use someone else device for connecting.
I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth is our priority right.
28/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 77 422 3065: Okay l understand
28/11/23, 10:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!

29/11/23, 10:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Let me help you with the kind of communication that you should do with the school heads, okay?

Q1. Please mention the name of your school. Is your school connected with Edoofa?
Q2. Please share the messages that you will use when you reach out to the School Heads.
Q3. Name of the Province where your school is located.
29/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 422 3065: 1.Rushinga high school..noo it's not connected 
2.l will use WhatsApp messages and phone calss

29/11/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.
29/11/23, 10:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.
There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to any teacher or student at School with whom you are in touch and ask him/her for your School Head’s Contact.
29/11/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 422 3065: Mr Murenga.vcf (file attached)
29/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that you have the School Head’s Contact, It is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.
29/11/23, 10:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career.
29/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: _So, This is what the First message should look like:_
29/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Mr./Mrs *School Head Name*!
Hope you are doing well.

I am *Your Name* and I am a beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
I stand obliged to get an opportunity to connect with you, I hope to have a result/conclusion-driven conversation with you today.

May I know at what time you will be available to connect via Whatsapp?
29/11/23, 10:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you get a response from the school head about their available time, do let me know so that I can share some valuable resources with you.
29/11/23, 10:51 am - +263 77 422 3065: Okay mentor noted
29/11/23, 10:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, Resistance- we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL.

30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: So now we are ready to move to move to an amazing journey🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please note a few things:
FIRST- Please note that your session will be on:

*TUESDAY and FRIDAY* from 12:00 - 01:30 PM
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions (*TUESDAY and FRIDAY*), we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
30/11/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
