19/09/23, 2:43 pm - Sharda Edoofa: So, you are already aware of the EWYL Program. If so, can you provide me with some information about it?

19/09/23, 4:13 pm - +260 97 5210212: This message was deleted
19/09/23, 4:30 pm - +260 97 5210212: It is an Edoofa backbone program to make university education affordable. Basically a student is given live online projects, during which they gain excellent work experience while earning credits equivalent to physical cash based on students performance.Then the credits are used to pay a significant part of higher education fee.
20/09/23, 2:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well

Kindly connect with within our scheduled time so that we can finish our training and discussion.
It is important that we respect the scheduled timing.

May I also know what is the exact challenge that you are not able to connect with me at our scheduled time?
20/09/23, 8:30 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning Sharda,I thought you already knew that  Hope is in school now and they are not allowed to use phones.I am the mother, i am a nurse so sometimes it's difficult to attend to the agreed engagement time  because of the nature of my work otherwise I will try or if it's ok we can reschedule 8pm -10pm.
20/09/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: I understand your concern Ma'am. But shifting the timing to 8pm-10pm will not be possible at my end as there is a time difference of 3 and a half hours in India.

Also, regarding being late for the sessions. I have a scheduled timing for the sessions and then i get occupied in some other work. 
But, do not worry. If you want we can connect from 9:30 am in the morning if that suits you?
20/09/23, 9:02 am - +260 97 5210212: Ok I'll try to avail my self
20/09/23, 9:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay Ma'am Noted.
20/09/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
20/09/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
20/09/23, 9:12 am - +260 97 5210212: I go for the first slot, will try my best to attend. But for now Hope may will not come back home until month-end November,so I don't know if I can still attend the session for her.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, you can aatend the basic training sessions for her. When she will be back we can start discussion with her as well.
20/09/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: This is a brief 3 day long  session specially for parents and you can brief her later.
20/09/23, 9:23 am - +260 97 5210212: Ok am set, thanks
21/09/23, 8:36 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well

Are you ready for the session?
21/09/23, 8:39 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning Sharda,yes I am ready
21/09/23, 8:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/09/23, 8:48 am - +260 97 5210212: Kindly enlighten
21/09/23, 9:09 am - +260 97 5210212: Maybe to help students gain experience while they learn and help students earn credits that are equivalent to physical cash used to pay for their university education. Y
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Hope is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
21/09/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
21/09/23, 9:55 am - +260 97 5210212: I have read through and I have understood
21/09/23, 9:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
21/09/23, 9:58 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
21/09/23, 9:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 10:08 am - +260 97 5210212: That's was great, and how much time did it take?
21/09/23, 10:11 am - +260 97 5210212: Does the number of credits depend on the type of tasks given or they are  earned regardless
22/09/23, 8:44 am - +260 97 5210212: Good morning
22/09/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning 
I hope you are doing well

Are you available for the session?
22/09/23, 8:55 am - Sharda Edoofa: Number of credits are fixed for each task.
If a student performs, then he/she is given the credits.
22/09/23, 9:07 am - +260 97 5210212: Thanks,yes I am available
22/09/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
22/09/23, 9:09 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
22/09/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
22/09/23, 9:10 am - Sharda Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Hope* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
22/09/23, 9:16 am - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion?
22/09/23, 9:29 am - +260 97 5210212: Yes sounds interesting and gives room to attend to other activities

22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Okay
22/09/23, 10:02 am - Sharda Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Hope* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

22/09/23, 10:04 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Hope* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!

25/09/23, 9:13 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits

2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency

25/09/23, 9:25 am - Sharda Edoofa: Since I want *Hope* to have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your exams.
25/09/23, 9:26 am - Sharda Edoofa: If this is the case then as per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:

By the way, Dussehra, a significant Hindu festival, just happened recently. It's a celebration of good triumphing over evil, and it's a time for joy and reflection. I'd appreciate your insights if you were already familiar with this festival.
Wishing you all the best in your exams.

I have noticed your unresponsiveness in the group. I would like to understand if everything is alright at your end. 

We're delighted to share that some of our students have been actively engaging in extracurricular activities, such as a recent basketball tournament, where they showcased their skills and teamwork.

Additionally, I am excited to inform you that after our students come to India, we also host regular gatherings where students come together, enjoy conversations, and even sing together. These events provide a warm sense of community, and our *Edoofa Welfare officer* joins in to make them even more special.

I am keen to know about your preferences as well. What kind of activities would you like to get involved in after coming to India? Whether it's sports, cultural events, or any other interests, please share your thoughts.
