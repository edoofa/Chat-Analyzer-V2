So, are you ready to start our session?
10/08/23, 8:40 am - +91 85568 02877: Yes please
10/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: wonderful
10/08/23, 8:43 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
10/08/23, 8:51 am - +91 85568 02877: What are they
10/08/23, 8:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
10/08/23, 8:54 am - Sharda Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
10/08/23, 8:55 am - +91 85568 02877: OK ok
I understand
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Wonderful Rhoda
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*.
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: *Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
10/08/23, 8:57 am - +91 85568 02877: OK sure
10/08/23, 8:57 am - Sharda Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts
10/08/23, 8:58 am - +91 85568 02877: OK ok
Thank you
10/08/23, 8:59 am - Sharda Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
10/08/23, 8:59 am - +91 85568 02877: Ok sure
10/08/23, 9:01 am - Sharda Edoofa: 1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
10/08/23, 9:03 am - +91 85568 02877: OK sue
Thank you
I will
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: How does that sound,  Rhoda?
10/08/23, 9:03 am - Sharda Edoofa: Yess, this should be the spirit !
10/08/23, 9:04 am - +91 85568 02877: That's great and l really that
10/08/23, 9:42 am - +91 85568 02877: *like
14/08/23, 8:32 am - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings, Scholar!
A wonderful day to you

I'm thrilled to welcome you to today's scheduled session
Are you ready for it?
14/08/23, 8:33 am - +91 85568 02877: Thank you
Sure
14/08/23, 8:52 am - Sharda Edoofa: So, how are you Rhoda?
14/08/23, 9:32 am - +91 85568 02877: I am fine
14/08/23, 9:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now, Typically, at this stage, we would delve into discussing the projects that you will undertake to earn credits. However, considering your ongoing VISA process and the additional documentation you'll be occupied with, I can totally understand your situation that you will be heavily busy and also you would have to travel a lot due to the documentation, so as your mentor, I would not want to overburden you with the projects at this time as I want your full focus and dedication towards EWYL journey so to ensure your thorough understanding of the projects, it would be more convenient to commence your EWYL journey after you arrive in India.
14/08/23, 9:33 am - Sharda Edoofa: By adopting this approach, we guarantee that you will have a lot of time and unwavering focus to work on the projects, enabling you to extract the utmost value from your EWYL experience. Moreover, I am thrilled to inform you that I eagerly anticipate your arrival, as it promises to enhance the overall excitement and success of your journey. Rest assured, we are committed to ensuring that your EWYL experience is flawlessly executed, convenient, and maximally efficient.
14/08/23, 9:34 am - Sharda Edoofa: That concludes my input for today! 


Wishing you a wonderful day ahead.


I look forward to connecting with you again tomorrow at our scheduled time.
14/08/23, 9:41 am - +91 85568 02877: OK thank you

In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.

03/10/23, 8:17 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*
03/10/23, 8:20 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:51 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:00-06:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
10/10/23, 6:26 pm - +91 85568 02877: OK no problem
10/10/23, 6:26 pm - +91 85568 02877: We are fine and you

I hope you are doing well

I have observed your unavailability in your EWYL Group. You have not responded to even one message which is bothersome.

I hope you understand that I take extra time out of my schedule just to check your performance and share reminders to you so that you do not miss out on any opportunity that other students are receiving by being responsive and available on a regular and timely basis. 

I hope you consider this a priority I encourage you to share your concerns transparently with me so that I can explain the objective of our interactions in the first place.
03/11/23, 3:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good evening *Rhoda*
I hope you are doing well.

06/11/23, 8:21 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning, Rhoda
I hope you are doing well.

Since we had our call scheduled on Saturday and you got the message for the same. I would like to understand the reason behind you not being available for the call.

Also, as you must already be aware about our planned schedule for our calls and sessions that was established well in advance. Hence it is challenging to continually adjust and reschedule our timetable.

Given the fact that I don't want you to miss out on any valuable learning, I'm open to reconsidering our schedule only for this time. I *would like to reschedule our call to 6:20 pm today.*

Kindly confirm your availability for this new time? <This message was edited>

 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a *Diwali Activity*.

25/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Rhoda, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
