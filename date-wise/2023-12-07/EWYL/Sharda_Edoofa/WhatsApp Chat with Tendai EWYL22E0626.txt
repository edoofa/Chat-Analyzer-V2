I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to inform you that there has been a slight change in plans. Instead of having our session tomorrow, I will be conducting it today from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm. The reason for this change is that I'll be on leave tomorrow as my mother has come to town, and I'd like to spend some time with her.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but I assure you that we will cover all the necessary topics during our session today. Please submit your Understanding of the Lesson before the session. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me.

Thank you for your understanding, and I'm looking forward to our session today.

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 10:00am CAT AND 1:30PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

24/08/23, 4:00 pm - +91 78273 08969: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
24/08/23, 4:04 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you
24/08/23, 4:10 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
24/08/23, 4:11 pm - +91 78273 08969: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
24/08/23, 4:10 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Yes ma'am
24/08/23, 4:14 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you
24/08/23, 4:14 pm - +91 78273 08969: Also, I want to emphasize that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
24/08/23, 4:15 pm - +27 74 055 9953: I would really appreciate that
24/08/23, 4:17 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.

24/08/23, 4:19 pm - +91 78273 08969: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
24/08/23, 4:27 pm - +27 74 055 9953: I will surely sing n submit it
24/08/23, 4:28 pm - +91 78273 08969: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant.

She will discuss your session timings and lay out your EWYL journey plan. she has extensive experience, having successfully guided over 300 students, particularly in communications, public speaking, relationship building, and coaching. I'm excited that you'll be in capable hands.

My decision doesn't reflect any doubt in your potential or abilities. I have full faith that you will continue to excel in your educational journey and achieve your goals. Please embrace this change with an open heart, as I'm confident you'll find great value in Ms. Sharda's guidance.

Thank you for allowing me to be part of your journey. I'll be cheering you on as you continue to thrive.

Best wishes.

10/10/23, 3:53 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 3:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳06:45-08:00 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello *Tendai*, I hope you're doing well today. It's always a pleasure to connect with you for our mentoring sessions. 🌟
Are you ready for it?
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Hello ma'am  yes can we adjust it to 8 pm ma'am coz right now I'm coming I'm coming from practice from school
11/10/23, 3:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 8:00pm gets very late for me since my working hours end by then.
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Fantastic! Let's make this session a productive one. To begin, I'd like to hear about your Project work Update.

Now, let's shift attention to the three projects we've been discussing, particularly the 
Community Building Project.
11/10/23, 3:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now that you have submitted the student application forms/ sooner or later be submitting  them for the Community Building Project  - 

Please  make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even the admission stages.
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - +27 74 055 9953: OK ma'am
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies that his/her friend did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.

To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 
*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Along with that make sure you are giving them an explanation about your journey, about the benefits that you have got and about the skills that you will be acquiring in the process.
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - +27 74 055 9953: OK ma'am I will keep it in mind
11/10/23, 3:56 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you for the heads up
11/10/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please!
11/10/23, 4:13 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *Since you are aware that we have our call scheduled on this saturday, please make sure you complete this task by 12:00pm on Friday.*
11/10/23, 4:14 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *You have to make your testimonial video after arriving in India that should include:*
a) Your journey so far with the Edoofa Scholarship Program,
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) Highlighting the importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your initial feedback on how life is different in India, how their basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland (For example - Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying on your own through an agent and struggling with the process. 
f) Your university experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.
11/10/23, 4:57 pm - +27 74 055 9953: OK ma'am
13/10/23, 1:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are doing well

I have recorded the student application form that you submitted.
25/11/23, 1:32 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you
25/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: you are welcome please!
25/11/23, 3:32 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Hello Tendai, 

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.

Best regards,
Team EWYL
27/11/23, 9:05 am - +27 74 055 9953: Greetings to you maam
27/11/23, 9:11 am - +27 74 055 9953: Ma'am i have a student called Thandiwe Mhaka she joined edoofa and she was in the process of paying enrollment fee  and she wasn't able to because her family gets money according to session and she haven't had from edoofa since 8 October
27/11/23, 9:19 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good morning Tendai!
How are you?

Exciting news – the eagerly awaited discussion on the *Grant 2023* guidelines to discuss your performance and eligibility, is finally here! *Today*, we invite you and your parents to join the session from *06:00 - 07:00 PM Indian Time or 02:30 - 03:30 PM CAT.* Your presence will be precious 🤝
27/11/23, 9:20 am - Sharda Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your concern, I will get back to you.
27/11/23, 9:21 am - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you ma'am i will be there
27/11/23, 9:22 am - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you
27/11/23, 10:14 am - +27 61 195 8641: Hw are you mum? Ok thanks
27/11/23, 10:56 am - +27 74 055 9953: According to my understanding  "spirit of competition" is the idea that competition can be a positive force in our lives. It's the belief that competition can motivate us to push ourselves to achieve our goals and be our best selves. It's the idea that competition can bring out the best in us, and help us to grow and improve. It's not about winning or losing, but about striving for excellence and giving it our all. The spirit of competition is about celebrating the journey, rather than just the outcome.  As i can link with my personal life i remember she we had to participate and present on a certain topic in school to our bishop  i remember we were different team but the goal was not just to win but  to bring the best out of what we were going to present to the bishop
27/11/23, 2:35 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Hello ma'am
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good Evening, Tendai!

 I am so excited to finally bring out the much-awaited opportunity that you have been waiting for! This is a wonderful time for me as a mentor as a lot of my students are in the process of making use of the Edoofa Grant that was allocated before the start of this academic year and I am sure that you would be curious too.
27/11/23, 2:39 pm - +27 74 055 9953: yes ma'am im so curious
27/11/23, 2:40 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $200 annually. 
Do you remember this?
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Yes ma'am i do reremember this
27/11/23, 2:44 pm - +27 74 407 8200: Afternoon Mrs Sharda
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Good afternoon dear parent
27/11/23, 2:48 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Excellent Tendai, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
27/11/23, 2:49 pm - +27 74 055 9953: I recall some
27/11/23, 2:50 pm - +27 74 407 8200: Thank you ma'am, I am happy to join you on this crucial meeting
27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Yes i do i went through them
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: You are most welcome.
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: let me help you out on this,
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes.
27/11/23, 2:55 pm - Sharda Edoofa: 3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University only if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
27/11/23, 2:56 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Note: You can redeem either one of the two - Grant or Scholarship Credits, whichever is higher.
27/11/23, 2:57 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you ma'am 
But may I please know how many scholarship credits i have
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes I am going to tell you the same in a while.
27/11/23, 3:00 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
27/11/23, 3:01 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Thank you ma'am
27/11/23, 3:04 pm - Sharda Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
27/11/23, 3:05 pm - +27 74 055 9953: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible. 

As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
27/11/23, 3:41 pm - Sharda Edoofa: o make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at
27/11/23, 3:42 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Criteria	September + October
Webinar	2/6
Attendance	6/6
Orientation	Present
Fee status	Clear
27/11/23, 3:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: are you there in the session?
27/11/23, 3:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Are you following the discussion, Tadiwanashe
27/11/23, 4:02 pm - +27 74 055 9953: yes maam im following 
sorry I was having problem with network 
maam the name is Tendai matimati
27/11/23, 4:10 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Yes I am aware. Kindly excuse me for the technical glitch.
27/11/23, 4:11 pm - Sharda Edoofa: To avoid being confused, we have not included your performance in the month of November as it is still ongoing.

Now that we are on the same page, as of the months of Sept & Oct, you are not eligible to make use of your grant amount. However, that does not mean that you don't get to be eligible anymore. With our collaborative efforts, we can bridge this gap very easily and I have full faith in you.  I hope you have realized from our conversations earlier that the only aspect required here is your engagement with me and following the path that I am directing you to. Do you believe that you are ready to put your 100% effort into this?
27/11/23, 4:13 pm - +27 74 055 9953: yes maam
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I also want to highlight a special case -  one of our students has earned $102.0____ as scholarship credits and I sincerely want to appreciate  him for the same. Isn’t it amazing?
27/11/23, 4:15 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Do you know why I shared this with you? Because I want you to think of the long-term picture, you might be in a position to use these credits for the coming term, but what about next year, next to next year?
27/11/23, 4:16 pm - +27 74 055 9953: that's really amazing
27/11/23, 4:17 pm - +27 74 055 9953: thats amzing
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents to fullest_
27/11/23, 4:19 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Have a look at this so that we can discuss how you can achieve it
27/11/23, 4:21 pm - +27 74 055 9953: thank u
27/11/23, 4:22 pm - +27 74 055 9953: ok

27/11/23, 4:33 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Witnessing your current progress and the credits you're earning is truly inspiring. It gives me confidence that you have untapped potential that can truly turn the tables in their favor. I firmly believe in your ability to reach greater heights.
By actively engaging with the mentor through sessions and calls, you have the potential to earn more with every coming academic year.You have the capability not only to alleviate the current financial load but also to pave the way for a future where education becomes a self-financed journey. This isn't just about credits; it's about empowering you to shape a brighter educational and financial future and that I believe, is incomplete without consistent communication and consistency.
27/11/23, 4:34 pm - +27 74 055 9953: thats very true maam
27/11/23, 4:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Concluding our session, I want to say it's been an amazing conversation, and I can't wait for our next one.
