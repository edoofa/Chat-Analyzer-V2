27/03/23, 9:05 am - Jasmine Edoofa created group "Shalom EWYL23E0026"
27/03/23, 9:05 am - You were added
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:28 am - +263 71 584 8678: Morning how are you? 
We can continue
15/09/23, 9:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:40 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Shalom, If you will be able to come to the session every day from 8:30 am to 9:30 am. Then I would really appreciate
15/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 71 584 8678: I think option 2 is suitable
15/09/23, 9:45 am - +263 71 584 8678: I will be free on Tuesday upto Friday from 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm
16/09/23, 8:22 am - +263 71 584 8678: Good morning
18/09/23, 2:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Shalom is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
18/09/23, 2:34 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Understood
18/09/23, 2:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Understood
18/09/23, 2:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Nice to know her
18/09/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Nice to meet them
18/09/23, 2:47 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Shalom to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.e The students will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Yes
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
18/09/23, 2:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Finished
18/09/23, 3:04 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, The entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/09/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 584 8678: I wish to be celebrated
18/09/23, 3:09 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Shalom's  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Shalom? <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 3:11 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Sounds good
18/09/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Shalom will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 9:32 pm - +263 71 674 2588: Good evening,I deposited your $50 today
19/09/23, 4:27 am - +263 71 674 2588: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 4:27 am - +263 71 674 2588: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 11:07 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 584 8678: I'm doing well.
Yes, I'm ready for that session
19/09/23, 12:51 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 1:05 pm - +263 71 584 8678: I'm doing good
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I believe you have shared this in the wrong group.
19/09/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Yes
19/09/23, 1:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, let us continue
19/09/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Okay
19/09/23, 1:12 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Shalom can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
19/09/23, 1:13 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Yes
19/09/23, 1:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Shalom is available? If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
19/09/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 584 8678: I'm available. I choose option 2
19/09/23, 1:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we are ready to begin our new journey
Please note a few things:

FIRST- From now onwards, you will have your sessions on
TUESDAY and FRIDAY
19/09/23, 1:18 pm - +263 71 584 8678: On what time
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I will share the timings later Shalom
19/09/23, 1:19 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
19/09/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Noted
19/09/23, 1:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
19/09/23, 1:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
19/09/23, 1:32 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Okay so I'm not supposed to reply to this group starting from now
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This group will be for passing on information whereas sessions will be conducted on EWYL LINE from now.
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FOURTH- You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Jasmine, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
19/09/23, 1:34 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Understood
19/09/23, 1:35 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Noted
19/09/23, 1:35 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: FIFTH- Every day you have to come and say "I am a proud EDOOFIAN' on the EWYL line.
19/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Noted
19/09/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
19/09/23, 1:41 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Understood
19/09/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now you can text on the Line and I will get back to you there in a while.
19/09/23, 1:45 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Okay
19/09/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, It was lovely talking to you. Have a great day ahead!
19/09/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Thanks
20/09/23, 8:44 am - Jasmine Edoofa: _*Good Morning my dear student*_

29/09/23, 7:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning Shalom, 
I hope you are doing good
29/09/23, 7:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Congratulations on submitting 2 forms Shalom. Your proactive approach has truly brightened my morning, and I am very proud of your outstanding efforts. Well done, Shalom🌟
29/09/23, 7:57 am - Jasmine Edoofa: However, I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 
By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.
29/09/23, 10:30 am - +263 71 584 8678: Okay .

29/09/23, 11:11 am - +263 71 584 8678: I have a question concerned about the lessons of Wednesday and Saturday, do they contribute any to my scholarship credit
30/09/23, 12:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Shalom
No, Wednesday Lesson and Saturday activities don't directly contribute to your scholarship credits but they indirectly help to analyze your overall performance. 
If a student is regular in the sessions and completes all the lessons and activities on time, we prefer that student for future opportunities that contribute to helping students earn more credits.
30/09/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 584 8678: Afternoon how are you
Okay, understood

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement. So, *_I won't be available on Monday_*

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian, I'm thrilled to share that we're in the midst of Diwali, the Festival of Lights.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings🕯️

_*Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.*_

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨
