Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day! ☺️

29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

I have to go attend to something.

28/09/23, 11:06 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Takudzwa, from the complete discussion that we have had today. I am slightly dissapointed. It's been more than a month but we haven't even connected for a single video call. 

Also, I believe that you were not there at the orientation also. Shall I assume that you are not interested to participate in the Earn While You Learn Program? If there is any other reason then feel free to talk Takudzwa.
28/09/23, 12:36 pm - +91 86991 64485: No it's not the way it looks like, it's because you don't know my struggles , you were not there for me  when l was stranded and confused . Silence does not mean lm arrogant or l don't want to participate but l have been trying to cover up for my classes . I missed 22 lessons whilst l blocked from classes so l have a lot of work to do , l  am trying to cover my syllabus so that l won't be left behind .

Also, I'd like to encourage you to share your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.
*Please submit your reflections and success stories before our upcoming session. Thank you for your participation, and I look forward to reading your valuable insights.*
