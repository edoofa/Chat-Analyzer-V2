23/08/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 956 1557: thank you sir
23/08/23, 9:14 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
23/08/23, 9:22 am - +263 78 956 1557: yes sir I  do
23/08/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great, tell me then!
23/08/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 956 1557: Help the student  get enrolled in  a good  educational  facility and be able achieve  his dreams ...right
23/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
23/08/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
23/08/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 956 1557: Noted and understood thank you for the enlightenment.
23/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
23/08/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
23/08/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 956 1557: I have read the same
23/08/23, 9:49 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
23/08/23, 10:06 am - +263 78 956 1557: Thank you guys for embarking on this journey with me... It's good to know  that l have support from the professionals

24/08/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask why are you late today? Are you facing any challenges?

24/08/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
24/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 956 1557: This message was deleted
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
24/08/23, 9:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian.

15/09/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Elshaddai

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 8:46 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm*

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on:
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

18/09/23, 8:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263789561557 @263772483564 

I was expecting a response from your end. May I ask if you are facing any challenges?
19/09/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, may I ask if you were able to decide?
19/09/23, 1:51 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Today lovely will update u after my meeting at work
19/09/23, 1:52 pm - +263 77 248 3564: Will be able to see my timetable

21/09/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 77 248 3564: Yes
21/09/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I believe you must have gone through the document, right?
21/09/23, 8:50 am - +263 77 248 3564: No I hadn't  m sure the student had worked on t before he left
21/09/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, so Elshaddai must have read it.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 12:00 pm  to 1:30 pm
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/09/23, 8:53 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 77 248 3564: Ok
21/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, may I ask when Elshaddai will be available?
21/09/23, 9:03 am - +263 77 248 3564: He will be back after his exams in November
21/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Since I want that you have a full focus on our sessions with me without compromising your time in school, it would be best if we could hold our sessions and you focus on your school. I am doing this solely because you mentioned the pressure you are going through and the paucity of time you are facing to give to your EWYL Program sessions with me.

Let us begin our today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 956 1557: Well it's a document with different ideas on how find a perfect company tha has a potential to collaborate with Edoofar.When looking for such companies there are certain factors one must consider these factors may include,The nature of the company at this point one want to understand if the company is student centric , recreational centric or content centic.
Another factor to also consider is the scale of the company  the scale should keep according to the employee size20-500  and shouldn't be either too big or too small
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 956 1557: To add, one should also find out if the company is financially stable  and this can be checked on thier media
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 956 1557: Then  we go on to study the background of the company and it's founder this is crucially important as it helps one to have important knowledge on the goal of the company and also whre it will be in the future.
Lastly, one must also consider the platforms used by the company to get in touch with it's clients and use the platforms to get a better understanding of the company itself.
06/12/23, 9:01 am - +263 78 956 1557: Mentor Anaya I just want to personally  thank you for your patient and faith in me the reason I haven't  been able to connect recently is because   I just lost my Uncle he passed on, on Sunday and so it needed me to there .The guy is being buried Today but l chose not to go cause I felt like l would be straining all your energy  and therefore am ready for what this session is going to give
