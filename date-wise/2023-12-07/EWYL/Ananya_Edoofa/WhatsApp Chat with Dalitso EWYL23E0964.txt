01/12/23, 4:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>

01/12/23, 4:54 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Okay looking forward to it
04/12/23, 1:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let's start our session with an interesting tidbit about India. Did you know that the concept of 'zero' (0) as a mathematical digit was invented by Indian mathematician Aryabhata?

It's a remarkable contribution that has had a profound impact on mathematics and science globally. 🤯
04/12/23, 2:00 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon. 

I never knew about that. That’s true it has a major contribution not only in math but in computer programming as well
04/12/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dalitso, may I ask why are you late today?
04/12/23, 2:13 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I was escorting my friend to the hospital. He hasn’t been feeling well since morning
04/12/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What happened, Dalitso? Is he alright?
04/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: He got medication and the doctor said he will be fine after 4 days, he has had a high fever since he woke up and he said he felt weak and had nausea. He was found with malaria.
04/12/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, and it's good to know how caring you are for your friends.
04/12/23, 2:28 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s the least I can do since they look out for me as well when I’m going through tough times
04/12/23, 2:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand, Before we proceed further, I'd love to get to know you better! Would you be willing to share a bit about yourself? Your hobbies, goals, and passions?
04/12/23, 2:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Of course, the things I enjoy the most are having quality time with my friends, going for walks to admire nature, sometimes I enjoy watching the stars at night. During my spare time alone I watch some documentaries and movies or read some articles. 

My primary goal is to achieve the highest degree I can possibly reach. My secondary goals include completing my bachelor’s degree with a distinction, learning two or three skills that are valued on the market and if all goes well realize my dream to travel around the world

My passions… that’s a bit tricky but if I were to select one I am really interested in then it would be art
04/12/23, 2:46 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's awesome! Your mix of interests is so diverse. Quality time with friends and nature walks sound so refreshing. Watching the stars is just magical, isn't it? 🌌 And your goals are ambitious – highest degree, distinction in bachelor's, skills, and world travel? That's the way to go!  

Also, art is fantastic. What kind of art are you drawn to? Painting, music, or something else? 🎨🎶 <This message was edited>
04/12/23, 2:51 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Thank you very much. 

I really like music poetry and drama. It’s mesmerizing how people can express so much emotion with a small amount of words and still be able to move the hearts of many people leaving different impacts on them. That’s where I see the beauty in art, everyone sees art differently and they translate it in the way they can relate to it and that is unique to everyone.
04/12/23, 4:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now, as we close today's session, let me leave you with a thought: 'The only way to do great work is to love what you do.' - Steve Jobs. Let this inspire us for tomorrow. Until then, take care, and let us connect tomorrow.🧠🏆
04/12/23, 4:23 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Will be looking forward to tomorrow as well
05/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good day 
Am ready if you are .
05/12/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso

Here's a fun and easy fact to brighten your day: Honeybees can recognize human faces! These tiny creatures have an amazing ability to remember and distinguish between different human faces. So, the next time you see a bee buzzing around, maybe it's just saying, "Hello!"🐝
05/12/23, 1:40 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s something amazing
05/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/12/23, 1:44 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Please explain them to me.
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
05/12/23, 1:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents pay off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/12/23, 1:57 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very much understandable
05/12/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure that will happen after we discuss all our projects in depth (not now), which will mandate us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s very interesting
05/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
05/12/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:12 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have finished and thank u for sharing
05/12/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
05/12/23, 2:20 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: On the EDOOFA HALL OF INSPIRATION it states that “ Time is an
important factor and it has to be managed well.” And “ As the road gets tougher you also get tougher “ 

I feel like these are life keys that one needs to live by
05/12/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Dalitso?
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That sounds great 👍
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
05/12/23, 2:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yeah it’s clear
05/12/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our session for today! Meanwhile, check out our new post on our Instagram page!

05/12/23, 2:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: That’s really a nice post 🔥
05/12/23, 3:15 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: I have gone through the PDF
06/12/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Dalitso!

Let us begin today's session with a quick riddle: 'I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. You can enter, but you can't go inside. What am I?'

Try to answer!😄
06/12/23, 1:37 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Good afternoon,, 

Am thinking of a keyboard, did I get that right?
06/12/23, 1:41 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, you are right!🚀✨
06/12/23, 1:42 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am Glad 🥳
06/12/23, 1:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Dalitso did you manage to read the document?
06/12/23, 1:51 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Yes I did, although I need a brief explanation on its details for a wider understanding
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Don't worry  I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/12/23, 1:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: Am done
06/12/23, 2:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
06/12/23, 2:11 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: The first project aims to make me understand the market am going to work in after graduation there as starting work on it at an early stage.

Due to the pandemic most companies have improved to online technology and the use of LinkedIn helps to connect with different managers of different companies
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Amazing, Dalitso. I’m happy with your understanding. 

So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
06/12/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/12/23, 2:27 pm - +265 992 60 60 54: It’s a guideline for how to search for the right companies and things to consider when doing so such as nature of the company and scale of the company as two of the examples mentioned 

And examples of platforms used in older to reach out to different companies and the steps to help one do so
06/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let us conclude our today's session here, and I can't wait to connect with you in our next session tomorrow!

Meanwhile, check out this incredible post on our page, and don't miss the comment section! 🥳
