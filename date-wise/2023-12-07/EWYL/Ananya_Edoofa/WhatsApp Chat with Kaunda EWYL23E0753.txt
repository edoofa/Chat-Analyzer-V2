11/10/23, 9:59 am - +260 97 7453492: This is Kaunda’s mother,I have been standing in for him throughout this process. He started it with Mr Shubham but now he has gone back to school,he is in a boarding school and he will be finishing his grade 12 exams next month.
11/10/23, 10:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @260977453492 

I understand the situation really well. I definitely want Kaunda to not compromise on his studies and give his best. Therefore, in order to prevent Kaunda from falling behind, you can attend the initial process with me and wait for his exams to finish.
11/10/23, 10:21 am - Ananya Edoofa: It is important to complete the initial process. In order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects.
11/10/23, 11:01 am - +260 97 7453492: Okay noted
11/10/23, 1:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Dear Kaunda,

Good afternoon. I trust you're doing well. In my ongoing efforts to enhance productivity and efficiency in preparation for your future education, I have devised a new timetable. This update includes a *change in the timing* of your EWYL sessions.

Starting today, our sessions are rescheduled to run from *1:30 PM to 2:30 PM.* I have faith that you'll be able to accommodate this new timing and join our sessions accordingly.
11/10/23, 1:44 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon
Okay I am available now.
11/10/23, 1:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
11/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7453492: Kindly go through them for me.
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
11/10/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
11/10/23, 2:01 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay that sounds good.
Well noted
11/10/23, 2:02 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
11/10/23, 2:03 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay done.
11/10/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
11/10/23, 2:07 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted.
11/10/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates *Kaunda* to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either *Monday/Thursday* or *Tuesday/Friday*. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
11/10/23, 2:11 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay well noted
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once *Kaunda* forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - +260 97 7453492: Done
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: -At this stage, I would like to share with you the three goals I have set for myself for *Kaunda*’S EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure *Kaunda* is given enough opportunities to self-finance higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that is learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare for the real-world workplace and grow holistically! <This message was edited>
11/10/23, 2:22 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let's wrap up today's session here. We'll reconvene tomorrow at the same time, 1:30 PM. Looking forward to seeing you there! ✨
11/10/23, 2:25 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay thank you and have a great day.
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,@260977453492 

Should we move forward with our discussion?
12/10/23, 1:32 pm - +260 97 7453492: Good afternoon,yes we can.
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work upon three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that *Kaunda* will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
12/10/23, 1:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:56 pm - +260 97 7453492: Done
12/10/23, 2:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how *Kaunda* can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give best in the projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things *Kaunda* is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully
12/10/23, 2:12 pm - +260 97 7453492: Well noted thank you
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Monday and Thursday - 9:30 am to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
12/10/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
12/10/23, 2:15 pm - +260 97 7453492: Okay well noted.
12/10/23, 2:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Thank you so much for taking out time to complete these discussions, I really appreciate it.

As per our Academic Board terms, you need to draft a mail to Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, and me stating that:
Greetings of the day,
I, <NAME>, from <SCHOOL> and Group name <EWYL GROUP NAME> won't be able to continue with my EWYL program till _ (date) because I am having my exams from _ to __ (date) and I will reach out to my mentor, Ms. Aditi as soon as I get over with my exams.

28/11/23, 8:51 am - +260 97 5991740: Noted ma'am
28/11/23, 8:51 am - Ananya Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
28/11/23, 8:54 am - +260 97 5991740: Ok ma'am
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/11/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/11/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, before we sign off, here's a quick one for you: Why don't scientists trust atoms?

Because they make up everything! 😄 Anyway, it was great chatting with you today. 

Let's catch up again tomorrow at the same time, 8:30 AM. Take care and see you soon!
28/11/23, 9:24 am - +260 97 5991740: Okay 😂😂 and thank you ma'am
29/11/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Kaunda!

As we embark on our session, here's another intriguing fact about India: The country is not only known for its diverse cultures but also for being home to the *world's highest cricket ground*. At an altitude of 2,444 meters, the Chail Cricket Ground in Himachal Pradesh provides a breathtaking setting for the sport. 🏏🏞️
29/11/23, 8:32 am - +260 97 5991740: Hey Ms Ananya. Interesting, I used to play cricket when I was younger.
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Really? Wow!
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
*It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
*While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains
29/11/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would like each one of you to take a look at the video that I am sharing below.

Please have a look at it and share your thoughts with me.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
