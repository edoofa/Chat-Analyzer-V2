12/08/23, 11:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: *Congratulations, our Proud Edoofian!*

You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

I believe this accomplishment calls for a dedicated session to delve deeper into the details. I would like to offer you the opportunity to have a focused discussion about the grant and its implications. Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

12/08/23, 12:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
16/08/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, my Proud Edoofian!

How are you today? Are you ready for your session?🌟
16/08/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 676 6337: I am ready
16/08/23, 3:26 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now let me start this session by telling you the importance of the Grant. So are you ready?
16/08/23, 3:30 pm - +263 71 676 6337: I am ready
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments
16/08/23, 3:31 pm - Ananya Edoofa: They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 676 6337: This is so encouraging
16/08/23, 3:33 pm - +263 71 676 6337: it motivates us as students to work even harder
16/08/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Are you aware of the reason behind being awarded this grant?
16/08/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Please tell me Ms Ananya
16/08/23, 3:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your consistent dedication, unwavering effort, and relentless hard work have truly set you apart. Among the numerous students who were considered, you have exemplified the qualities and met the criteria that make you a deserving winner of this challenge.
Your commitment to excellence and your ability to rise to the occasion have not gone unnoticed. You have proved your mettle, and it is now with great pride that we entrust you with this responsibility. The title you have earned is not just a recognition of your past achievements; it is also an acknowledgment of the potential and promise you hold for the future.
16/08/23, 3:48 pm - +263 71 676 6337: I really appreciate
16/08/23, 3:49 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Also, I want to emphasise that these grants are not boundaries but rather stepping stones for you to reach greater heights. I believe you have the potential to earn tenfold more than the grant amount by effectively and efficiently working on projects. While these grants signify your commitment and dedication, I am confident that you can surpass them. You have the capability to earn credits far exceeding the grant value and completely fund your education through your hard work and dedication. Keep aiming high!
16/08/23, 3:50 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Thank you Ms Ananya for your support and motivation
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I'm providing you with a comprehensive FAQ document that addresses all potential queries. It's advisable for both you and your parents to review it thoroughly. If any additional questions arise, please make a note of them so that we can address them in our future discussions.
16/08/23, 3:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/08/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted
16/08/23, 3:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I assume you've had the chance to review the Grant Letter. Now, I would really appreciate it if you and your parents proceed with signing the undertaking of the Grant Letter, which will serve as the formal acceptance of your grant.

Your well-earned achievement is a testament to your dedication, and I can imagine your parents must be filled with pride. It's worth noting that this victory extends beyond just yourself, your family shares in this accomplishment as well. With that in mind, I'd be interested to hear your Parents' sentiments as well regarding your grant win.
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted Ms Ananya
16/08/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As we wrap up our discussion, I wish to celebrate your extraordinary achievement. Among so many dedicated and hardworking students, it was your unbeatable determination and added skills that set you apart and earned you this prestigious grant. This is not just a mere stroke of luck, but a testament to your relentless pursuit of excellence🚀

I wholeheartedly urge you to channel your efforts diligently every single day and unburden yourself from financial concerns by earning as many scholarship credits as possible. 

I wish you all the very best for this new Grant journey!

What about the facebook review?
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!!

I hope this message finds you well. 
As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays* through *EWYL Group*. This chat-based format aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls* on *alternate Saturdays.* This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.
10/10/23, 12:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: For example, 
 *Week 1*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday 
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 11/10/2023

 *Week 2*: Call on Saturday
📅: 21/10/2023

 *Week 3*: Whatsapp session on Wednesday
📍EWYL Group
⏳07:00-07:45 PM
📅 25/10/2023 

 *Week 4*: Call on Saturday 
📅: 04/11/2023

I understand that as a mentor, I might have to go through the extra mile, but I want you to know that your progress is of utmost importance to me, and if you are willing to meet me midway,  I believe this new schedule will be more manageable for you and we can proceed with our journey of EWYL for you to become a successful professional!
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: _*Welcome to our first EWYL chat session*_

I am delighted to embark on this new journey of communication with you. To begin with, I would like to invite you to watch this incredible and relatable video:

I hope you're doing well. I've noticed that you haven't been joining your EWYL sessions and calls for the past three weeks. We only meet once a week for just an hour, and it's alarming that you have not been serious about your commitments. It is crucial that you attend if you appreciate the opportunities you've been given.

I understand that juggling everything can be tough, but remember, stepping out of your comfort zone is essential for your path to success. If you're struggling with time management or facing challenges, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. I'm here to support you; all you need to do is share your concerns.

09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings!

I want to inform you that I'll be away from *10th to 13th Nov*, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on *Tuesday* once the echoes of fireworks settle down. 

Wishing you a Diwali filled with laughter, love, and the sweet taste of festive treats. May the coming days be as colorful and bright as the festival itself! See you soon!✨
09/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

I hope this message finds you well. As we navigate through the academic year, I believe it's crucial for us to reflect on the values that drive our individual and collective growth. One such value that plays a significant role in our personal and academic development is the "Spirit of Competition."

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

30/11/23, 12:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Ropa, let us connect today at 6:00 PM to continue with our discussion.

30/11/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Yes Ms Ananya im ready
30/11/23, 2:39 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Before I get into the details of the grant and the process of its redemption, I would like to talk about the 21-day Grant challenge (or the moment when the Grant was allocated to you by the founders of Edoofa - Mr. Angad & Mr. Avreen Singh); that was conducted when you were back home. I trust that you recall participating in this challenge, where you were awarded a grant of $100 annually. 
Do you remember this?
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Yes l remember this
30/11/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Excellent Ropa, on the same lines, do you remember the guidelines that were mentioned in the Grant Letter? I hope you recall that to make the most of the grant money and redeem it, it was important to satisfy a few guidelines that were stated obediently and thoroughly. 
Can you recall what they were?
30/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Yes Ms  Ananya
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is a quick revision! 

1. You can redeem either the Edoofa Grant or the scholarship credits earned by you during the year, whichever is higher. You cannot redeem both amounts. 

2. You are required to maintain a minimum of 75% attendance in the respective university classes. 

3. The University fee is to be strictly paid within the timeline prescribed by the university. The Grant would only be disbursed to the University if the remaining fee (Total Fee for the semester minus Grant Amount) for that semester is cleared as per the deadline shared by the University.

4. A Minimum of 75% attendance in the Earn While You Learn Program during the year, including submission/participation rate in EWYL weekly activities/lessons, webinars, orientation & project submissions.
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
30/11/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
30/11/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
30/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Following
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
30/11/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To make it simple for you to understand - considering a total of 6 sessions have taken place with me (2 in September & 4 in October), 6 webinars (4 in September & 2 in October), and positive attendance in the orientation session that took place at your University, you currently stand at:

30/11/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted
30/11/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you calculate your attendance, do you think it's 75%?
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Noo it’s not
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Well,I can completely understand that you would have been occupied in University classes, assignments, and exams but let me highlight the story of our student Nicassio Simbarashe, who was given the grant opportunity and without compromising any call, any day, he worked on the projects with his utmost attention, attended all the webinars and session with his mentor without fail. For him, it was not an added responsibility, but he considered Edoofa and the time given by his mentor crucial for his personal and professional growth. Making him one of our top earners and best performers.
30/11/23, 3:05 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Following
30/11/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: My aim is not to compare you with any other student but to help build a benchmark for you that we have a big scope for improvement and to showcase our best performance.
30/11/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 676 6337: I really understand
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, I know how dedicated you are and personally, I don't want you to miss out on any opportunity, therefore, I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents
30/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 676 6337: True Ms Ananya
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that, I believe, if you do perform, as per the above, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can surely confirm that you will surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. There is no limit to how much you can earn via the scholarship credits and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits. In our aim to do so, let us break the process into steps by first setting a desirable goal that you can achieve in this timeline. The primary requirement for us to achieve the goal of earning more than the Grant amount is your regular connection with me as a mentor and your dedication to working on the project. I hope that you are ready to take on this challenge with me.

I would like you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.
30/11/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 676 6337: It is really a good plan
30/11/23, 3:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: What I believe is very simple, you have to be consistent in all the calls and EWYL Group sessions, and in these sessions only I will be sharing ideas that can help you to level up your performance in the project exponentially. Another thing that you have to keep in mind is attending all the webinars without fail because they teach us skills beyond the four walls of the classroom and it directly caters to the idea of you becoming job-ready.
30/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Well noted
30/11/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have full faith in you and you to realize that this opportunity is not yet lost. We can do our level best and seize the opportunity to self-finance ourselves. Just remember one thing, consistency and dedication are definitely the keys to excel and I believe that you have the potential to do it.
30/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 676 6337: Thank you Ms Ananya
30/11/23, 3:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Absolutely, I want to share fact with you that many of you are not realising, while the grant amount is limited, there's no cap on earning scholarship credits.
Recognizing your potential, I will help in personal training to help you to accumulate substantial scholarship credits. Although you're currently ineligible for the grant, with two months left—November and December—ensure your attendance at every session and webinar from this point onward.
