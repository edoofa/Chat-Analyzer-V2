I hope you are doing great! I wanted to let you know that I won't be able to connect today because I have some personal work that needs my urgent attention.

Meanwhile, I would recommend you to read the following document. Once you've gone through it, kindly send a practice email to yourself and cc me at ananyaa.edoofa@gmail.com before our next session.

Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect lately. Actually, we have initiated our orientation program in collaboration with our partner universities, which is why we were present at those institutions.
08/09/23, 8:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/09/23, 10:21 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am...that is okay i understand
09/09/23, 10:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings my Proud Edoofian!

Since schools are now open, and I don't want you to be diverted from your studies, I would like to ask about your schedule. This will help me plan our proceedings accordingly and ensure that we can stay connected even if you cannot attend your sessions.🤝🏽
09/09/23, 10:57 am - +263 78 465 0764: Góod morning ma'am. We end school leasons at 1600hrs. I will be free from then
11/09/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 851 5686: Okay ma'am I will let you know as soon as am done
12/09/23, 4:40 pm - +263 78 465 0764: Good evening ma'am. I have sent the emails
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:03 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 9:14 am - +263 77 294 3780: Morning how are you
15/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 77 294 3780: It's ok with me a parent... Tanatswa will respond soon
15/09/23, 12:20 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you please select your batch?
15/09/23, 12:21 pm - +263 78 465 0764: the first batch is suitable ma'am
15/09/23, 12:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, you know if you are available tomorrow at 8:30am, we can connect at that time as well.
15/09/23, 12:23 pm - +263 78 465 0764: i will be available ma'am
15/09/23, 12:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great! See you tomorrow.
16/09/23, 8:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Parents and Tanatswa!

How are you doing today?
16/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 465 0764: Good morning ma'am...am okay and how are you doing
16/09/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
16/09/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes i am ready for this journey to commence
16/09/23, 9:13 am - Ananya Edoofa: The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
16/09/23, 9:20 am - +263 78 465 0764: No ma'am.
16/09/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
16/09/23, 9:31 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
16/09/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 465 0764: I now understand the two key objectives of the EWYL team
16/09/23, 9:35 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
16/09/23, 9:36 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 9:38 am - +263 78 465 0764: I have read the email Mihlayonke wrote ma'am
16/09/23, 9:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
16/09/23, 9:39 am - +263 78 465 0764: That's wonderful....i understand
16/09/23, 9:39 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
16/09/23, 9:40 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates you to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
16/09/23, 9:41 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes it indeed sounds really interesting
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: - Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/09/23, 9:44 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Let us connect on *Monday from 8:30 am to 9:30 am*, to move forward with our sessions.
16/09/23, 9:53 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you...i have gone through the newsletter
18/09/23, 8:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 8:45 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
19/09/23, 5:59 pm - +263 78 465 0764: I apologise for my absence im today's session. My data bundle had depleted. I will read the document as asked. i once again apologise
20/09/23, 7:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanatswa!

Kindly submit your understaning before your session.
20/09/23, 8:27 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
20/09/23, 8:37 am - Ananya Edoofa: Are you ready for the session now?
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 465 0764: i understood that the EDOOFA program is aiming in enhancing work skills and competencies of individuals. It aims at preparing individuals of what they will learn later in the work life, encouraging social relations with businesses that will help in later work interactions of students. This is further beneficial for students because students earn scholarship credits helping in the payment of the part of the school fees lessening the financial burden on parents
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 78 465 0764: This is my understanding ma'am
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great!  Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
20/09/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 465 0764: Yes ma'am. We are on the same page
21/09/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, 

How are you? Are you ready for your session?✨
21/09/23, 9:10 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
21/09/23, 9:10 am - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
21/09/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
21/09/23, 9:17 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am
21/09/23, 9:20 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now, we have finally reached the end. I am extremely happy that you took out time to understand how Tanatswa’s involvement in the EWYL program can bring her closer to reaching her career goals.

I would appreciate it if you discuss the understanding of all the sessions with her and explain the importance of discipline & consistency in the EWYL Journey.
21/09/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am...after her reply?
21/09/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: This message was deleted
21/09/23, 9:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Which reply? @263784650764
21/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 78 465 0764: I sent her this message

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am Tanatswa Masterl and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is Tanatswa EWYL23E0560
21/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 465 0764: Do I share my understanding of the EWYL program only after she replies to the above message or I may proceed in sharing my understanding regardless
21/09/23, 9:32 am - Ananya Edoofa: May I ask if you wish to move forward with the sessions or you want to continue once your exams are over?
21/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 78 465 0764: I would prefer to continue after my exams are over
21/09/23, 9:34 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright then! All the best for your exams.✨
21/09/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 465 0764: Thank you very much
21/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 465 0764: Do I still regularly send the message saying "I am a proud EDOOFIAN" to Ms Ananya
21/09/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 465 0764: or I only send after my exams end
21/09/23, 9:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: After your exams.
21/09/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 465 0764: yes ma'am...Thank you once again
19/10/23, 8:43 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I understand that you're currently dealing with exams, but I've shared a video with you to support your studies. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your progress and want to see you succeed in your examinations.

I must admit that I'm quite disappointed that there hasn't been a response from you. Communication is essential for us to work together effectively. If you have any concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to share them with me. Let's ensure we're on the same page and working toward your success.
30/10/23, 4:42 pm - +263 77 294 3780: how are you sir...sorry for not updating...Tanatswa had some problems with her for its not working properly...but she can get intouch here and there.

30/10/23, 4:43 pm - +263 77 294 3780: with her phone***
31/10/23, 7:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tanatswa and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:22 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.
07/11/23, 6:57 pm - +263 77 294 3780: we are very fine thank you..good to hear from you
07/11/23, 6:59 pm - +263 77 294 3780: There are a few key factors that can help someone succeed in an earn while you learn  journey. First, it is important to have a clear goal in mind for what you want to achieve through the program. Second, it is important to have a good work ethic and be willing to put in the necessary effort to succeed. Third, it is important to be willing to learn new skills and take on new challenges. Fourth, it is important to build a good relationship with your employer or training provider. Fifth,it is important to have good communication skills and be able to work well with others etc...
17/11/23, 4:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Tanatswa!
Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔.

Let us begin our session with a *FUN FACT*: 

Did you know that the Basenji dog breed is known as the *"barkless dog"* because it doesn't bark like other dogs? Instead, it makes a unique yodel-like sound known as a *"barroo,"* due to the shape of its larynx. <This message was edited>

Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is that clear?
