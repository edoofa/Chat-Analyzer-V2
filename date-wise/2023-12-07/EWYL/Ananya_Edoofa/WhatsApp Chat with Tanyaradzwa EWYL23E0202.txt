How are you today? Kindly excuse me for the delay. I want to assure you that I completely understand your concern. However, today, our first batch of 2023 intake students arrived, and I was occupied with welcoming and settling them in.
01/08/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 2:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 3:09 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are doing well. You know, many of my students' winter break will be commencing from Friday, which is tomorrow, and they are all set to resume their EWYL journey and take a step towards their future education without wasting a single day of their holidays!

So, I wanted to ask if your winter break has started or not? When would you be able to resume your EWYL journey?
03/08/23, 4:31 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Greetings ma'am
Now we are on vacation so we are still at school and we will have a 2 week break and resume again
03/08/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 705 3454: All of my exams will be over by 18 November this year
04/08/23, 7:55 am - Ananya Edoofa: We can resume during your winter break, Tanyaradzwa! In that period, I will explain the projects so that you can work on them simultaneously!
04/08/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 705 3454: Ok ma'am
04/08/23, 8:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: So may I ask if you are ready to resume your journey?
04/08/23, 8:35 am - +263 78 705 3454: Yes l'm ready
But I might be affected by lessons here and as we are still at school on vacation
04/08/23, 8:38 am - Ananya Edoofa: And by when would you be able to finish with your exams?
04/08/23, 11:51 am - +263 78 705 3454: By 18 November all of my exams will be over
16/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Greetings ma'am
16/08/23, 2:34 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Our winter break begins tomorrow and it has a two week period and l will be ready to resume the journey as l will be free during those 2 weeks
16/08/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's amazing! Let us connect tomorrow. Kindly drop a message at 2:00 PM tomorrow!
16/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Ok ma'am l will do so
17/08/23, 3:10 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Afternoon ma'am
Sorry for being late
18/08/23, 8:09 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Tanyaradzwa!

That is alright, I understand. We cam connect today at 2:00PM
18/08/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 705 3454: It's great to know that
18/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
18/08/23, 2:18 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/08/23, 2:26 pm - +263 78 705 3454: I have gone through it
18/08/23, 2:33 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
18/08/23, 2:35 pm - +263 78 705 3454: All the parts of the newsletter were actually good but l actually favoured the part which was saying that "Teachers can open the doors ,but you must enter it yourself"
18/08/23, 2:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
18/08/23, 2:38 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Yes ma'am it's really something great
18/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
18/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*

15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning Parents and Students!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on 
*Saturdays at 8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:26 am - +263 78 705 3454: Sorry ma'am for not responding

16/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 705 3454: I can attend the sessions on my own but ma'am the time you have gave is difficult for me to attend
16/09/23, 9:29 am - +263 78 705 3454: What if it you schedule it from 10-11 or 11-12am because I will be free those times on Saturday
16/09/23, 9:30 am - Ananya Edoofa: Well, since your exams are important to us. Let us fast-track your process for now so that once you are done with your exams, we can proceed with full dedication. Is that alright?
16/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 705 3454: Yes it's alright thank you ma'am
16/09/23, 9:33 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great! Now I hope you have gone through the document that has all the information about the three projects, am I right?
16/09/23, 1:30 pm - +263 78 705 3454: Yes ma'am
16/09/23, 1:32 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Tanyaradzwa, I was waiting for your reply.

16/09/23, 1:35 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, can you ask your parents for that?

16/09/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 705 3454: I will ask them but l'm not sure if they will be able to be online because they are always on duty
16/09/23, 1:37 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. You can discuss this with them, it can be done in 1 hour only.

Are you ready for your session?✨
20/10/23, 9:23 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, @263787053454 

Our records show that you have not attended sessions for more than 30 days now. This message serves as an *official notice* from the academic board that prolonged absence from the program may result in the *revocation* of your child's participation in the EWYL program. I sincerely hope to avoid such a situation.

If you are facing any challenges or if any concerns have led to this absence, I urge you to share it with me so that we can have a conversation about it and provide the necessary support.
