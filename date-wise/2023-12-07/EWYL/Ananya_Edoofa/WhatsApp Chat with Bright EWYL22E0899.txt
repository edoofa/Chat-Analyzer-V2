You have won the *Grant challenge*! Your dedication, hard work, and innovative thinking have truly paid off, and I couldn't be happier for you.🌟

Let's set up a session on *Wednesday 16th of August at 3:00 PM CAT AND 6:30 PM Indian Time.* to go over everything in more detail.

To prepare for our discussion, I have attached a copy of the *grant letter* for your review. It outlines the terms and conditions of the grant, and having a solid understanding of its contents will allow us to have a productive conversation.

Please take some time to read through the grant letter before our session so that we can address any questions or concerns you may have. During our meeting, we can explore the next steps, expectations, and how this grant aligns with your broader goals.🚀

That's completely fine Bright! What happened? Are you alright now?
12/10/23, 1:23 pm - +91 79737 30374: I went through the video. It is highlighting the best way to study and understanding. 
1 . Small intervals of study, professor says that the best, healthy time to study is 30 minutes and you can take a minimum 5 minutes for break  which can give brain time to rest. In that 5 minutes you must do something that can refresh your mind.
2, Place of study; a person can designate a suitable position for studying where your body can adopt for just reading not any other thing.
3, Memorising; it's a good idea to memorize what you have red it will be in practical  and it will never come out of your mind
4, Don't skip sleep; to think well a person must have enough sleeps so as to accommodate fresh mind.
 Therefore a best study requires a good health and environment.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

As part of your Saturday activity, you are required to share your understanding of the Spirit of Competition. What does it mean to you? How has it influenced your approach to challenges and goals? 

Additionally, I encourage you to accompany your thoughts with a real-life example where your Spirit of Competition played a pivotal role in achieving success. Whether it's an academic accomplishment, a personal goal, or an extracurricular pursuit.

30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've been your mentor for the past few months, and it's been a pleasure watching your progress every week since your arrival in India. I've been keeping tabs on your weekly calls, sessions, and webinars, making sure you're staying on top of the tasks I've assigned, like submitting reviews, attending the orientation, and testimonial videos, etc. It's all part of making sure you make the most out of this fantastic opportunity.
30/11/23, 2:45 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The students who are doing well are the ones who consistently attend these sessions, basically, those who stay in touch with their mentors regularly. *And, remember, these are the only students who would be on the winning side of this opportunity this semester!*
30/11/23, 2:46 pm - +91 79737 30374: Following
30/11/23, 2:47 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let’s get the ball rolling, I actually wanted to draw comparisons on where you currently stand in terms of attending your sessions regularly and showing up on various activities that our Edoofians are supposed to perform in order to avail the benefits of the Grant, however, that being said, it is essential that you understand of the core belief behind the grant - to perform on the projects and earn as many scholarship credits as possible.
30/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 79737 30374: Following
30/11/23, 2:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: As you must be aware you are expected to attend all the sessions, webinars, and physical orientation sessions that take place, the eligibility criteria for all of them is merely 75% as per your grant letter.
30/11/23, 2:52 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 2:53 pm - +91 79737 30374: Understand
30/11/23, 2:54 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Can you calculate your attendance, do you think it's 75%?
30/11/23, 2:57 pm - +91 79737 30374: No it's 66%
30/11/23, 2:59 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Moreover, By the end of this semester, that is December, there will be a total of 12 mentor-based sessions and 10 webinars, hence, it is crucial that you mindfully attend all the reserved activities that we have set up for your benefit and attend them regularly and work on the projects with my training in place, I am 100% sure that you will surpass the Grant amount that is allocated to you and earn more scholarship credits as there is no limit to the total number of credits that you can earn. That is my priority for you in the next 45 days.
30/11/23, 3:02 pm - +91 79737 30374: I understand ma'am and I will do my best
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, considering your recent performance, I would like to ask you, are you willing to work with me on the projects constantly, every day for the next 45 days as I envision a journey that can craft a future that brings pride and joy to both you and your parents and help you pay the next semester’s fee!
I hope that you are ready and excited.
30/11/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I have planned the best way by which you can perform well and make the most of this opportunity. Remember again, our objective will always be with us to _self-finance our studies and reduce the financial burden from our parents_
30/11/23, 3:09 pm - +91 79737 30374: I am willing ma'am and I will be on place
30/11/23, 3:10 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/11/23, 3:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, this is a performance table that I believe if you do perform as per this, then I might not be able to assure you about your eligibility for a grant but I can confirm that if this performance goes then you can surely fulfill your objective of self-financing your fees partially. But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.

I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.

EWYL is an initiative  that allows students to gain Scholarship as a way to help reduce their cost if Education. 

One of the most enlightenment project i did isCommunity Building. It involves enlightening and finding potential students who are willing to study in india through various techniques like meeting school heads, social media and also physical meeting with the peers.
It involves telling students or parents the enrollment and eligibility processes of being an Edoofian.  During this course i managed to conduct it and i faced challenges of some students doubting the organisation and i learnt to provide maximum possible information to deliver to them about the program like giving them social media handles like FB and IG so that they can navigate and see some proud students acquiring their quality education abroad.

I use my experience as proof viability of Edoofa program 

I hope in January I'm going to have many students for that's time of receiving their a level results
05/12/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good evening, Bright! 🌆

Our whole team observed a sense of confusion among our students regarding Wednesday sessions and Saturday calls. These two confusing days were causing difficulty for our students to organize their week.

Therefore, after considering all available options, we have concluded a new timetable for you. *Starting tomorrow, we will only connect on Wednesdays every week.* One week it will be an EWYL group session, and the next week it will be a call.

📅 Wednesday, 6th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 13th December:
*Group Call*

📅 Wednesday, 19th December:
*EWYL group session at 6:00 PM*

📅 Wednesday, 29th December:
*Group Call*

As your mentor, I am ready to take a step ahead by considering and respecting your time and schedule. I expect you to reciprocate the same and attend the calls. Remember, you are here for your education and financing it on your own, so let's work together in that direction. I hope to see you tomorrow on time! ⏰ <This message was edited>
