16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings Parents and Blessing!

I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
16/09/23, 9:24 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am
OR
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
8:30 am to 9:30 am

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
16/09/23, 9:33 am - +263 77 599 2273: Morning. As Blessing's parent i am prepared for the sessions.
16/09/23, 9:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: May I know the timings that you would opt for?
16/09/23, 9:52 am - +263 77 599 2273: 8.30am to 9.30am
16/09/23, 10:42 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, you would be opting for a session on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am.
16/09/23, 11:27 am - +263 77 599 2273: Sure
16/09/23, 12:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great, then.

20/09/23, 8:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning.
I hope you are doing really well.

 So, are you ready to start our session?
20/09/23, 8:33 am - +263 77 599 2273: Morning yes I am ready
20/09/23, 8:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be Blessing's mentor. Before connecting today, I was given the responsibility for Blessing's application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about from her counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of  her application, particularly her desire to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of collective growth has always been my interest.
20/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263775992273 I am waiting for your response on this.
20/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 77 599 2273: Yes Blessing she is willing to study abroad
20/09/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
20/09/23, 9:33 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/09/23, 9:37 am - +263 77 599 2273: I am aware of Earn while you learn but I am not sure about its team objectives.
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that NAME is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals.
20/09/23, 9:37 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
20/09/23, 9:43 am - +263 77 599 2273: Noted
20/09/23, 9:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke, one of our students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
20/09/23, 9:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/09/23, 9:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: @263775992273 I hope that you have gone through it, and I would request you to please be responsive as it's about Blessing's EWYL Journey's base.
20/09/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 599 2273: Waal impressive
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/09/23, 9:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.

20/09/23, 10:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates NAME to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
20/09/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 599 2273: Following
20/09/23, 10:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.

1. Give best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss EWYL sessions without informing the mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share challenges and the things Blessing is good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make mentor trust the student fully

25/09/23, 8:39 am - Aditi Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. Once Blessing is back, she is supposed to note a few things.

Either you can make the decision on her behalf, or she can be active for a few minutes in the session and let us know what timetable would be most suited to proceed with once she is back from school.
25/09/23, 8:45 am - +263 77 599 2273: Blessing for now she can not be active because she doesn't have phone at school so as from 15th of November she will be able to participate in the sessions as for Time I suggest this morning session will be ok.
25/09/23, 8:46 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright.

25/09/23, 8:57 am - Aditi Edoofa: Moving towards the end, I wanted to take a few minutes to explain to you the different stages that Blessing has crossed in the complete journey of  being an Edoofian
To have a clear understanding of the Edoofa program and the various points of contact that will be there. I would like to brief you about the roles of Counselor, Admission Officer, and EWYL Mentor.
25/09/23, 8:58 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *counselor* is the first point of contact_ and has been guiding during the _onboarding process_ where she learned about the Edoofa program and the prerequisites to be a part of the same. 
After that, she was contacted by the_Admissions Officer_. I hope you are in contact with the admissions officer, so by now, you must be aware that all the admissions-related queries like _VISA process, Registration fees, AAL, etc. would be addressed/handled by the Admissions Team._
25/09/23, 8:59 am - Aditi Edoofa: Finally, she will be starting the_EWYL journey with EWYL Mentor,_ where one gets the chance to learn *21st-century job skills* and *earn scholarship credits* which will ultimately help Blessing fund your higher education.

The mentor will be the closest point of contact who will help to build Blessing's personality along with a diversified skill set. All queries related to EWYL program will be addressed by the mentor.
