06/10/23, 2:18 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So Blessing, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
06/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes ma'am I got your Ideas and I will be also happy with EWYL journey
06/10/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
06/10/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 627 6510: When I finish my course l would to upgrade myself to the highest level and get a very good earning job so that l will help my family and other relatives of concern. And l hope EWYL will help me to reduce my academic cost
06/10/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic aspiration, and it's wonderful that you're thinking not only about your own personal growth but also about how you can make a positive impact on your family and relatives. Pursuing further education and seeking a higher-earning job is a great way to achieve these goals.
06/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Thank you ma'am
06/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
06/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 627 6510: No l don't have any idea
06/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
06/10/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
06/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's fantastic ma'am
06/10/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok l understood.. this is great
06/10/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
06/10/23, 3:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
06/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Wonderful
06/10/23, 3:09 pm - +263 71 627 6510: It's ok ma'am
06/10/23, 3:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
06/10/23, 3:13 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes ma'am it's great
06/10/23, 3:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session concludes here. 
Please note that there are no sessions scheduled for Saturday and Sunday.
 Our next session will take place on Monday. 
I wish you a wonderful weekend ahead!🌺
06/10/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Thank you..same to you
09/10/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 627 6510: Hello Ms Aditi . I think we should schedule all of our sessions at 17:00pm to 18:00pm because during the day l will be busy with my school work. And also my final examinations are near , so I will need enough time  to prepare for my examinations .
09/10/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 627 6510: <Media omitted>
09/10/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
I hope that you are in excellent condition!
09/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 307 6908: Greetings Ms Aditi how are you over there
09/10/23, 2:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am well. Thanks for asking
09/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'd appreciate if you would share the school's schedule to help me adjust the timings, as the current schedule falls outside my working hours and is difficult for me to accommodate.
09/10/23, 5:39 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok ma'am no problem, so let's  schedule our sessions at 1:00pm during the lunch time
10/10/23, 1:49 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok ma'am no problem.
10/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 71 627 6510: We can start now I am available
10/10/23, 2:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, great!
10/10/23, 2:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Resuming our discussion from here, there is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
10/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok ma'am
10/10/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's wonderful news
10/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Fantastic news
10/10/23, 2:29 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
10/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Wonderful to hear that
10/10/23, 2:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Blessing?
10/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 77 390 2274: Wonderful
10/10/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.

*Are you ready for the questions?*
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Powerful
10/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes ma'am

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?

10/10/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's wonderful
10/10/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes ma'am
10/10/23, 2:44 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Blessing please answer these questions.
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 627 6510: 1. My EWYL mentor is Ms Aditi . Also we have Ms Sanjana the head of the department and also we have Ms Davi the head coach.
2. To make sure that my academic journey is great. Also to ensure opportunities to self finance in my higher education and also for me to learn and involve with the relevance 21st-century skills to prepare me for the real world.
3. Newsletter 
4. It is about learning to interact with other people being away of the social issues and learning to amend deformities present in our society.
10/10/23, 2:54 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes I am done
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Fantastic!
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We’re ready to begin your EWYL program now, and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects you can and will be a part of. Once you’ve gone through it thoroughly- we can discuss your understanding and then help you get started with the projects! Is it clear?
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
10/10/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Thank you
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted ma'am
10/10/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: After you go through this I want you to share your understanding of the document with me. I just want to ensure we don’t miss anything!
10/10/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 627 6510: It's ok ma'am
10/10/23, 3:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. It was a fantastic session, and I'm looking forward to our next session.
10/10/23, 3:28 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok ma'am
11/10/23, 12:02 pm - +263 71 627 6510: I understood that these projects will help me to socialise  with the community and help to spread Edofa programme
11/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 71 627 6510: This document helps to learn new age skills which will me become employable and also help me ear scholarship credits which will lower educational expenses and enhances our family savings
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Hello!
How are you?

So, are you prepared for today's session?
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes please I'm  ready
11/10/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct!
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Afternoon
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/10/23, 2:20 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Yes I have listened
11/10/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly-can you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/10/23, 8:26 pm - +263 71 627 6510: I understood that the nature of the potential company must be either student-centric that is there are career development platforms within the business. Also the scale of the potential company should not be either too big or too small, the company's financial stability must be financially sound and also l should also check the background of the founder of the selected company in terms of experiences and qualifications. I can find this information through platforms like Google, LinkedIn and other social media platforms . (Facebook, Instagram or Twitter).
12/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That is correct!
12/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.
12/10/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 1-  I’m sharing a form with you below, you can share that with the students whom you speak with and think that they truly deserve to be an Edoofian and fulfill their dreams of higher education!

12/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - +263 71 627 6510: That's good
12/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
12/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*BLESSING/ADITI/12OCT23*
12/10/23, 2:52 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
12/10/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

12/10/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ok ma'am
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
12/10/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
12/10/23, 3:03 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It was lovely having this session with you, and I am looking forward to connecting with you tomorrow.

17/10/23, 2:40 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Ma'am you know what during this period of examinations. The headmasters will be busy with the examinations so it's not easy to get in touch with them and also l don't think the school headmaster will agree with this issue to conduct him .

18/10/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 627 6510: Noted
18/10/23, 2:13 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
