25/09/23, 8:40 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Panashe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
25/09/23, 8:44 am - +263 71 323 8283: My long term goal is becoming an artificial intelligence and to create a unique name world wide that l can be remembered with . L think the EWYL can help by providing me with the support that is needed in completing my masters and also sharing ideas with me on how l can perform
25/09/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: That's a fantastic long-term goal! Becoming an expert in artificial intelligence and making a name for yourself worldwide is an ambitious and admirable aspiration. It's great that you see EWYL as a valuable resource to help you achieve your dreams. 
Remember to stay dedicated, keep learning, and continuously work on your skills and ideas.
25/09/23, 8:46 am - +263 71 323 8283: Thank you
25/09/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
25/09/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes
25/09/23, 8:50 am - Aditi Edoofa: So would you like to brief me about your understanding of it?
25/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 71 323 8283: One of the them is to make sure that each child understands of there dream and goal so that you are able to help them in achieving there goals 

The other one is to ensure that students are given projects which they can use to earn credit points
25/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great, let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
25/09/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
25/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky
25/09/23, 8:56 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky noted
25/09/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
25/09/23, 9:01 am - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts. <This message was edited>
25/09/23, 9:13 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky it is a pleasure to be interacting with you all  good to know you Ms.Sunjana and Ms.Davi
25/09/23, 9:13 am - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
25/09/23, 9:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
25/09/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes really interesting
25/09/23, 9:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.
25/09/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 9:23 am - +263 71 323 8283: L was able to go through them
25/09/23, 9:23 am - Aditi Edoofa: So may I know which section from the newsletter you *liked the most*, personally for me, it is very difficult to tell, each section has its taste and interest.
25/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes it's really difficult to tell which one is the best section as they all teaches with different perspectives but l think the quotes did there best to me
25/09/23, 9:26 am - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
25/09/23, 9:27 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes l read it and it was also one inspiring section
25/09/23, 9:28 am - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Panashe?
25/09/23, 9:30 am - +263 71 323 8283: It's sounds amazing and that is so thoughtful of you
25/09/23, 9:31 am - Aditi Edoofa: I'm delighted to hear that you're excited about the opportunity, and your words mean a lot to me as your mentor.
25/09/23, 9:32 am - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
*Are you ready for the questions?*
25/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 323 8283: Sure thing
25/09/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes
25/09/23, 9:34 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

4. Explain in your own words what the Hall of Inspiration is.

03/10/23, 9:09 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky sure thank you
03/10/23, 9:10 am - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
03/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky l understand
03/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 71 323 8283: So are you going to tell me when to start my projects
03/10/23, 9:12 am - Aditi Edoofa: You can start working on them right away if you wish to.

03/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky sounds interesting
03/10/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, noted!
03/10/23, 9:15 am - Aditi Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*PANASHE/ADITI/3rdOCT23*
03/10/23, 9:15 am - +263 71 323 8283: Better
03/10/23, 9:16 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky oky
03/10/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
03/10/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
03/10/23, 9:17 am - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

03/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky noted and understood
03/10/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
03/10/23, 9:20 am - +263 71 323 8283: So am l allowed to even use a form 5 group
03/10/23, 9:20 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍
 
Edoofa receives applications from _South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries_. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 2100 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just *affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven* so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains

05/10/23, 8:48 am - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, TODAY, I would like you to connect with your School Head. I will be guiding you at every point in this process. Our main aim through this will be to bring the privilege that Edoofa provides to all your schoolmates.

May I know if you have the Whatsapp contact of the School Head whom you want us to reach out to? And if not I would suggest you find it today so that we can move ahead soon.

09/10/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Superb!
09/10/23, 8:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Now, we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
09/10/23, 8:40 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky sure
09/10/23, 8:42 am - +263 71 323 8283: L think so far so good l understood it all
09/10/23, 8:43 am - Aditi Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.

However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!

*So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
09/10/23, 8:45 am - +263 71 323 8283: Yes am very much excited
09/10/23, 8:45 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
09/10/23, 8:47 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky oky
09/10/23, 8:47 am - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
09/10/23, 8:49 am - +263 71 323 8283: What does SEO stands for and am sure would like to know more on influencer marketing
09/10/23, 8:51 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, sure I will help you with that so basically:

*SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.
09/10/23, 8:54 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky l understand and what about blog writing
09/10/23, 8:54 am - Aditi Edoofa: So Panashe, *Blog writing* - Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
09/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky thank you on that one
09/10/23, 9:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency

09/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 323 8283: Noted
09/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 323 8283: Oky
09/10/23, 9:33 am - +263 71 323 8283: Ok

09/10/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: You look lovely!
09/10/23, 9:35 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Panashe.
We will discuss on it.
09/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: It serves as a link between every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that most of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
09/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: Your session is on Monday and Thursday from 09:30-11:00 AM. In your session, you are required to:

▪️Active participation in most of the sessions by being punctual and actively engaging in the discussions
▪️Follow the daily ritual of saying 'I am a proud Edoofian' on the EWYL Line every day, every morning before 12 PM.
▪️Share your lesson and activity response before your session commences
▪️Sharing project updates
09/10/23, 9:36 am - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
09/10/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 323 8283: Thank you Ms.Aditi
