I am *Ms. Aditi* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.
29/09/23, 10:03 am - +263 77 494 6012: I'm so marvelled to know you ma'am
29/09/23, 10:03 am - Aditi Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well and I want to make sure that you make the most out of this program and learn new skills and earn scholarship credits.

03/10/23, 9:38 am - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, I'm deeply disappointed that you missed our scheduled session today without any prior notice. I trust that you recognize the importance of these sessions and the necessity of maintaining regular attendance.
03/10/23, 10:21 am - +263 77 494 6012: Good morning Ms Aditi. I would like to apologize for the inconveniences caused. Sorry I didn't not inform you that I was going to attend a lesson at school  at 8am this morning
03/10/23, 11:09 am - Aditi Edoofa: Okay, Israel, so may I please know your schools's schedule I want to make sure that you don't miss out on any opportunity.
03/10/23, 11:15 am - +263 77 494 6012: We attended lessons from Monday to Friday  at 8am upto 5pm <This message was edited>
03/10/23, 1:09 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Alright, Israel.
03/10/23, 1:10 pm - Aditi Edoofa: This message was deleted
03/10/23, 1:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose a slot.
*Monday to Friday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday to Friday: 2:00 pm to 3:00 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
03/10/23, 4:40 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Saturday will be ok. I'll be available

20/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: It's alright!
20/10/23, 2:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
20/10/23, 2:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes ma'am
20/10/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Good afternoon Ms Aditi
20/10/23, 2:34 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, I am waiting for a response on this.
20/10/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 494 6012: No ma'am would you please explain further
20/10/23, 2:40 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Sure!
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
20/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
20/10/23, 2:44 pm - +263 77 570 1107: No can you explain further
20/10/23, 2:45 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I have explained it. Please go through it.
20/10/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Wow this is nice. So I as a student what is it that I have to do inorder to get payed
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: That would be discussed in our further discussions.
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
20/10/23, 2:50 pm - Aditi Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
20/10/23, 2:53 pm - +263 77 494 6012: It's a pleasure to know you Ms Davi and Ms Sanjana
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: They are also honored to have you.
20/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
20/10/23, 3:05 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, we're wrapping up our session. There were some crucial discussions we couldn't cover; I encourage your active participation and respond timely because I believe you understand the significance of the EWYL session.
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Totally! That's awesome.
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I understand. Thank you ma'am.

28/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 502 6369: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 2:29 pm - +91 74284 45625: Greetings! I'm Ms. Sanjana, Head of Department, EWYL, and I hope this message finds you and your parents in good health.

I'm reaching out to let you know that your mentor, Ms. Aditi is experiencing some technical issues with her device. We are working to resolve this as soon as possible. In the meantime, to ensure you don't miss any important updates, Ms. Aditi will be using my device to convey the necessary information. 

Thank you for your understanding.
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Noted thank you for communicating
01/11/23, 2:48 pm - +91 74284 45625: Hye Israel, Ms. Aditi this side.
I hope you are ready for your session.
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes i am ready
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 570 1107: How are you Maam
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 74284 45625: I am well.
Thanks for asking.
01/11/23, 2:49 pm - +91 74284 45625: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

01/11/23, 3:07 pm - +91 74284 45625: - Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 570 1107: Yes that wld be great. I also think it will be great if Israel answers these questions. I am his sister
01/11/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 570 1107: He has gone for a discussion preparing for tomorrow’s exam
01/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 74284 45625: Okay, I understand! @263775701107
01/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 74284 45625: Thank you for informing me.

Please note that there won't be a session tomorrow because I'll be visiting one of our partner universities for the orientation program.

06/11/23, 5:10 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Yes maam
07/11/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So are you ready to begin today's session?⚡
07/11/23, 4:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm quite let down that you didn't attend our planned session today, and there wasn't any advance notice
07/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Good evening ma'am. Apologies, I went for a discussion without notifying you. But in our next session I won't miss out.

Hope you are well.
08/11/23, 8:14 am - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Israel you must take care of this from next time.
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So I hope you are ready for the session!💯
08/11/23, 4:27 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'm expressing profound disappointment over your absence from our planned session today
08/11/23, 7:29 pm - +263 77 494 6012: I apologize for missing your lesson again without notifying you in advance. We were called at school at 10am. I'm sorry ma'am and I take full responsibility for my mistake.

I am very sorry for wasting your time and disrupting your session plan. I know how much effort you put into preparing and delivering your lessons, and I appreciate your dedication and expertise. You are a great mentor and I learn so much from you.

The reason I missed your lesson was that I was needed at school to complile my computer sciences project that required my immediate attention. I was so overwhelmed and distracted that I forgot to inform you. This was very unprofessional and disrespectful of me, and I deeply regret it.

To make up for the missed session, I would like to ask you if we can reschedule it to Saturday again . I am also willing to do any extra work that you may assign me to catch up on the material. I promise that this will not happen again and that I will always notify you in advance if I have any issues that may affect our lessons.

Please accept my sincere apology and let me know how I can make this right. I value your mentorship and I hope to continue working with you and learning from you.
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Greetings!
Hope you are well,
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I understand, Israel.
09/11/23, 1:32 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I hope you are excited for today's session💯
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to let you know that we will be taking a vacation from November 10 to November 13 in honor of Diwali, a significant Indian festival.🪔
 We will reconvene on November 14 and in the interim, I would want to provide you with a Diwali Activity. You must learn about Diwali, light a candle on the occasion, and send me a photo of yourself celebrating it; I can't wait to see it!🤩
09/11/23, 6:18 pm - +263 77 494 6012: 😂😂 how is it done.
14/11/23, 8:16 am - Aditi Edoofa: Good Morning Israel!
Hope you are well.
14/11/23, 8:18 am - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, so I expect you to go through some articles regarding Diwali!
14/11/23, 11:02 am - +263 77 494 6012: Good morning ma'am. Yah I did some research and in summary I found out that Diwali is a Hindus festival of lights where we celebrate spiritual victory of light over darkness and good over evil. Just to mention a few, Diwali is a five day long festival and people refrain from eating meat. During Diwali, people typically wear their finest clothes, decorate their homes with earthen lamps and rangoli (decorative patterns made of colored rice flour), and worship Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity. There are also fireworks and family feasts, where sweets and gifts are shared.
14/11/23, 11:03 am - +263 77 494 6012: That's what I learnt maybe you can add or correct where I went wrong
14/11/23, 12:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Your research succinctly captures the essence of Diwali as a Hindu festival of lights, symbolizing the spiritual triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. Lasting five days, it involves abstaining from meat, wearing festive attire, decorating homes with lamps and rangoli, and worshiping Lakshmi for prosperity. Diwali is marked by fireworks, family feasts, and the sharing of sweets and gifts. 😊🕯️🎉
14/11/23, 1:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Are you ready for the session?🤩
14/11/23, 3:03 pm - +263 77 502 6369: Let's do in the next 1 hr 15mins

14/11/23, 4:12 pm - Aditi Edoofa: @263774946012 I would appreciate it if you would adhere to the time allotted to you.
14/11/23, 4:53 pm - +263 77 494 6012: Ok ma'am

27/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Am ready !
27/11/23, 2:04 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great!
27/11/23, 2:06 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Israel, may I know what you have retained till now regarding EWYL Projects, so that we can resume from there.
27/11/23, 2:13 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay .....we haven't talk much ...we last talked about the two main objectives of the EWYL
27/11/23, 2:14 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
27/11/23, 2:16 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Okay ma'am
27/11/23, 2:17 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
27/11/23, 2:18 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Interesting!!
27/11/23, 2:19 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 10 minutes should be enough.

27/11/23, 2:35 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Did you notice the _Edoofa Hall of Inspiration_? I am sure you would one day want yourself to be celebrated in this section, the entire Student community reads this newsletter and it's a great deal to be mentioned by the founder himself, isn't it?
27/11/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Yes ma'am
27/11/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for your EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound?
27/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 904 6919: Sounds great ma'am
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from our discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
27/11/23, 2:43 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are the questions, answer them in detail:

1. Share a small introduction of everyone on your  EWYL team.
2. What goals has your mentor set for your EWYL journey?
3. How does Mr. Angad Singh, founder of Edoofa, interact with all students?
A. Newsletter       B. Youtube

27/11/23, 2:53 pm - +263 78 904 6919: 1.Everyone on my EWYL team is so concerned about me so far
