21/11/23, 10:09 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning Liberty!

*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
21/11/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes that's me
21/11/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Liberty,

You can address me as Mr Singh, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
21/11/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ok Mr Singh
21/11/23, 10:23 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Liberty, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from SHANTEL, is that correct?
21/11/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes I do
21/11/23, 10:28 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Shantel, also do tell me whether you learnt about Shantel’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
21/11/23, 10:31 am - +263 71 802 1612: What I learnt is that the EDOOFA program offers 50%
21/11/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes I did
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
21/11/23, 10:37 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
21/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 150 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
21/11/23, 10:38 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
21/11/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ok
21/11/23, 10:42 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
21/11/23, 11:17 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes it is
21/11/23, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Liberty, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
21/11/23, 11:17 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
21/11/23, 11:18 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
21/11/23, 12:42 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
21/11/23, 12:59 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes do have

Also, although we are proceeding ahead with your consent, I want you to arrange the picture of your result as soon as possible,  Ok?
22/11/23, 9:42 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ok
22/11/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: After understanding your interests and aspirations, pursuing a Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law (BA LLB) can be a strategic and beneficial choice for someone aspiring to study Criminology. Let me break down the reasons why this combination could be advantageous for your goal:
22/11/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Legal Foundation: A BA LLB program provides a solid foundation in legal studies. Understanding the legal system is crucial in criminology as it forms the basis for studying and interpreting laws related to crime, justice, and the overall legal framework.

Interdisciplinary Approach: Criminology is a multidisciplinary field that draws from various disciplines, including law, sociology, psychology, and political science. Pursuing BA LLB allows you to integrate legal studies with other areas, fostering a holistic understanding of the factors influencing crime and criminal behavior.

In-depth Knowledge of Criminal Law: The LLB component of the program focuses specifically on legal principles, including criminal law. This knowledge is invaluable for anyone aiming to specialize in criminology, as it provides a detailed understanding of the laws governing crime, investigations, and the criminal justice system.

Research and Analytical Skills: Both BA and LLB programs emphasize critical thinking, research, and analytical skills. These skills are essential in criminology, where one often needs to analyze complex data, understand legal precedents, and evaluate societal factors influencing criminal behavior.

Ethical Perspective: Legal studies inherently include discussions on ethics and justice. This ethical perspective is crucial in criminology, where professionals need to make ethical decisions, understand the concept of justice, and work towards the fair treatment of individuals within the legal system.

Preparation for Further Studies: If your ultimate goal is to delve deeper into criminology through postgraduate studies, having a legal background can be a significant advantage. Many advanced criminology programs involve legal aspects, and having an LLB degree can open doors to specialized master's or doctoral programs.

Career Opportunities: A BA LLB not only prepares you for a career in law but also opens up diverse career opportunities in areas related to criminology. You could work as a legal consultant, policy analyst, or even pursue roles within law enforcement where a legal background is highly valued.

In summary, pursuing a BA LLB can provide you with a comprehensive skill set and knowledge base that aligns well with the intricacies of criminology. The combination of legal studies and an interdisciplinary approach equips you to understand, analyze, and contribute meaningfully to the field of criminology.
22/11/23, 10:01 am - +263 71 802 1612: So I got to do BALLB first or
22/11/23, 10:08 am - Gurvinder: Yes Liberty, BA LLB will lead you to the path of criminology.
22/11/23, 10:11 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ooooh I didn't know that
22/11/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Yes Liberty.
22/11/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
22/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes I did
22/11/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 802 1612: So how many years does it take to study BA LLB
22/11/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: It takes 5 Years.
22/11/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ooooh ok then.... And what about criminology
22/11/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: Liberty, If you're interested in criminology, pursuing a BA LLB degree is an excellent choice. This program combines the study of law and criminology, giving you a comprehensive understanding of both fields. With a BA LLB degree, you will gain knowledge of the legal system, including criminal law, procedure, and evidence. You will also learn about the psychological, social, and economic factors that contribute to crime. This interdisciplinary approach will equip you with a unique skill set that can help you excel in the field of criminology. Additionally, a BA LLB degree can open up a wide range of career opportunities, including working as a criminal lawyer, prosecutor, or judge. By pursuing a BA LLB degree, you will be taking a significant step towards a rewarding and fulfilling career in criminology.
22/11/23, 10:32 am - Gurvinder: So there is no need to do any other course after this for criminology.
22/11/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ooooh ok I understand
22/11/23, 10:41 am - Gurvinder: Yes.

22/11/23, 10:42 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yeah I do
22/11/23, 10:43 am - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
22/11/23, 11:01 am - +263 71 802 1612: sorry I will answer later right now am busy
22/11/23, 11:01 am - Gurvinder: Then do let me know when will you be available.

22/11/23, 5:02 pm - Gurvinder: Well Liberty, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care, address my question, and do watch the video I am sharing below.

23/11/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 802 1612: To commence with,  by pursuing this BA LLB degree I see myself as a successful personal in the criminology field. I wish to work overseas because there are greater opportunities compared here in Zimbabwe....I would also love to take care of my family mostly my little sister because she's the only blood I got.
23/11/23, 11:10 am - Gurvinder: That is really great Liberty, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
23/11/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes I am
23/11/23, 1:09 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
23/11/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 802 1612: It's because that,  here in Zimbabwe I can't acquire such program due to my level of passing
23/11/23, 3:05 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
23/11/23, 3:06 pm - Gurvinder: In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
23/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 802 1612: I don't want to lie,  on that issue. It's  hard to change what is already on place
23/11/23, 3:23 pm - Gurvinder: But Liberty, after getting into this prestige program where you will get to learn leadership skills that will bring positive change to your life, don't you want that after all that, you do something goof for your own country?
23/11/23, 4:50 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes I would love to do that
23/11/23, 4:53 pm - Gurvinder: Well Liberty, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

24/11/23, 1:51 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
24/11/23, 3:24 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yeah I would like to know why
24/11/23, 3:25 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.

24/11/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
24/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 802 1612: No
25/11/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
25/11/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
25/11/23, 9:24 am - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
25/11/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/11/23, 9:25 am - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 802 1612: Ooooh I see
25/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 802 1612: So the scholarship will cover up the 50%
25/11/23, 10:06 am - Gurvinder: Yes the scholarship cover from 50%-100% of the tution fees.
25/11/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 802 1612: What does it take for one  to get a 100%  scholarship
25/11/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Liberty, Please refer to this.
25/11/23, 4:56 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:00 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

27/11/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: In simple words Liberty what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/11/23, 4:54 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
28/11/23, 8:38 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*"Believe you can and you're halfway there."*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
28/11/23, 8:50 am - +263 71 802 1612: Morning
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: Let us continue our session now.
28/11/23, 8:53 am - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
28/11/23, 9:02 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes
28/11/23, 9:04 am - Gurvinder: Liberty, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
28/11/23, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
28/11/23, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
28/11/23, 9:05 am - Gurvinder: Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
28/11/23, 2:41 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Noted
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.

28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
28/11/23, 2:46 pm - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
28/11/23, 4:38 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

30/11/23, 8:28 am - Gurvinder: Please address this.
30/11/23, 8:35 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes it will benefit me
30/11/23, 8:37 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Liberty, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
30/11/23, 4:17 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
30/11/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind.

05/12/23, 8:39 am - Gurvinder: Liberty, Please understand that my time and assistance require a lot of effort. Being one of the senior counsellors who have been assisting the students for the past 5 years, I have loads of other student applications to attend to. I regularly take out time from my  schedule to assist you

So with the utmost respect, please try to reciprocate the same energy by which I am assisting you.

Otherwise, If you do not wish to continue then that is a different matter altogether. you can update me on the same so that I can provide a formal closure to your application

06/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 802 1612: OK,  so that is possible to ask for more assignments
06/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes
06/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Yes that is possible.
06/12/23, 12:51 pm - Gurvinder: Liberty, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
06/12/23, 1:03 pm - +263 71 802 1612: So it is able to give scholarship to some other countries
06/12/23, 1:34 pm - Gurvinder: No, the scholarship seats are only available in India.
06/12/23, 5:02 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Ok I understand
06/12/23, 6:45 pm - Gurvinder: Well, Liberty, we could not have a proper conversation regarding your Application with Edoofa for the Edoofa scholarship Program as you mostly respond after my working hours which is between *7:30 AM and 4:30 PM CAT*. In order to help me conduct a smooth counseling session, I would appreciate it if you are active for at least 2 hours between *7:30 AM-4:30 PM CAT*. <This message was edited>

07/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 802 1612: Good morning
07/12/23, 9:56 am - Gurvinder: Alright Liberty, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
07/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 71 802 1612: Yes
07/12/23, 10:17 am - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
07/12/23, 1:08 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes
07/12/23, 1:16 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
07/12/23, 1:48 pm - +263 71 802 1612: Yes
07/12/23, 2:00 pm - Gurvinder: Liberty as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
07/12/23, 7:58 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead.
