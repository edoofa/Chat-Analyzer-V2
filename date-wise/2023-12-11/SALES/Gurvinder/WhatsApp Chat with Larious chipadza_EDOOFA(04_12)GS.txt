05/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 970 0151: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, Edoofa has worked with 250+ Universities in India and has a community of *more than 3000 students* from different countries📍thats wat he sayed to me
05/12/23, 9:52 am - +263 78 970 0151: This is a very simple scholarship program that offer a 50-100% scholarship to African students. It has an affordable price of learning. It allows students to earn scholarship credits that allows a student to reduce the remaining fee and makes the education affordable for a student.
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: That is correct.
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program.
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
05/12/23, 10:01 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 970 0151: ok sir
05/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 970 0151: understood
05/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 970 0151: thats correct
05/12/23, 10:14 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Larious, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 10:18 am - +263 78 970 0151: yes i do
05/12/23, 10:27 am - Gurvinder: That is great.

*Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law*
06/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 78 970 0151: yeah thanks
06/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 10:58 am - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

06/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: *Bachelor of Arts - Bachelor of Legislative Law* is a 5 year course which integrates Arts with Law. It covers subjects related to Arts field such as Economics, History, Sociology and Political Science etc. alongside specialized fields of law like Criminal Law, Corporate Law, Patent Law, Administrative Law, Tax Law, International Law and Labor Law. This course goes beyond the tedious classroom learning. The time spent during this course is made interesting by constantly organizing the case studies and mock court drills alongside theoretical lectures.

This course is made for the students who are able to formulate sound arguments, can think laterally and possess problem solving skills.
06/12/23, 12:05 pm - Gurvinder: A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.
