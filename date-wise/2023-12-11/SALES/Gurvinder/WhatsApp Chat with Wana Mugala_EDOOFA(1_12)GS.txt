05/12/23, 8:17 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!

*“It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.”*

Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
05/12/23, 8:45 am - +260 760701892: Good morning.
Can't wait for the meeting!
05/12/23, 9:01 am - +260 760701892: Good morning, all ready here. It's 9AM!
05/12/23, 9:16 am - Gurvinder: It is a pleasure to connect with you today Wana,

You can address me as Mr Gurvinder, we do have Mr Shubham, Senior Academician and  Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
05/12/23, 9:20 am - +260 760701892: Thank you Mr Gurvinder, it's a pleasure to connect with you and the rest of your board.
05/12/23, 9:31 am - Gurvinder: Alright, so Wana, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Tapiwanashe, is that correct?
05/12/23, 9:33 am - +260 760701892: No, I got to know if from Francine Chilabi.
05/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 9:44 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what all did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Francine, also do tell me whether you learnt about Francine’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
05/12/23, 9:54 am - +260 760701892: Well, she told me this is a scholarship board and not sponsorship and all scholarships are all merit based, and no, I didn't learn about her journey.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Noted.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the program myself.
05/12/23, 10:03 am - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*

One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls. *Edoofa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.*
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students.
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: *Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia*
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 10:04 am - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
05/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 760701892: Well thanks very much for the briefing
05/12/23, 10:21 am - +260 760701892: Yes that is right
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Okay so Wana, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
05/12/23, 10:30 am - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
05/12/23, 10:38 am - +260 760701892: No I don't think I have what it takes to get a high quantum of scholarship.
05/12/23, 11:31 am - Gurvinder: And may I know why is that?
05/12/23, 11:46 am - +260 760701892: Well that's because both of my parents are rarely home, they are usually at farm outside town were network is poor, they usually just during weekends.
That may affect the the second point on parent participation.
05/12/23, 12:06 pm - Gurvinder: Noted, let us continue the counseling session and I hope you will discuss with them about the session.
05/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Now Wana, I would like to know you better as a student. Please go ahead, and tell me in 150 to 200 words about yourself, your career aspiration do include sharing about:-

1. Your highest education level?
2. The course you would like to study?
3. What do your parents do?
4. What is your parent’s highest education level?
5. Who has been supporting you for your Education so far?
6. Who will be supporting you financially for your higher education abroad?
7. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do?
8. May I know which school do you study at and in which province is it located along with that how much was your per-term fee in A level?

Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way
05/12/23, 12:31 pm - +260 760701892: Am an 18 year old Zambian citizen who completed secondary school last year at Hillcrest National Secondary School.

Since I could not afford paying that amount, I applied for a government student loan to find my university education
05/12/23, 1:42 pm - Gurvinder: The question mentions clearly about A-level education, now you are giving me answer for your University.

06/12/23, 12:03 pm - +260 760701892: Good afternoon Mr Gurvinder. Hope you are well!
06/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
06/12/23, 12:07 pm - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.
06/12/23, 12:09 pm - +260 760701892: Am confident enough about it.
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: So shall I brief you about the course?
06/12/23, 12:13 pm - +260 760701892: Yes please!

06/12/23, 1:36 pm - +260 760701892: Thanks for the information. Very helpful indeed. Can I ask a question? Just to clarify
06/12/23, 1:45 pm - Gurvinder: Did you understand the course?
06/12/23, 1:51 pm - +260 760701892: Yes but not fully.
06/12/23, 1:59 pm - Gurvinder: Yes please share your concern.
06/12/23, 2:02 pm - +260 760701892: Quiet alright I've done research on the course business administration and the like, but in terms of the University entry have I been selected for diploma or bachelor's degree?
06/12/23, 2:04 pm - Gurvinder: As you are not doing Grade 12 I can only offer you a diploma.
06/12/23, 2:05 pm - +260 760701892: I completed my grade 12 last year.
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - Gurvinder: As you have shown interest in doing Commercials but you do not have any commercial subject in grade 12 that is why I gave you a diploma.
06/12/23, 2:07 pm - +260 760701892: Kindly go through my grade results here.
06/12/23, 2:08 pm - +260 760701892: Okay I understand now Sir.
06/12/23, 2:08 pm - Gurvinder: Now you understand?
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I do
06/12/23, 2:09 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 150 to 200 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
06/12/23, 2:48 pm - +260 760701892: Well eventually after graduation I will have to look for job to earn some money as I facilitate my business ideas. I do have many ideas but I'll explain on one. We see here in Zambia car dealers usually overpice used cars that are imported from Japan and other countries because people do not know how to import cars and many others feel lazy of the procedure involved. I recently discovered that there are junkyards are in Japan that have good running cars just parked and abandoned, so I plan to be link between those junkyards and potential car buyers in Zambia that'll see people getting cars at upto 20% cheaper than most car dealers offer and will see more and more people in Zambia driving and not walking. Well, the Edoofa program will help me by gaining an international standard of the business world and see how business is done in the other countries such as India so that I can learn new things about business and international partnership between companies.
06/12/23, 2:53 pm - Gurvinder: That is really great Wana, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I am willing to work very hard to achieve that.
06/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
06/12/23, 3:34 pm - +260 760701892: Mainly to see the world and have a different experience. Everyone I know at home studied within so I'd like to have a different experience.
06/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
06/12/23, 3:52 pm - +260 760701892: I'd advocate for the reintroduction of STEM education in Zambia
06/12/23, 3:53 pm - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Wana, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
06/12/23, 3:54 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I fully agree.
06/12/23, 3:55 pm - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
06/12/23, 4:03 pm - +260 760701892: Yes, why is it so?
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa’s vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India’s Independence.
06/12/23, 4:06 pm - Gurvinder: *Following are the reasons as to Why Edoofa Focuses on India for Scholarships: A Quick Look!*

1. *Robust Education System:* India has 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges offering diverse educational paths.

07/12/23, 1:07 pm - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - +260 760701892: No we are not familiar.
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
07/12/23, 2:51 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
07/12/23, 2:52 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
07/12/23, 2:55 pm - +260 760701892: I see the difference in costs and that's very huge compared to western countries, but I'll have to ask my parents tonight when they are back.
07/12/23, 2:56 pm - Gurvinder: In simple words Wana, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
07/12/23, 2:57 pm - Gurvinder: Yes you would be allowed to do that but I want you to finish the counselling session today so that your chances of a scholarship increase.
07/12/23, 2:58 pm - +260 760701892: Ohh I understand now.
07/12/23, 2:59 pm - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
07/12/23, 3:00 pm - +260 760701892: Yes.
07/12/23, 3:03 pm - Gurvinder: Wana, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
07/12/23, 5:19 pm - +260 760701892: That's a very good program!
07/12/23, 8:00 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you *tomorrow again at 9AM CAT* to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
08/12/23, 7:45 am - Gurvinder: Good Morning, Everyone!
“Set your goals high, and don’t stop till you get there.”
Let's make today count by participating actively and exploring the exciting journey ahead together! Your presence can truly make a difference.
08/12/23, 10:25 am - +260 760701892: Good morning!
Ready for the day.
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: So let us continue the session now.
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
08/12/23, 10:46 am - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*

08/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
08/12/23, 10:47 am - Gurvinder: *What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
08/12/23, 12:10 pm - +260 760701892: The EWYL is a very good initiative but doesn't it get too stressful for students seeing that they might be doing school assignments as well as the EWYL projects??
08/12/23, 12:39 pm - Gurvinder: The EWYL program is just for a student's benefit, it is not compulsory for a student to take part in this program, but it is beneficial for them only, now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
08/12/23, 12:43 pm - +260 760701892: I understand now. It's actually very good I guess.
08/12/23, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

08/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.
08/12/23, 12:58 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
08/12/23, 1:26 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
08/12/23, 2:04 pm - +260 760701892: Yes we are still together Sir.
08/12/23, 2:22 pm - Gurvinder: Please address this.
08/12/23, 2:25 pm - +260 760701892: Yes that's a whole different experience because such type of a program is not available in Zambia. Yes I've been looking for a different type of education.
08/12/23, 2:33 pm - Gurvinder: Wana, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.
08/12/23, 2:45 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I understand and I've seen your commitment on providing the best for the student.
08/12/23, 2:55 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Wana, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
08/12/23, 3:24 pm - +260 760701892: No not really
Initial plan is to look for a fully funded scholarship. Even if I don't manage to get scholarship and remain local I'd have to rely on a government student loan to fund my education.
08/12/23, 3:30 pm - Gurvinder: Are your brothers not willing to support you for your higher education?
08/12/23, 3:35 pm - +260 760701892: He would be willing but financial situation wouldn't allow seeing that he recently got employed earlier on in may and him being a new employee they are on minimum salary scale.
And looking at the current exchange rate of dollar to kwacha it wouldn't allow <This message was edited>
08/12/23, 3:36 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
08/12/23, 3:37 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so may I know if you have discussed international education plans with them in depth?
08/12/23, 3:42 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I did. They told me it's better to go under government sponsor and currently the higher education scholarship and loans board under the government offering fully funded scholarship but they usually advertise in a period of 3months. Some students were taken to Morocco and Algeria last month but the deal breaker for me was learning in French.
So I've looking for a country which can offer education in English.
08/12/23, 4:25 pm - Gurvinder: Well Dear, I would have loved to continue with the conversation now but it’s been a long day already and my working hours are over for the day as well, so, I would connect with you tomorrow again at 9AM CAT to continue with our conversation with a fresh mind. Till then please take care.

Have a good day ahead. 
God Bless You!
09/12/23, 10:21 am - Gurvinder: Good Afternoon Everyone,
Excuse me for the delay as I was in a board meeting.

Let us continue the session.
09/12/23, 10:52 am - +260 760701892: Yes let's proceed.
09/12/23, 11:22 am - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
09/12/23, 12:33 pm - Gurvinder: Are we still connected?
09/12/23, 1:09 pm - +260 760701892: Yes I was just finishing up something... 
All ready now
09/12/23, 1:17 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program
