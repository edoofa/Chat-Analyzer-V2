07/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Well received, Anotidaishe, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

07/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

07/12/23, 9:50 am - +263 71 365 0358: Thank you for the information, I now explicitly understand what EDOOFA is about.
07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: It's great to know that you found the information helpful, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Anotidaishe, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD SCHOOL charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

07/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 71 365 0358: As you know, my name is Anotidaishe. I’m an 18 year old boy who did his primary education at Highlands primary school, where I played hockey in the first team since grade 3. I played hockey for 7 years then stopped because ofthe pandemic, I look forward to resume playing hockey in January 2024. I was enrolled at Goromonzi high school in Mashonaland East where I played tennis as a second sport. I became interested in Architecture and started doing Building, technology and design as one of my major subjects and I was one of the top students. I passed 10 Ordinary level subjects and later decided to do arts subjects because had developed more interest in them as time unfolded. Upon deciding to do arts subjects I changed my career path and decided that I want to do social work or anything related to humanitarian aid. I did my Advanced level education at Westminster International School where I studied History, Sociology and Literature in English . I was also the top student in my literature class. I also have good records with all three schools’ teaching staff and extracurricular departments.

The school fees at Westminster International was  $1200 USD 

As for my family, my mother recently left her job as a nurse to work full time in business marketing, which she had started as a side project in 2004. She has an undergraduate marketing degree, and is about to write her final exam for her digital marketing degree. My father is a Car Salesman and also serves as the driver of the car courier as a hobbie, he studied sciences up to A level and decided to follow his father’s footsteps who had interest in cars. I have two younger brothers, one aged 14 and the other aged 10

07/12/23, 10:56 am - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Anotidaishe, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!

It's great to know of your interests in both sports and academics, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 365 0358: Are there any specific requirements or qualifications need to get a scholarship?
07/12/23, 11:17 am - Harmehak: We shall discuss everything in detail as we proceed ahead with the discussion.
07/12/23, 11:18 am - Harmehak: Well Anotidaishe now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
07/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 365 0358: I believe tertiary education fosters growth and studying abroad would be a change for development of exposure in an individual and is a doorway for cultural diversity and cohesion.

And I do believe that it’s a life changing decision.
07/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: Well put across, Anotidaishe.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
07/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 365 0358: Yes, I’m prepared for life abroad.
07/12/23, 12:09 pm - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
07/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 365 0358: My family is fully aware of this decision and they are willing to support me both mentally and financially.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please, Anotidaishe.
07/12/23, 12:36 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

08/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: I understand please!
08/12/23, 10:03 am - Harmehak: So Anotidaishe, what motivates you to study social work/humanitarian aid?
08/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 71 365 0358: Firstly I’ve always wanted to work for the United Nations ever since I learnt about Bismark when I was doing my O level. I developed interest in changing the world and people’s lives and doing social work is a stepping stone. I plan doing bigger probably peace keeping or security for the United Nations.
08/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Well that's surely well thought off,

Let me share more details about your desired field
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Now let me help you have a better understanding, social work is a great course at the current time. From my personal experience of being in the field of education, I see many students apply for the course, but being a very niche course, a lot of universities don't offer the same because the cost of the course is very high and since it's a practical course, and the ones who do they don't offer scholarships on the course as the investment to teach such a course to a number of students becomes very high for the university as well. 

Now usually what students do is, that they pursue a course that is similar to this particular course. A student can do all the related jobs without a degree of social work. A lot of time students pursue a course called Bachelor of Sociology. The base of this course and the base of social work as a course in similar in nature which is why students who pursue this course end up having career opportunities in the field of social work!
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: Social work and sociology have many similarities when it comes to career aspirations. For both professions, the main goal is to work with individuals, families, and communities to improve the quality of life and promote positive change. Both social work and sociology focus on understanding the causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them.

Social workers and sociologists use similar skills and approaches to help people, including interviewing, counseling, advocating, and providing support and resources. They also draw on research methods and theories to inform their practice and shape their interventions. For example, sociologists may conduct research on a particular population to gain a better understanding of how their environment, culture, and other factors influence their behavior and quality of life. This knowledge can then be applied to the development of social policy and change initiatives.

Both social workers and sociologists also strive to create a more equitable and just society. They recognize the importance of understanding and appreciating diversity, as well as the need to challenge oppression, discrimination, and social injustice. They work together to create an environment that values and respects all people, regardless of race, gender, class, or other factors.

Overall, social work and sociology have similar goals and approaches to promoting positive change. They both recognize the importance of understanding the root causes of social problems and developing strategies to address them. They also strive to create a more equitable and just society by challenging oppression, discrimination, and social injustice.
08/12/23, 11:09 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me please
08/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 365 0358: I have read it and have understood more about social work and sociology, thank you for the information.
08/12/23, 11:32 am - Harmehak: That's good,

So now shall I brief you Bachelors in Sociology, Anotidaishe?
08/12/23, 11:38 am - +263 71 365 0358: No thanks you, im fully aware about how studies in sociology are as I was informed by my sociology teachers
08/12/23, 11:41 am - Harmehak: Thats great, however I am referring to the Degree that you would be studying!
08/12/23, 12:03 pm - +263 71 365 0358: You may brief me then
08/12/23, 12:05 pm - Harmehak: *B.A. (Hons.) in Sociology* is an undergraduate program that deals with various aspects of social behavior and its consequence on modern society.

08/12/23, 12:18 pm - Harmehak: Kindly inform me once you have read it
08/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I have read it.
08/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Alright Anotidaishe, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
08/12/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 365 0358: If I do sociology I think the career opportunities are wider in the field of social work and humanitarian aid as it appears to be social work at a larger scale. It can enable me to achieve my dreams as the career paths are similar. In 5 years I will be starting my career in social work preparing to get my masters degree.
08/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: That is really great Anotidaishe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
08/12/23, 12:52 pm - Harmehak: Do ensure active participation as well.
08/12/23, 12:55 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I want to study abroad to gain exposure, learn what’s happening outside of Zimbabwe and get to know the world better.
08/12/23, 12:56 pm - Harmehak: It's wonderful that you are looking at maximum exposure, Anotidaishe!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
08/12/23, 1:12 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I’ve been learning about India for years now. I’ve understood that India is a very cultured and religious place. Cricket is also the most popular sport in India, which is the same as Zimbabwe and has over 20 languages 

It is also the second most populous country which would be an advantage in gaining exposure as it has social diversity, this also makes studying sociology in India more relevant than most countries. The cost of living in India is also low which makes life easier for students. Due to the existence of strong culture and religion there is high mortality and this creates a friendly and safe environment for foreign students
08/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see your knowledge and awareness, Anotidaishe!
08/12/23, 1:14 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

08/12/23, 1:36 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful, Anotidaishe 

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
08/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 365 0358: We had not looked at the costs yet
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
08/12/23, 1:48 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
08/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 365 0358: Noted
08/12/23, 2:07 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I think it’s very helpful and I don’t mind working as I study
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great
08/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 365 0358: I agree
08/12/23, 2:24 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Anotidaishe?
08/12/23, 2:35 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 71 365 0358: Good morning, I’m doing well

We may continue
09/12/23, 9:43 am - Harmehak: You can address the same please.
09/12/23, 9:47 am - +263 71 365 0358: Yes, I am now in a better position to relate
09/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
09/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
09/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
09/12/23, 9:51 am - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

09/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly follow the resources and information, Anotidaishe?
09/12/23, 10:08 am - +263 71 365 0358: I haven’t watched the videos yet, the internet is slow but they are loading
09/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: I do understand, Anotidaishe
09/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
09/12/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 365 0358: I understand
09/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

09/12/23, 10:39 am - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
09/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 71 365 0358: I’m ready
09/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: Anotidaishe, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
09/12/23, 10:43 am - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
09/12/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 365 0358: Between $1500- $2250
09/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
09/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
09/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: You see Anotidaishe, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
09/12/23, 10:54 am - +263 71 365 0358: I think its fair
09/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
09/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
09/12/23, 10:57 am - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
09/12/23, 11:00 am - +263 71 365 0358: I understand
09/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
09/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
09/12/23, 11:03 am - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
09/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 365 0358: I understand the process
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 71 365 0358: So I can choose any University in India?
09/12/23, 11:11 am - Harmehak: When you would be connecting with the Admissions Officer, they would share acceptance letters from multiple universities where your application would have qualified for.

After the same you would be having a thorough discussion with your family and then you would finalize the university.
09/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 71 365 0358: Ok, I see
09/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
09/12/23, 11:16 am - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

09/12/23, 11:22 am - Harmehak: Yes please,

Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well
09/12/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 365 0358: I will
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

09/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: I would also like to share the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. Do share the same with your parents so that if they would like to confirm anything they could get it confirmed please.
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Harmehak: Also have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session.

Your scholarship journey is reaching a crucial juncture. *Monday on “11-12-23” at 10:30 P.M. CAT,* I will meticulously evaluate your application. This session is not just about answering your questions; it includes a vital Eligibility Check Interview.

We strongly recommend parents/guardians join, recognizing that higher education is a family decision. Prepare for a series of interviews, marking a significant phase in finalizing your scholarship application. As your counselor, I wish you the very best. It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

If you qualify for the interview, *Senior Career Counselor Mr Sahil would be getting in touch*, we look forward to welcoming you to India. Please be proactive, as everyone's time is valuable. The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
09/12/23, 11:44 am - +263 71 365 0358: Thank you
09/12/23, 11:45 am - Harmehak: You're welcome
