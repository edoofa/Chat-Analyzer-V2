29/11/23, 1:27 pm - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today?
29/11/23, 1:29 pm - +263 71 756 6029: I am doing well okay thank you...how are you?
29/11/23, 2:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great, Thank you for asking.
29/11/23, 2:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mugede, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year* in India, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity.


So, Are you ready to do that?
29/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 756 6029: Great
29/11/23, 2:12 pm - +263 71 756 6029: I would really appreciate it all and be willing to consider putting in efforts to explore that opportunity.....but still it will all go down to the people who would be financially supporting me ,which are my parents

Shall we begin the session?
08/12/23, 8:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this, Mr. Farai, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
