07/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 78 592 3877: I understand that it is very important to understand the current scholarship scenario.
---Moreover it's the wishes to African students to be fully funded scholarship but continuously academic excellence is one of the most significant criteria for fully funded scholarship and a handful of exceptionally meritorious students meet that.
In addition there is sad part is a very small fraction of students that are able to get outstanding academic records have high GPA because there are very few genuine cheritable organization and as a higher education specialist who has helped tens of thousands of over the last years .a scholarship can only be earned on the basis of merit,talent and attitude.

**I understand that Edoofa are social for-profit organization which aims to help deserving students with life-changing opportunity to further their careers through affordable higher education as well as internship opportunities

09/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 592 3877: Shortages of resources
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Panashe!
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: This message was deleted
09/12/23, 11:17 am - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*



Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it
As your evaluation progresses, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you do any prior research on foreign education or apply to any University abroad?
09/12/23, 11:20 am - +263 78 592 3877: No
09/12/23, 11:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: May I know the reason?
09/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 78 592 3877: Because I don't have money to pay fees abroad
09/12/23, 11:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, Have you compared the cost of education through our program with those in Zimbabwe?
09/12/23, 11:28 am - +263 78 592 3877: Not yet
09/12/23, 11:33 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, So, according to you how much is the cost of education through our program?
09/12/23, 11:40 am - +263 78 592 3877: 50-100% school credits
09/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: That is right!!
09/12/23, 11:44 am - Pallika Edoofa: But I was asking you the cost in USD.
09/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 78 592 3877: 6000
09/12/23, 11:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Panashe, I'd like to highlight the financial aspect of higher education in India for international students. On average, the cost ranges from *$6000-$8000 per year*, which, while lower than many Western countries, may still be a hurdle for some. However, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, eligible students can significantly reduce this cost to *$2000-$3000 per year*. Considering the added benefit of enhancing your employability, especially in comparison to opportunities in your hometown, wouldn't you consider putting in the extra effort to explore this opportunity
