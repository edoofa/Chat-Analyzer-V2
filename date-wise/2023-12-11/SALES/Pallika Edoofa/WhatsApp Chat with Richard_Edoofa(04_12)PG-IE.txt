I like geography and mechanics hence  my career goals once clashed as I had to choose whether to go for a mining degree or mechanical engineering degree but I had to choose the latter. I had my o'level at Budiriro B College in gweru mkoba which is situated in the midlands province and came out with 5A's 3B's and a C. I went on to do my A'level with a combination of Physics Mathematics and Geography at Mkoba High school and come out with 5 points. My school fees per term was   $90. My mother is the breadwinner, she works at a parking company called gweru city parking and she's the one will help out with my higher education abroad.
