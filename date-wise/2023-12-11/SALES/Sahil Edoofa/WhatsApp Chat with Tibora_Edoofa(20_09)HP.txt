*I am Ms. Harmehak, Career Counselor at Edoofa* and we have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program for Tibora Moyo. 

As we were flooded with applications today and we didn't want to rush your application, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, I would appreciate if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. 

(Please note: either or both the student and parent can participate)

In the meantime, I am leaving you with a video to go through and learn more about the experience of Proud Edoofians.

21/09/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted please!
21/09/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
21/09/23, 1:52 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes ma'am I have all the above in my subjects

Physical sciences includes both Physics and Chemistry
Life sciences includes Bilogy
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - Harmehak: Very well, do you have any queries for me at the moment please?
21/09/23, 2:29 pm - +27 82 699 3039: No thank you ma'am
21/09/23, 2:30 pm - Harmehak: Alright then Tibora, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
21/09/23, 2:41 pm - +27 82 699 3039: In the next five years i see myself as an integral part of the organization who has helped to contribute to the growth and success of the community. I would like to continue developing my skills and knowledge in order to be able to take on more responsibility within this country or any other.I hope to have built on my skills and gained more responsibility. I'm eager to learn from experienced team members and eventually take on leadership roles. <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 2:43 pm - Harmehak: That is really great and well expressed, Tibora, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
21/09/23, 2:47 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Studying abroad will be  the best and most life-changing experience of my life. I will be able to build a global network before kick-starting my career to experiencing a new culture. 
The benefits to my career and education are significant. Not only that it is the first experience I will get to be fully independent.
21/09/23, 2:52 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Tibora, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure!

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

*May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?*
21/09/23, 2:56 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Education in India focuses on a good blend of academic disciplines of as well as enhancement of necessary skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, decision-making, and essential life skills.Higher education is a priority in India so there are numerous quality options of programmes and courses from which to choose from.
21/09/23, 2:58 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to see you so have thorough awareness and knowledge, Tibora!
21/09/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

*1. Robust Education System:* India boasts the world's third-largest education system, comprising 1000+ universities and 39,931 colleges. This extensive infrastructure provides students with a diverse range of educational opportunities.

I am greatful for the vast amount of knowledge you have provided me
21/09/23, 3:01 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please!

You can thoroughly go through everything.
21/09/23, 3:02 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes ma'am
Thank you
21/09/23, 3:17 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
21/09/23, 3:18 pm - +27 82 699 3039: No ma'am
21/09/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
21/09/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Thank you maam for informing me
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
21/09/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:21 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Thank you for informing us of the costs ma'am
I am very grateful
21/09/23, 3:21 pm - Harmehak: Sure please, Tibora!

In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

Isn't that exciting?
21/09/23, 3:22 pm - +27 82 699 3039: It is very exciting
I am very excited to know more
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful, let me brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would assist you and your parents even further!
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
21/09/23, 3:25 pm - +27 82 699 3039: That is very interesting and generous
21/09/23, 3:26 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

21/09/23, 3:29 pm - Harmehak: May I ask if you are thoroughly following please?
21/09/23, 3:31 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes I am ma'am
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Pleas excuse my late replies 
I am having trouble receiving my messages
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: That's great!
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: That's alright, I do understand please!
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/09/23, 3:33 pm - +27 82 699 3039: So I can earn more than $100 per month <This message was edited>
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: Let me share pictures for the same!
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes ma'am
21/09/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

I am honoured to be considered
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate your kind words, Tibora!
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - +27 82 699 3039: It is my pleasure maam
21/09/23, 3:37 pm - Harmehak: Going through the video will provide you with even better clarity!
21/09/23, 3:38 pm - +27 82 699 3039: I will make sure to go through it again ma'am so I can get better clarity
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, Tibora!
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

Tibora, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
21/09/23, 3:39 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes ma'am I am ready
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: Tibora, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
21/09/23, 3:40 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
21/09/23, 3:42 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Between $1500-$2250
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
21/09/23, 3:43 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:44 pm - +27 82 699 3039: That is amazing and greatly appreciated
21/09/23, 3:44 pm - Harmehak: Tibora, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
21/09/23, 3:45 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes I do think so and it is quite helpful
21/09/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
21/09/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
21/09/23, 3:46 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - +27 82 699 3039: That is so considerate
I would to know more
21/09/23, 3:48 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
21/09/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
21/09/23, 3:49 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
21/09/23, 3:51 pm - +27 82 699 3039: Yes I understand it properly maam
21/09/23, 3:52 pm - Harmehak: Kindly note that once you reach Stage 3, you and your parents would also be connected with parents who have children currently studying in India through Edoofa Scholarship Program from South Africa itself!
21/09/23, 3:52 pm - +27 82 699 3039: That is so great
I am so excited
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2023-2024) and the remaining in January next year (2024-2025).
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
21/09/23, 3:53 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
21/09/23, 3:54 pm - +27 82 699 3039: I am so interested please tell me more
21/09/23, 3:55 pm - Harmehak: We have concluded the session please!

Tibora is there anything you or your parents would like to ask please?
21/09/23, 3:56 pm - +27 82 699 3039: No thank you ma'am
I completely understand everything and I thank you for making the time to communicate with us
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
21/09/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

21/09/23, 3:58 pm - Harmehak: Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions.

I would like to inform you that *tomorrow, at 11 am CAT Mr. Sahil would also be conducting your eligibility check interview* wherein he would be sharing the entire evaluation of your application, interviewing your family members, and sharing the eligibility check test with you as a part of Stage 2. He would assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have.

21/09/23, 4:05 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

25/09/23, 1:28 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So are you ready for the same ?
25/09/23, 1:29 pm - +27 79 326 5797: Very much so
25/09/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
25/09/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
25/09/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
25/09/23, 1:33 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 29th or 30th September 2023 for $200 and the 29th or 30th of October for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 29th or 30th of September 2023.
