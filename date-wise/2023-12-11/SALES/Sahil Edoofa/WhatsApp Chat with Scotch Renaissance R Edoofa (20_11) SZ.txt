21/11/23, 4:51 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Right now I am awaiting advanced level results. I was the vice headgirl of Rusununguko High School this year, I also achieved to contribute in the writing of the 2013 Zimbabwean Constitution.

22/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 400 4614: A good morning to you, my apologies for coming in late. The major challenge we face here is that of reliable network. I have therefore chose to add my contributions before the actual session. As said by her already Renaissance is our third child who prohits serious enthusiasm in learning. She is keen to discover new ideas. Her leadership skills are evidenced on her ability to stand as a deputy head girl at a very big school like Rusununguko High. At 5yrs she was already showing traits of responsibility when she stayed alone in her hotel room in Harare. This was when she was selected to participate in a child rights workshop by a private organisation. Renaissance is a gifted self stater and we are yet to experience problems of mischief as her parents. This is just to battress on what she stated earlier on and I feel my contribution will have a positive impact on your requirements. Thank you.

22/11/23, 5:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Please let me know once you have read all the information, Renaissance.
22/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 400 4614: The educational profile is motivating, we are benefiting.
22/11/23, 7:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in sending Renaissance to India for her higher studies!
22/11/23, 9:33 pm - +263 77 400 4614: Fascinating indeed, yes that's our wish.
22/11/23, 9:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
22/11/23, 9:58 pm - +263 71 879 3497: No, we are not.
22/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Renaissance! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
22/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
22/11/23, 9:59 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
22/11/23, 10:02 pm - +263 71 879 3497: This is wonderful!
22/11/23, 10:14 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
23/11/23, 10:37 am - +263 77 160 1431: Thanks so much for giving finer details about lndia's education system. Having the holistic approach, majoring theory and practical skills takes it to excellence.
23/11/23, 11:27 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

23/11/23, 7:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Renaissance. I will be waiting for your response.
23/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Thank you Mr Shashwat for understanding

*"Success is walking from failure to failure with no loss of enthusiasm." – Winston Churchill*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
24/11/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 879 3497: I am ready
24/11/23, 11:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Renaissance!
24/11/23, 11:29 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know when your parents will be available for the session, please?
24/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 879 3497: I am, thank you. I hope you're too
24/11/23, 11:34 am - +263 71 879 3497: I don't think they'll make it today, that are busy.
24/11/23, 11:40 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Renaissance. Since there are limited seats available and the session needs to abide by a specific timeline, can you please discuss this with them and back to me? Your co-operation is highly valued!
24/11/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 879 3497: Okay, that's fine. I'll definitely give you the feedback before end of day.
24/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 71 879 3497: If that is okay with you?
24/11/23, 1:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: That is totally fine, Renaissance. I will be waiting for your response.
24/11/23, 1:20 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Afternoon Mr Shashwat. They csaid they can afford but they would like to understand better on the issue of travelling expenses. But they can afford the $2000 to $3000
24/11/23, 1:25 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Renaissance!  If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role are not flight tickets because the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times, maybe once or twice, because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So, they learn and do internships during breaks. But still, students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often, so considering the travel fee
(air fare :-around $400) is to be borne by the student which is mostly a one time investment.
24/11/23, 1:26 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, you will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.

Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
24/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Thank you, we're answered, but our main concern was the first travelling ticket from Zimbabwe to India. But all the same you've clarified it.
24/11/23, 1:30 pm - +263 71 879 3497: No, I don't have any idea.
24/11/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 879 3497: It would be very wonderful if I get the opportunity of the internship.
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Renaissance. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
24/11/23, 1:36 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
24/11/23, 1:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
24/11/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Yes, I think this would be very beneficial because I gain experience and apply theory to practical.
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
24/11/23, 2:09 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

24/11/23, 2:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
24/11/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Wow, I'm overwhelmed. This is wonderful. I understand
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
24/11/23, 2:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
24/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 879 3497: I appreciate the Earn while you learn program and the higher education concierge
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It is exhilarating to know that you appreciate these facts, Renaissance! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your backs!
24/11/23, 2:57 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
24/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 879 3497: They have fear of the unknown particularly concerning my safety considering that I'm the last child, but overally they are very keen to have me having higher education abroad.
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand their concerns, Renaissance. I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
24/11/23, 3:04 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 879 3497: That would be very wonderful!
24/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Yes, that is it, I understand. Thank you
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 879 3497: May you furnish me on the duration of the degree programs please?
24/11/23, 3:08 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please elaborate your query, Renaissance?
24/11/23, 3:10 pm - +263 71 879 3497: I need to understand that how long would it take for the completion of the degree program
24/11/23, 3:16 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Renaissance. I would like to inform you that the duration for the *B Tech Computer Science* program is 4 years or 8 semesters, please.
24/11/23, 3:17 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Okay, thank you Mr Shashwat
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: It will be my utmost pleasure to guide you through the process, Renaissance!
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
24/11/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
24/11/23, 3:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 3:23 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
24/11/23, 3:43 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Noted with thanks
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
24/11/23, 3:44 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
24/11/23, 3:47 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Well understood, thank you
24/11/23, 3:48 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
24/11/23, 4:28 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Edoofa helps the student in making the statement of purpose and that itself reduces the cost of higher education, the visa documentation and other necessities needed. Also the Earn while you learn program and the internship will also reduce the cost of higher education and reduce the pressure on  one's parents.
24/11/23, 4:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
24/11/23, 4:36 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Understood, thank you
24/11/23, 4:37 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
24/11/23, 4:39 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Stage 1 
Personalized counselling session
24/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

*Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.

*Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
24/11/23, 4:42 pm - +263 71 879 3497: You can
24/11/23, 4:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).

Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

I hope you are clear with the process?

24/11/23, 4:55 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Yes, it is. Thank you for understanding
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
24/11/23, 4:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)

24/11/23, 4:58 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session. I appreciate your activeness throughout the session. Now before I guide you for Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family

27/11/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Hello Mr Sahil, I'm sorry I am not available right now.
27/11/23, 6:09 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I apologize for the delay today; unfortunately, I'm not feeling well. We'll have to reschedule today's session, and I'll reconnect with you tomorrow at 11:30 PM CAT time
28/11/23, 12:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning

28/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
28/11/23, 12:49 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Mr. Shashwat go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by him during the session?
28/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 71 879 3497: It went very well, yes all my questions were answered
28/11/23, 2:18 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So far do you have any questions for me ?
28/11/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 879 3497: No, I do not have any questions
28/11/23, 3:39 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
28/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Very true. No, we haven't connected with her
28/11/23, 4:12 pm - +263 77 400 4614: Greetings to you sir, oh yes Ruth's story is an amazing and encouraging one. We definitely wish to connect to her earliest.
28/11/23, 4:48 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
29/11/23, 11:32 am - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning 
How are you doing today ?
29/11/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Morning, how are you??

01/12/23, 12:26 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I have been waiting for your response since yesterday may I know what challenges are you facing so that I can help you as delaying the session might reduce your chances of getting the scholarship!
01/12/23, 10:18 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Hello Mr Sahil
01/12/23, 10:23 pm - +263 71 879 3497: We have been facing network and electricity challenges
02/12/23, 12:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good afternoon
Kindly excuse me for the delay I was in a meeting with the academic board.

So shall we start your session now ?
02/12/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 160 1431: Very sorry, we are at our rural home for a funeral. Good day
02/12/23, 3:51 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Answer the questions its been 4 days since they are ignored . <This message was edited>
02/12/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 160 1431: 1.B. Technically Computer science engineering
2. India
3. $6000-8000
4. $2000-3000
5. $350
6. 7 days
7.  Yes
02/12/23, 4:00 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are parents ready for the same ?
02/12/23, 4:01 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Yes
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/12/23, 4:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 7 th  or 8 th December 2023 for $200 and the  7 th  or 8 th of January  for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 7th  or 8th December 2023. Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
02/12/23, 4:03 pm - +263 71 879 3497: Mr Sahil, I hope you understand that we are at a funeral
