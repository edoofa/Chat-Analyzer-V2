For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/11/23, 9:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *EDOOFA has praised the new government for its strong commitment and positive reforms in the education sector.*

The elimination of school fees, increase in the number of teachers, and keeping vulnerable learners, especially adolescent girls, in school are some of the notable positive reforms.
After our successful visit to Zambia and meetings at the Ministries, we have already begun conducting Scholarship Tests and Counseling Sessions at eminent schools in Zambia. Also, *Edoofa is looking for deserving candidates who are meritorious and seek affordable education in the world’s second-largest higher education space.*

Our strong partnerships with educational institutions like *Penmal Connect Ltd.,* and *Trident College* from Zambia have paved the way for numerous success stories along with various institutions like Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, etc! We are also connected with the likes of Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among many others to offer, build and extend the opportunity of the Edoofa Scholarship Program to more and more deserving students across Zambia.

22/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: A delightful evening to you, Remmy!
22/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually you are mistaken over here, Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now A lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
22/11/23, 8:12 pm - +260 95 0013302: Let me know the conditions after the completion of the course ,that in the promising future, l will work for the organization on a period of time which will be given to me 
I need a sponsorship please

22/11/23, 9:03 pm - +260 95 0013302: 🦚Stay blessed too. We shall resume at the  time you have instructed.
22/11/23, 9:20 pm - +260 95 0013302: Want an amazing information and an experience by students, really amazing and l  delighted to be there with an aim of attaining the successful and prosperous future amid the procedures set forth by your institution once the  opportunity is granted.
23/11/23, 8:21 am - +260 95 0013302: Hello 

We may resume our session with activeness and participation l have taken .
23/11/23, 8:22 am - +260 95 0013302: Good morning!!

24/11/23, 4:59 pm - +260 95 0013302: Edoofa is an higher education institution based in India which provides excellent and high academic courses depending on the merit of the student.

This institution can help students with scholarships through it's high Structured and practical learning and internship programs that are supervised under medical positions by advanced graduates gaining medical experience.

Edoofa gets scholarship grants from the education trusts of government -recognised and accredited universities which amounts to $10,000 to provide affordable facilitation in learning and expenses to edoofian students approved by the counselor which benefits students by making education affordable by this grant. 

In addition to this, Edoofa  has recommended lndia for higher education because globally it has a cutting -edge education provided by this institution, with advanced medical technology as one of the highest and advanced level with medical experience and producer of highly professional doctors, have cultural ethos such as deep vally, rivers and thick forests and  high mountains, offer proper medium of English and instructions to learners that to become prosperous future leaders. 

On the other hand, Edoofa is a highest power house of education that have stood above other universities in greater degree and intensity postgraduate with highest cultural features described in above paragraph that other countries doesn't have.

Edoofa S.E.E.L.S  abbreviation which stands for Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning Success, most students are redeemed through scholarship credits as acknowledgements or respects for producing quality results through tasks and given assignments. By these tasks and assignments, a Student can earn in a month up to $50-$100 even up to $125 as efforts and excellent  active participation is involved. 

Edoofa scholarship credits are not compulsory offered by the school but only to students that perform well in their tasks and given projects who are regular and diligent with their work ,not only that but also provides VISA which is successfully done through norms laid down by authorities like Embassy and lndian government of Home Affairs.

While in case if my results are not announced yet, this is what l need to do,to share my recent provisions academic document with the counselor through the provision route. 

Accordingly, Edoofa program is different from other colleges or scholarship it is because Edoofa is affortable through guaranted scholarships, employability through practical Learning in which students are helped in Learning and practical skills such as online Business and industrial Programmes which sustains Student to have high electronical skills and earning incomes across countries.
