14/09/23, 3:13 pm - +263 78 644 9292: According to my knowledge is a program from  India which provides scholarships in different countries in AFRICA,, HOWEVER through the famed Edoofa program, Edoofa has reserved seats with Indian universities and colleges for selected students who as a part of the Edoofa program are offered scholarships ranging from 50-100% of their tuition fees.
14/09/23, 3:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: You really have a good grasp of the program, but I'll explain it further.

The *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is an innovative initiative spearheaded by Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd. as part of the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) program. This program aims to address the challenges of affordability and employability in higher education by empowering students to both earn scholarship credits and acquire essential 21st-century job skills. Through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, deserving students, known as Edoofians, can avail themselves of scholarships ranging from 50% to 100%, enabling them to pursue their desired courses while actively engaging in live projects that contribute to their scholarship credits. This approach particularly assists African students in self-financing their education.

In essence, the Edoofa Program, through its SEELS initiative, acts as a bridge between financial assistance, college education, and the enhancement of employability skills.
14/09/23, 3:51 pm - +91 82875 72068: It's worth noting that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is highly competitive, with approximately 50,000 applicants vying for just 1,500 scholarship positions. Given this intense competition, our conversation will be far from ordinary – I'll be guiding you towards readiness for the Eligibility Check Interview. As your counselor, we'll delve into your application details, including your chosen course, preferred country for education, financial considerations, university options, and more. Following our discussions, you'll proceed with the Eligibility Procedures, which encompass a scholarship test and an interview with the Program Manager.

Successfully navigating these Eligibility Check Procedures is essential to secure your qualification for the scholarship. Are you prepared to compete?

We will now connect with you for the upcoming session on *Tuesday, October 3rd, 2023, at 9:00 AM CAT*, where I will provide you with valuable insights into the Edoofa Scholarship program. Since it's the weekend and on Monday, October 2nd, 2023, We celebrate Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday here in India, our offices will be closed in observance of this special day. 

Hence I kindly request you to prepare any questions or topics you'd like to discuss during the session and ensure you are ready to join us promptly at *9:00 AM CAT on Tuesday*. We are committed to assisting you in your educational journey and looking forward to connecting with you.
30/09/23, 7:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: In the meantime please go through the links I am sharing for a better understanding of the program

04/10/23, 1:16 pm - +91 82875 72068: A very pleasant afternoon to everyone. I am done with my lunch. Thank you for your patience.
04/10/23, 1:36 pm - +91 82875 72068: Not to worry, Tadiwanashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation

04/10/23, 1:37 pm - +91 82875 72068: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
04/10/23, 2:37 pm - +263 78 644 9292: I understand ,, will ask my parents, so that I tell you the correct answer, whether they afford or they not. Now my parents are offline or they reply this massage themselves
04/10/23, 2:52 pm - +91 82875 72068: I can understand, Tadiwanashe. I will be waiting for their response.

05/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 644 9292: Good morning sir  , yes I'm ready
05/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 644 9292: I talk with my parents about the issue
05/10/23, 9:46 am - +263 78 644 9292: They said they don't afford 🥹
05/10/23, 10:20 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tadiwanashe. I would like to inform you that if you demonstrate exceptional performance and clear all the criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for our prestigious 90-100% Scholarship! This means you will only need to pay a minimal fee of $1250-$1500 that covers all your expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc.
05/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 966 4244: Oky sir thank you, I understand
05/10/23, 12:06 pm - +91 82875 72068: May I know whether you think that is affordable, please?
05/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yes this one is affordable
05/10/23, 12:39 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tadiwanashe. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
05/10/23, 4:31 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yes guide me, sir .
Yeah that's good also to do some party time works, that's true you can use that money to pay fees
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tadiwanashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
05/10/23, 4:33 pm - +91 82875 72068: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.

06/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 410 3294: Noted
07/10/23, 10:26 am - +91 82875 72068: Well, Tadiwanashe, may I know whether *EWYL* will be beneficial for you, please?
07/10/23, 10:34 am - +263 71 966 4244: Yes sir it will benefit me
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $60-$90 a month
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
07/10/23, 10:36 am - +91 82875 72068: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yes sir I understand
13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
13/10/23, 2:11 pm - +91 82875 72068: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I will be waiting for your response.

01/11/23, 3:55 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Hello Tadiwanashe, I hope you are doing well.

Because of the high number of applications we have received for 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria. 

In these large number of applications I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.

Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
01/11/23, 11:44 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Hey good evening sir ,
01/11/23, 11:44 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yes I will be able sir
01/11/23, 11:44 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Thank you sir , I'm willing to get the seat😫
Please do me a favor sir
01/11/23, 11:45 pm - +263 71 966 4244: I will finish my exams this Friday , so that we have more time to discuss

03/11/23, 12:33 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
03/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
03/11/23, 12:34 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
03/11/23, 5:35 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.

Employability through practical training

04/11/23, 10:10 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know which one is your favourite, please?
04/11/23, 10:12 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Employability through practical training
04/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am delighted to hear that, Tadiwanashe! The role of practical training in an educational journey is of paramount importance. It serves as the bridge between theoretical knowledge and real-world application, equipping students with the essential skills and experiences needed to thrive in their chosen fields. Practical training cultivates problem-solving abilities, critical thinking, and hands-on expertise that textbooks and lectures alone cannot provide. It offers a deeper understanding of the subject matter, promotes self-confidence, and prepares individuals for the challenges they will encounter in their professional careers!
04/11/23, 10:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
04/11/23, 10:17 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yeah that's good sir
04/11/23, 10:19 pm - +263 71 966 4244: They feel happy and they wish me to go abroad , this is a good thing so obviously my parents will appreciate it
04/11/23, 10:21 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
04/11/23, 10:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
04/11/23, 10:27 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Yes  that's true and  the results from yr academic school
04/11/23, 10:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
04/11/23, 10:29 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
04/11/23, 10:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
04/11/23, 10:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
04/11/23, 10:36 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Well sir I'm glad to hear that , so i will notify my parents tomorrow so that we can know the next step
04/11/23, 10:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
04/11/23, 10:38 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
04/11/23, 10:40 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Well sir I understand, so we all both waiting the respond of my parents
04/11/23, 10:42 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can understand, Tadiwanashe. However, I would request you to be active for the next 10 minutes as we are about to conclude the session.
04/11/23, 10:43 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Oky sir
04/11/23, 10:43 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
04/11/23, 10:49 pm - +263 71 966 4244: Well ,EDOOFA helps student to pay his or her finances through a program called earn while you learn whereby students can go to work but still at school so this helps student to pay some of their bills themselves
04/11/23, 10:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.

*Enrollment fee*
The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days 
 
For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350
 
*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1200-$1800 per annum
 
This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program. <This message was edited>
