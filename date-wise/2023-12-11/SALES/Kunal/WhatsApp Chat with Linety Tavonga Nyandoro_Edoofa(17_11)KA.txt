If found eligible,are you in a position to raise them?
08/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 725 8078: Yes
08/12/23, 2:55 pm - +263 71 255 2076: How much is the cost

08/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 71 255 2076: This message was deleted
08/12/23, 5:23 pm - +263 71 255 2076: K let me go through it and is it okay if we can resume this conversation on monday at 10am
08/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 71 255 2076: Yes the cost of transport and living so i can know if its affordable
08/12/23, 5:33 pm - Kunal: That would be fine
08/12/23, 5:33 pm - Kunal: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered. So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
*(air fare :-around $400,Visa fee:-$83) is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment. <This message was edited>

09/12/23, 10:31 am - Kunal: Good Morning,

09/12/23, 10:55 am - Kunal: Please share what you have understood from the program in detail
09/12/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 725 8078: I understood that if the student got certain number of percentages varying from 50-100 ,the student's family would have to pay $2000 - $3000 per year that is for the cost of living
09/12/23, 11:07 am - Kunal: That is correct
Have you discussed about the same with your family?
09/12/23, 11:09 am - +263 71 725 8078: Yes,they say that we can't afford such amount due to the fact that there are my siblings who are still going to school therefore needs schools fees and so on
09/12/23, 11:15 am - Kunal: I understand
So, how are you going to proceed with your higher education?
09/12/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 725 8078: For now l have no option,that is the reason why l looked for scholarship so that I can proceed with education
