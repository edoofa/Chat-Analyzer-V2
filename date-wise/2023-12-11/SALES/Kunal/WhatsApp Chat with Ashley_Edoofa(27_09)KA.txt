How are you doing?
13/10/23, 4:58 pm - Kunal: Hello Ashley, I hope you are doing well.
Because of the high number of applications we have received for the 2024 & 2025 intake, Edoofa Academic Board has recommended all sincere higher education aspirants to proceed for the Eligibility Check Interviews, if you are one of these feel free to enquire about the eligibility criteria.
In this large number of applications, I have identified you as a genuine higher education seeker, so it's a recommendation that you follow this instruction diligently.
Will you be able to complete the next step in the next 36 hours?
17/10/23, 9:03 am - Kunal: Good day to all,

I trust this message finds you in good health.

Having received your application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I understand that you are seeking an opportunity not only to study abroad but also to build a career abroad through affordable, accessible, and employable education. However, over the last few days, it seems you haven't been able to respond, possibly due to reasons I am not aware of. This has led to an incomplete discussion regarding your scholarship application.

Often, we might have questions, queries, or doubts in our minds that we hesitate to share with others, assuming we might be judged or not understood properly. I want to assure you that at Edoofa, we are here to help you gain a comprehensive understanding of the entire process and address each and every doubt you may have.

In order to assist you in achieving an 80-100% scholarship, I am looking forward to a positive response from you soon.

Best regards,

Kunal

Presenting my strengths,iam good at leadership traits as i was once a school headboy during my academic  course which i finished on 13 November 2023.However I have some weaknesses also,some of them includes low self esteem sometimes. As a boy who loves associating with others,I spent my time training my community choir as iam good at singing and conducting choir. Explaining my family background,I come from a certain growth point in Zimbabwe thus making us low income earners as sometimes we struggle in terms of financial issues .                                                         .                                                                     Referring to my current educational levels starting with O'level, i have 5 O'level subjects and iam waiting for A' level results release in January 2024.With reference to my A'level combination,i would like to study Business management. The reason why i chose this course is that because this had been my dream since primary level,and I'm much interested in innovating business ideas and proudly in need to be a business man in future.My subject combination included,Accounting,Economics and Business studies.In explanation to my my parent's professions starting with my mother,she is a college clerk whilst my father is a driver.                                                       .                                                                     Referring to my family again,I have two siblings which makes me the older one.My two little brothers are in primary levels now meaning they don't have any occupation for now. Till I finished my A'level academic course,my parents were the ones who were financially supporting me throughout and I hope they will be the ones who will support my higher education abroad.My per-term school fees was $70,00.
