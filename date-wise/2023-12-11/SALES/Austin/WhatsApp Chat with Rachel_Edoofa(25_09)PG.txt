A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much-needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which needs a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information through networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?

03/10/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please share your understanding on this.
03/10/23, 4:32 pm - +263 78 875 6065: It's very expensive
03/10/23, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rachel, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
03/10/23, 4:34 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 78 875 6065: So the needed money is $2000 per semester
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel, it's important to understand that the exact amount can vary and depends on your performance. However, you have the opportunity to reduce this amount through the EWYL Program, where you can earn scholarship credits to help alleviate your tuition fees and ease the financial burden on your parents.
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
03/10/23, 5:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

May I know if you are available for the discussion?

I am here to begin our discussion,

Shall we begin our session?
11/10/23, 8:42 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Rachel,


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
11/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Okay I understand
11/10/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that Rachel,

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.

12/10/23, 8:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings!

12/10/23, 12:25 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today.

12/10/23, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

12/10/23, 12:31 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
12/10/23, 12:34 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Sure
12/10/23, 12:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please acknowledge this.
12/10/23, 12:37 pm - +263 78 875 6065: My guardian
12/10/23, 12:50 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel, kindly specify which guardian you are referring to, and confirm whether that guardian has been included in this group.
12/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Yes he's in the group I added him but currently he's not active
12/10/23, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's alright, Rachel
12/10/23, 12:51 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing further, So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
12/10/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Yes
12/10/23, 12:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this.
12/10/23, 12:54 pm - +263 78 875 6065: They are wishing me the best that if l succeed in life l will be able to provide their needs and wants
12/10/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
12/10/23, 12:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
12/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Yes it is
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/10/23, 1:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
12/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Okay
12/10/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please acknowledge this.
12/10/23, 1:04 pm - +263 78 875 6065: Okay thanks
12/10/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Rachel, please read it properly, Shall I explain?
12/10/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 875 6065: I read it
12/10/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
12/10/23, 1:08 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/10/23, 1:09 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
12/10/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 875 6065: OKay
12/10/23, 9:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rachel

13/10/23, 9:50 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Rachel.
13/10/23, 9:51 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you have understood the process up to this
13/10/23, 9:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 875 6065: Stage 1
13/10/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's right, Rachel!!!
13/10/23, 10:03 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
13/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 78 875 6065: Yes sure
13/10/23, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rachel <This message was edited>
13/10/23, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
13/10/23, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
13/10/23, 10:10 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
13/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 78 875 6065: Yes sure
13/10/23, 10:18 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Rachel, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*

15/10/23, 6:32 pm - Austin: Greetings to you all! 
How are you doing? 

Please excuse me for not getting back to you as per schedule. I had an urgent journey today. Let me know if you are available now and I will guide further.
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Your intake is in August 2024
This cost can be further reduced by you through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family
