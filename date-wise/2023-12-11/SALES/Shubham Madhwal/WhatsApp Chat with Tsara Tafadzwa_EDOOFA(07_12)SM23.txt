Welcome to the Edoofa Scholarship Counselling Session

Before we begin with the session, I would like to ask you, what prior understanding you have about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
09/12/23, 11:35 am - +263 78 893 2149: Good morning Sit

09/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So let me further elaborate to you on the Edoofa Scholarship Program
Edoofa Scholarship Program is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4500 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability is driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!
09/12/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You know we have been helping students from the African nations and the SAARC countries for the past 6 years and in the short span of 6 years, the most common feedback which we hear from the students is how the Edoofa Program makes the higher education affordable through the financial aid and how it helps the students to make a financial plan to make sure that their dream of higher education abroad is fulfilled.

Basically, our motive is that by providing the SEELS (Students of Edoofa Earning and Learning to Success) initiative, we help our students in Planning and Giving them opportunities through which they can help themselves by self-sponsoring their higher education at the least annual Fee Possible.
09/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 78 016 6548: Okay Sir

*Please elaborate on your answers so that I can understand your application more briefly and assist you in a better way*
09/12/23, 1:05 pm - +263 78 016 6548: My name is Tafadzwa Tsara and am 18 years old and  just finished writing my A'level exams in November .l would like to study International Law abroad .Both my father and mother are teachers.My father and mother have been supporting my Education so far and they will surely support me financially for higher education abroad. l have one sister who just graduated her final Honours Degree in Biotechnology this year in October and is now looking for a job.l studied at Marange UMC High school form 1-6 in Manicaland  .The fees is 420 us dollars per term
09/12/23, 1:30 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Can you also share a bit about the current/previous school you are studying at, How studying at that school helped you in becoming an overall better person, what all activities did you participate in your school for your holistic growth?
09/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 016 6548: l studied at Marange High School in Mutare ,Manicaland .So as l studied there l learnt that at times its not always about reading books and learn but caring and sharing is one of the essential things l discovered .l also learnt that of course we are different people but that does not stop us from helping , we should work hand in glove inorder to be successful in life. So as l was studying at Marange High School l became part and parcel of the Interact club as a Tail Twister, this club was  giving charity to underpriviledged children and those that did not have something to wear.This contributed to my holistic growth as it taught me to share the little that you have .l also participated in the Ray of Hope club which taught people to aim high have determination and be the best you could ever be .This inspired me that l could fit in some circumstances and maybe have a scholarship to continue my journey of success
09/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 016 6548: Studying at Marange High School provided a structured environment for learning and personal growth. It helped  me to develop important skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, time management, and communication.At school there were  opportunities for social interaction and building relationships with peers and teachers, which contributed  to my  personal development.

Participating in extracurricular activities such as sports, clubs, or community service also contributed to holistic growth by providing opportunities for leadership, teamwork, creativity, and personal interests outside of academics.

Conclusively  studying at Marange High School helped me a lot to become more well-rounded and prepared for the challenges of adulthood.
09/12/23, 2:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Great answers to both questions, This will help me to guide you better during the course of our Counselling!

I see you are interested in pursuing a course related to Law, Can you please explain in detail what motivates you to pursue this career field?
09/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 016 6548: There are several factors that motivated me  to pursue a career in international law. Some of these include:

1. l had interest in global issues such as human rights, environmental protection, and international conflict resolution.

2. The desire to make a difference: International law offers the opportunity to work on important and impactful issues that can have a real and lasting impact on the world.

3. The passion for justice:  l always wanted to promote social justice and fairness in the communities and societies  aided in  motivating me to pursue a career in international law in order to advocate for the rights of individuals and communities around the world.

4. Intellectual challenge: International law is complex and constantly evolving, which can be intellectually stimulating for those who enjoy grappling with difficult legal concepts and navigating the intricacies of international relations.

5.  The opportunities for travel and cultural exchange: International law often involves working with people from different countries and cultures, which can provide opportunities for travel, cultural exchange, and personal growth.

6. Potential for high-impact work: International lawyers have the potential to work on high-profile cases and issues that can have significant implications at both national and global levels.

Overally l was motivated by a desire to work on important global issues, make a positive impact on the world, and engage with diverse cultures
