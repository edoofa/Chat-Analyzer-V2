We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
17/11/23, 3:12 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program just in the last year.

22/11/23, 12:07 pm - Tushti: Now, you mentioned there are younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for the family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
22/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 249 2430: Anotida Marozva was born 25th December 2005. He did his primary education at Budiriro 5 Pry School then proceeded to Mufakose 1 High School for secondary education. He passed O Level with 5 subjects and proceeded to A Level at the same school. He's currently in L5 specialising in Literature in English, History and Divinity.  Anotida's father is a specialist teacher for children with special needs. He's got a Diploma in secondary education, Diploma in Special Needs Education and a Bachelor of Education degree in Sign Language. The mother is an entrepreneur.

22/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 249 2430: By the time Anotida would start his tertiary education it become more difficult to pay for the fees considering the rate of inflation and the meagre salaries civil servants get in Zimbabwe. It will be a huge mountain to climb

22/11/23, 2:06 pm - Tushti: Do you feel the family would be able to raise $2000 per year for the annual tuition fee?
