21/10/23, 11:47 am - +263 77 368 2556: Impressive
21/10/23, 11:52 am - Gurvinder: May I know if you understood everything properly?
21/10/23, 11:53 am - +263 77 368 2556: Yes I have understood
21/10/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
21/10/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 368 2556: No , we are not
21/10/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
21/10/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
21/10/23, 12:19 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
21/10/23, 12:41 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Okay I understand
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Gurvinder: To further Add on the Point 5th Mentioned above
 *Recommendation from Edoofa*

In simple words @263773682556 what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Ok
21/10/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 368 2556: That's wonderful
21/10/23, 12:57 pm - Gurvinder: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
21/10/23, 12:59 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Yes
21/10/23, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
21/10/23, 1:01 pm - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Very good
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
21/10/23, 1:03 pm - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
21/10/23, 1:04 pm - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit your child?*
21/10/23, 1:09 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Yes , very much
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

21/10/23, 1:14 pm - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your child's international education?
21/10/23, 1:20 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Ok
21/10/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 368 2556: It is indeed something I was hoping for my child
21/10/23, 1:23 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
21/10/23, 1:55 pm - Gurvinder: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on Monday at 9:30 AM. Please be online during your session time!

25/10/23, 10:45 am - Gurvinder: Flora, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
25/10/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 914 8683: Applying in 5 universities ranges between $1500-$2250
25/10/23, 11:11 am - Gurvinder: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
25/10/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 11:12 am - Gurvinder: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

It's been 16 years since the devastating genocide in Rwanda, and in that time, the country has made significant progress in rebuilding and recovering. There have been significant efforts to promote reconciliation and coexistence between the different ethnic groups, and the economy has also made progress. However, there are still challenges facing the country. Poverty is a major issue in Rwanda, with around 60% of the population living below the poverty line. In addition, health and education are still major challenges, the country has made significant progress, and there is hope for continued improvement in the future. One of the most remarkable things about Rwanda's recovery is the role that women played. The government has made a concerted effort to empower women, and as a result, the percentage of women in parliament is now one of the highest in the world. More, there has been a significant increase in the number of girls attending school. This has had a positive impact on the economy, as more women are now contributing to the workforce. Another notable development in Rwanda is the introduction of community based health care. This has improved access to health care for many people, and has been instrumental in reducing infact mortality.Overall,it is clear that Rwanda has come a long way since the genocide,and the country has much to be proud of. The  government has made significant progress in addressing the challenges facing the country, and the people of Rwanda are working hard to build a brighter future. While there is still work to be done, there is a reason to be optimistic about the future of the country.
27/10/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 914 8683: Section 6.                        Years back,I faced a lot of challenges. First it was school stuff. My parents had any money left in their bank accounts   for paying my school fees which was just raised from the amount we used to pay. The school head started to oust every student who had not payed the fees. I began to been ousted from school , the whole term ended while I was just sitting idle at home, waiting for things to become better. Goodness knows the best, a program which helped privileged children offered to help me and I went back to school. In few months a problem rose that only children without parents should be the only to be offered help. I began to being ousted from school again which created many tensions in our family but l kept having faith that all was going to be fine. I started studying at home and my father came to a conclusion that I should stop studying and dreaming of going back to school again. I was shattered and l could not stop studying only because of what my father said but l kept having hopes that one day i was going to be a doctor. My aunt offered to pay my school expenses up until l finish my ordinary level. I wrote my ordinary level exams and passes with flying colours. I was very happy but at some part very sad that my education was going to end there. A program which offered scholarships to students to students who passes helped me to carry on with my studies. The moral of the story is that no matter what you face in life , never give up on your dreams and always stay true to yourself.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program former students of St. David's Bonda which also happens to be our associate school, they are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

04/11/23, 10:52 am - +263 77 368 2556: Yes, we have
04/11/23, 11:04 am - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask regarding Tanatswa's letter?
04/11/23, 11:09 am - +263 77 368 2556: Everything was clear Sir, I have no questions
04/11/23, 11:16 am - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted, So what is the enrollment fee payment deadline mentoned in Tanatswa's  acceptance letter?
04/11/23, 11:29 am - +263 77 368 2556: 9 November
04/11/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please and are you aware of the transaction method's as well
04/11/23, 11:29 am - Shubham Madhwal: ?
04/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 368 2556: Yes it was mentioned in the letter as well
04/11/23, 12:09 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
04/11/23, 12:10 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Option 2
04/11/23, 12:12 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
04/11/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 368 2556: Yes I have spoken to Mr Shorwi
04/11/23, 12:20 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-

BANK NAME: FBC

BRANCH: Mutare

ACC NAME: Kawadza Shorwi

ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 0918 0214

CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 364 0738

04/11/23, 1:10 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Duly Noted Please
So are you clear with the process ahead?
04/11/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 368 2556: After payment of enrolment fees?

04/11/23, 1:32 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So  the program director would like to connect with  you over a video call session on Monday, May I know when will you be available for the same?
04/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 77 368 2556: 2:00 PM is fine
