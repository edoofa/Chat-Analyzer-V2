*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

23/10/23, 8:44 pm - +263 71 505 4041: we are  interested  in scholarship programme in india
23/10/23, 8:53 pm - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
23/10/23, 8:53 pm - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.* <This message was edited>

23/10/23, 8:55 pm - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:


*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
23/10/23, 9:00 pm - +263 71 505 4041: can you organise some full time scholarship for my boy and make all possible arrangements that can make life easy for hin during the course
23/10/23, 9:02 pm - Gurvinder: May I know what is your understanding of a full time scholarship?
23/10/23, 9:03 pm - +263 71 505 4041: the one that covers fees or tuition ,accomodation and some stipend am i right
23/10/23, 9:04 pm - Gurvinder: @263715054041, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

1. Scholarships
2. Sponsorships

Scholarships make education affordable for the students by reducing their Tuition Fees, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwe Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time
23/10/23, 11:21 pm - Gurvinder: Greetings Everyone

Tomorrow we celebrate *Dusherra*, which is a Hindu festival that celebrates the victory of good over evil. Hence we will connect for our session on Wednesday at 10:00 AM CAT.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage and that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.*

27/10/23, 11:06 am - +263 71 505 4041: ok i do
27/10/23, 11:20 am - Gurvinder: Well Please I would like you to be informed that the University evaluates the scholarship amount basis on the following points.

1. Academic 
2. Merit
3. Extra-Curricular Activities. 
4. Statement of purpose.
5. Recommendation from Edoofa.
27/10/23, 11:21 am - Gurvinder: To further Add on the Point 5th Mentioned above
 *Recommendation from Edoofa*

In simple words Fitzgerald, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well. However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/10/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 505 4041: brilliant
27/10/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 947 7813: That sounds like music to my ears.
27/10/23, 11:26 am - Gurvinder: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
27/10/23, 11:26 am - +263 71 947 7813: Please do sir
27/10/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
27/10/23, 11:28 am - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
27/10/23, 11:31 am - +263 71 947 7813: Okay. I get that part
27/10/23, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
27/10/23, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
* Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
* How to network like a boss - by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
* How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer - by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*
* It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship - by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje*
* Decoding the science of personal branding - by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
27/10/23, 11:32 am - Gurvinder: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
27/10/23, 11:39 am - +263 71 947 7813: I think this will be of a great deal because I have different people who are innovative and influencial at the same time who are with you all the way. And it is quite motivating. There is so much so much exposure which creates a unique experience and connecting to the world.
27/10/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
27/10/23, 11:54 am - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

27/10/23, 11:55 am - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
27/10/23, 11:58 am - +263 71 947 7813: There are so many of them and from my country.
27/10/23, 11:58 am - Gurvinder: Yes, Fitzgerald!
27/10/23, 12:00 pm - +263 71 947 7813: This is exactly what I need and its way more interesting in an unimaginable way
27/10/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: I am delighted to know that you have been looking for the same.
27/10/23, 12:01 pm - Gurvinder: Alright Fitzgerald, basically, now that we have discussed the financial aspect of the program quite in-depth, I believe your family members would be the ones who would be supporting you for your higher education.
27/10/23, 12:10 pm - +263 71 947 7813: Yes indeed
27/10/23, 12:13 pm - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.

Are you ready?
27/10/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I am ready
27/10/23, 12:17 pm - Gurvinder: @263719477813 as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
27/10/23, 12:20 pm - +263 71 947 7813: That would be $1500-$2250
27/10/23, 12:20 pm - Gurvinder: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
27/10/23, 12:21 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 12:22 pm - +263 71 947 7813: That is convenient
27/10/23, 12:24 pm - Gurvinder: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education.

Don’t you think so?
27/10/23, 12:26 pm - +263 71 947 7813: I do
27/10/23, 12:29 pm - Gurvinder: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
27/10/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: Now as you can see, because of such an amazing opportunity that Edoofa provides to its students, Edoofa receives thousands of applications on a  daily basis out of which Eligibility Evaluation takes place as I did share with you above, so only if the student is found eligible for the program and get their Acceptance Letter, *they will have to pay the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Acceptance Letter after which they start with their admission process and the Earn While You Learn Program.*
27/10/23, 12:30 pm - Gurvinder: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can *complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
27/10/23, 12:33 pm - +263 71 947 7813: That is a very nice offer
27/10/23, 12:34 pm - Gurvinder: I hope that you have understood how it totally depends upon the student to make his/her higher education affordable with the help of the Earn While You Learn Program's Scholarship Credits?
27/10/23, 12:35 pm - +263 71 947 7813: Yes I do sir.
27/10/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared
27/10/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
27/10/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
27/10/23, 12:36 pm - Gurvinder: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
27/10/23, 12:39 pm - +263 71 947 7813: Of course
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: So let me tell you that the next step After you are done interacting with the university you will receive your offer letter( UNIVERSITY ACCEPTANCE LETTER) from the university where your fee and scholarship will be mentioned and the university will give you a few week's time to make the payment of registration fee. Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. The first part will be paid in Coming few months of (2024-2025).
27/10/23, 12:44 pm - Gurvinder: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*
27/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 71 947 7813: Okay
27/10/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check
27/10/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
27/10/23, 12:49 pm - Gurvinder: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *on Monday at 12 PM CAT* Mr. Shubham would be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *I have also shared the Certificate of Incorporation of our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt.

30/10/23, 4:46 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Hey, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

SECTION 2 READING TEST

Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.
If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‘ gather resolution from despair’ but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare
d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

Section 5

Rwandan soil has been left with a great scar. Bad blood between  ethnic groups of the Bantu led to a genocide. Sixteen years later after the genocide the ethnic groups in rivalry have not been seeing eye to eye. The social structure of the communities has crumbled which has led to segregation. People of the same ethinic groups have gathered together to form their own communities. They do not to associate themselves with other ethnic groups whatsoever besides theirs. They sell and trade among themselves. This includes exchange of livestock, cloth and crops for other items such as soap, toiletries and utensils. These communities also have grocery stores and hardwares to provide for the community needs and help build infrastructure.To some extent this has kept peace among ethnic groups and the nation itself. But there is not much freedom as each member of a different Bantu group travels or runs errands in places that belong to his or her ethnic group. These groups have kept their distance from each other in building and expanding their settlements. The population in Rwanda has increased gradually in the last few years. New infrastructure have been created and  old settlements which were ruined during the genocide have been renewed. Cities have grown larger accommodating more businesses and educational facilities for higher education. In the city rivalry between ethnic groups has become dormant since law enforcement and the need for profits has taught individuals from different ethnic groups to  tolerate each other. The government has built schools for  communities of all ethnic group communities.  Agriculture has increased to feed the growing population and exporting goods to the outside world and neighbouring African countries. The government has been able to supress genocide through law enforcement and military patrols although genocide continues to a lesser extent in city outskirts.

Section 6 Personality Test

After three hours of being stuck in traffic I was finally lightened up by the smiles of the little orphans who had been anxiously waiting for the arrival of their cake to begin their party.

I had started off a fine day with a regular long walk around the neighbourhood. After a refreshing shower I got ready to hike at nearby mountain in Bejani and later sun gaze as I ravel in the sun. As I stepped out of my compound I bumped into my neighbour who apparently was headed in the same as I. With no delay she steeped into the car and we drove off together. We began conversating on the way and she told me she had a surprise she for somebody special she wanted to deliver. She surely sounded liki someone who had given much thought as to what exactly she would buy for this person. I wasn't surprised whenever she was exchanging words with me there rose a smile on her face as though she related that person to good memories.

I began to wonder who this mystery person was and to some degree was now eager to meet them.  Little did I know that my small wish would change the course of my planned  adventure. At this time we were only a few mintues away from her deatination. I began to search over for a good parking space. After she took her package I would find her a taxi and go on with my journey. I waited for her in the car as she found her way in the bakery.After a while I began to notice she was taking longer than I had anticipated. As I looked torwards the direction she headed off, there  appeared to be a small gathering at the exit in distress and in a state of emergency. I wondered what the fuss was all about so I decided to look it over and maybe find out what was taking my neighbour so long.

As I drew closer to the crowd I realised they were sorrounding someone who on the floor but something seemed familiar the attire they were wearing. It seemed similar to that of Mrs Tamira, my neighbour. The security guards were putting pressure at the back of her head with their jackets to stop the bleeding and helping her get comfortable as she lay on the floor. I galloped to her in utter confusion and fell on my knees to reach  closer to her. I asked what had happened and one of the guards explained to me that she slipped on her way out and fell on her head.

As I comforted her she whispered into my ear and handed me a piece of paper with an address on it. I had to finish her task for her but she did not realise her surprise now lay on the floor in dedri. In the process of tellimg her the setback I was interrupted by a gentleman who offered to assist her and paid for the cake now double the size.

As the transaction was cleared I thanked the man and bid farewell to Mrs Tamira who awaited for medical assistance only to find myself jammed in traffic with no way of turning the car around. The running car engines turning the atmosphere  into a living hell and the time getting slower. 

My mouth so dry and lips so chapped yearned for water which was nowhere near. I thirst as my as my tongue was stuck to my gullet. The loud car horns which woke me up from my short nap, an escape from torture indicated the road was now clear. I put my foot on the pedal hoping to catch up on the time lost. The address led me to the CZM orphanage and the two sisters at the chapel indicated they had long awaited for my arrival. In a haste I got the caje out of the car handing it over to sisters who welcomed me with a smile. Out of the blue  I was embraced by these tiny hands which reflected gratitude. They were the children Mrs Tamira had mentioned to me about and I began to feel the love and joy she felt for doing good.

They held my hands and dragged me to the party without asking who I was. Even I had forgotten my plans but the feeling from this experience was comparable to no other.

08/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 505 4041: yes we did.
08/11/23, 1:07 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So are there any questions you would like to ask?
08/11/23, 1:09 pm - +263 71 505 4041: i saw a range on the scholarship which range from 60-100% just wanted to know the percent that he got beside the range
08/11/23, 1:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: @263715054041 As you may recall from the counselling session, the counsellor informed you that the cost of education after the Edoofa Scholarship is approximately $2000-$3000. *However, with our special recommendation, as indicated, Fitzgerald was considered for a higher quantum of scholarship. Therefore, the effective annual fee after the scholarship would be even lower, in the range of ($1200-$800), as mentioned in the acceptance letter.*
This consideration was made primarily during the evaluation process, as I recognized Fitzgerald's potential. I firmly believe that if students like him/her are provided with the right resources at the right time in their careers, they have the potential to become great future leaders. Hence, I made a special recommendation to the Edoofa Academic Board.
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 71 505 4041: well understood
08/11/23, 1:59 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Are there any other questions you would like to ask? <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 505 4041: no that was the only question
08/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shubham Madhwal: So what is the enrollment fee payment  deadline mentioned in  Fitzgerald's acceptance letter?
08/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 71 505 4041: 13 november for the first 200 and 13 December foe 150 balance
08/11/23, 2:50 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Yes please, and are you aware of the transaction methods as well?
08/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 505 4041: yes through the bank or ex prncipal in Mutare with 12,5%
08/11/23, 3:03 pm - Shubham Madhwal: Alright so, if you have gone through your Letter of Acceptance thoroughly, you must have seen, that there are two modes of fee payments mentioned:-

1. Direct Bank Transfer to our Parent Company's account
2. Deposit in our associate's account over there in Zimbabwe

May I know which mode according to you would be convenient, so that I can brief you in-depth about that particular mode?
08/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 505 4041: im considering using bank to bank will visit the bank tomorrow to hear the requirements from bank vut im most likely to use my bank because i have visa card
08/11/23, 3:35 pm - Shubham Madhwal: You see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $80 to $100 which becomes quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $80 to $100 just as a transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr Shorwi's Account.

So as you can see in the letter there is a Bank deposit in, Mr Shorwi Ex-Principal of Hartzell High School's account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe
08/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 505 4041: ok thank you for that will do rhat with Mr Shorwi
08/11/23, 3:58 pm - Shubham Madhwal: The fee payment can also be made through Hartzell High. School Ex-Principal himself. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, *the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be 12.5% of the fees you are paying* the same details are as below:-
