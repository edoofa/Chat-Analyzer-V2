The Earn While You Learn Program is a project introduced by EDOOFA to help us students to get credits on  our own with the help of our project mentors to raise fees in order to cut the costs for our parents and guardians. We do all these tasks with the help of our mentors. These projects are very helpful to us students in the sense that,they helps us to develop the leadership skills like hardworking,punctuality,confidence and good communication skills, moreover each week we do online webinars with different motivational speakers,the webinars are very important to us as the stories shared are very inspiring. Our mentors are not only for the projects but they are also our guardians here as we are too far away from home.We share our problems with them and they always offer good solutions to us.l still remember last month l suffered from fever due to the change of environment,Edoofa managed to stand with me till l recovered.  These projects are done from the first year semester up until you finish your course. So while l was still in Zimbabwe l managed to do quite well in my projects and my credits are increasing.
460 - 05 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Ananya Edoofa: Goodafternoon Parents,coming back to my story‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.Studying abroad in lndia has some benefits, 1.You have an opportunity to meet new friends from different countries like Zambia,South Africa and Tanzania etc hence an advantage to learn new cultural practices and languages.As for me lam now connected to some students from lndia,Zambia and Cameroon and lam finding it helpful to me.The lndians are teaching me their language that is Hindi 2.Free internet connection is available in lndia,each day you get your 2GB data,you call for free at anytime you just feel like calling your local friends 3.The economy is very stable,goods and services are bought at a lower costs,all things are very cheap be it food,clothes,books and blankets etc 4.Water in lndia is for free there is no need to pay for it and it is always available ,you wash and bath as many times as you want,you won‚Äôt be charged 5.A chance also to explore new things,like the electric buses and trains ,,,visiting the Malls 6.lndia have the best Universities and hardworking members of the faculties ,no student is allowed to miss the classes,there is a rule in each University which says that each student must maintain 75% attendance and failure to do that will not be allowed to seat for the examinations and will be expelled from the school,hence it is a benefit as we are being taught to be hardworkers and to be always punctual,if a student is late for the lesson he or she will not be allowed to enter the classroom.As for me lam seeing that it is a very good thing as this doesn‚Äôt promote laziness but hardworkers and making us not to forget the purpose of leaving our country coming abroad.  So as an lnternational student lam really enjoying,lam staying outside the campus‚Ä¶‚Ä¶To get the accommodation l was helped by Edoofa and lam staying close to my university,no need for transport l just walk.Mr.Mukund the head of department from Edoofa is always at our school,he is our guardian,he is the one we tell all our problems anytime when we are at school.He is a hardworking man.

But there is no limit to how much you can finance yourself and my desire would be that you pay your entire fees through these credits but let me set a desirable goal that you can achieve in this span.  I would want you to have a look at the table and share your thoughts and ideas on how you feel we can achieve it.

259 - 06 Dec 2023 08:59AM - +260 97 7850766: Okay let me do it right now
260 - 06 Dec 2023 09:00AM - Ananya Edoofa: Great, we‚Äôve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let‚Äôs resolve them before we move on!
261 - 06 Dec 2023 09:01AM - +260 97 7850766: Okay I will thank you
262 - 06 Dec 2023 09:01AM - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I‚Äôll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project- 1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits 2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it‚Äôs an emergency 3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you‚Äôre good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
263 - 06 Dec 2023 09:02AM - +260 97 7850766: Okay I will do so
264 - 06 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey. FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions. Monday  and Thursday -  12:00 pm to 1:30 pm SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter. THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
265 - 06 Dec 2023 09:18AM - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170 Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line every day by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.  It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.  ""I am a Proud Edoofian"" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
266 - 06 Dec 2023 09:19AM - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:  'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

568 - 04 Dec 2023 05:35PM - +91 70272 86265: *Saturday activity*  Eversince the day I started doing EWYL I learnt many things. The things include communicate skills , soft skills , time management  and many more. I faced many challenges in the process like not finding students to share about the program during the community building program and school too.  I have learnt from my mistakes  and I have been working hard. I have   improved in communication  and I'm starting to work on my goals for future projects, setting goals for personal and academic development.  The main thing I learnt is to share information which is true and be frank all the time.   The main objective is to make a plan and then implement them. The project offers many opportunities like the chance to self finance ourselves and make students employable ready. I would like to connect with local organizations,  and influencial people so that I can gain knowledge from them.
569 - 06 Dec 2023 04:39AM - +91 70272 86265: Good morning. I am a proud Edoofian.

366 - 06 Dec 2023 03:57PM - +263 77 881 3471: This scholarship offer is misleading in that it is not a free scholarship. The recipient will be expected to work and recruit students (Zimbos) for the duration of their studies in India. The recipient will be pressured to meet a specific annual target of recruits.  Secondly, the institution to which the recipients will study, though registered and recognized by the Indian govt, the institutions are not respectable outside India. I am alive to students who failed to gain admission for post-grad studies because the first degree was not deemed to be from a credible institution.

147 - 06 Dec 2023 11:21AM - Saloni Edoofa: MoU stands for ""Memorandum of Understanding."" It is a formal agreement between two or more parties outlining their intention to work together on a particular project or towards a common goal. While an MoU is a formal document, it is typically less binding than a formal contract. It often serves as a preliminary step in the negotiation process and provides a framework for collaboration.

269 - 05 Dec 2023 10:36AM - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *""I am a proud Edoofian*.

217 - 05 Dec 2023 10:36AM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.  I believe it would be beneficial for your school to establish a connection with Edoofa. By doing so, you can ensure that students have access to a wider range of educational opportunities and experiences that extend beyond the boundaries of the local education system. Do you agree?
218 - 05 Dec 2023 11:17AM - Sharda Edoofa: Are you there in the session?
219 - 05 Dec 2023 02:13PM - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

221 - 06 Dec 2023 08:25AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Good morning Gugulethu* I hope you have had a great weekend.  You have a session scheduled today at *8:30 am*. Kindly confirm your availability for the same.
222 - 06 Dec 2023 08:32AM - Sharda Edoofa: *Let's kick things off with a motivational quote from the legendary Warren Buffett:* *""The best investment you can make is in yourself.""*  This quote underscores the profound importance of self-development and personal growth. Buffett emphasizes that the most valuable asset you possess is yourself. By investing time, effort, and resources in your education, skills, and well-being, you lay the foundation for future success.  So, let's use today's session as an opportunity to explore how we can invest in ourselves, hone our skills, and empower each other on the journey towards success. Remember, the dividends of self-investment are boundless!
223 - 06 Dec 2023 08:38AM - +263 78 982 1695: good morning, thanks for the quote
224 - 06 Dec 2023 08:43AM - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
225 - 06 Dec 2023 08:45AM - Sharda Edoofa: Since your school is currently not connected with Edoofa, an organization that offers the opportunity to study abroad and acquire a world-class education at an affordable price.

227 - 06 Dec 2023 08:48AM - Sharda Edoofa: Yes, Now our first task is to get the number of the School headmaster. There are plenty of ways to do so. You can reach out to your Headmaster at School with whom you were close and ask him/her for the School Head‚Äôs Contact. Even before that, you can ask your schoolmates peers, or neighbors if they have their School Head‚Äôs Contact.   Once you get the headmaster‚Äôs number, it is time for us to reach out to the school head in a professional manner. With poor communication, it's easy for messages to get misunderstood. By mastering the professional touch, the potential for misunderstandings occurring can be minimized.  The advantage here is that I will be helping you with every message that you share with your School Head. But in return, You have to promise that you will also understand the way these messages are framed so that you can use this skill later in your career. So are you ready?
228 - 06 Dec 2023 08:49AM - +263 78 982 1695: yes I am

I have been honored with the privilege of being selected for the Edoofa scholarship program. Through this incredible opportunity, I have been granted the chance to pursue my higher education in India, and what makes it even more remarkable is that this scholarship covers 50-100% of my educational expenses. I would greatly appreciate the chance to discuss this further with you. Could you please let me know when it would be convenient for you to connect via WhatsApp?

After forming the group they:  1) Either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them or 2) Ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa.

306 - 06 Dec 2023 06:06PM - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -  Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with Galgotias by paying your registration fee due.  If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.  If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias without risking losing out on the scholarship. <This message was edited>
307 - 06 Dec 2023 06:07PM - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well -  Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.  If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.  I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?

However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee.  This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?

99 - 05 Dec 2023 08:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -  *Step 1: Message from the founder‚Äôs office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa‚Äôs vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
100 - 05 Dec 2023 08:21PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you‚Äôve chosen that particular course and why you‚Äôre seeking admission in that particular school.  I hope these two steps are clear.

During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame.

Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.",No,No

110 - 06 Dec 2023 09:34AM - +263 77 623 2165: Good morning Mr Shivjeet how are you doing   What I have understood after watching the videos is that the student should follow instructions and listen to expert as well as the elevation of levels when the co-founder illustrated a cup and a tank holding different capacity of water. Also learnt that the co-founders play a parental role in ensuring students there get quality education by enrolling them in the best schools, colleges and universities. In the universities the Edoofa program provides EWYL in those universities ensuring that the student is able to master the concepts of being independent and hard worker which will later pay off when they attain their degree and there are different from the other students who did not do their internship through the EWYL program. That is what I have understood Mr Shivjeet.
111 - 06 Dec 2023 06:34PM - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!  I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual.  The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750.

52 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Arshita: Good to know about your knowledge
53 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
54 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Arshita: *1. It‚Äôs Home to the World‚Äôs Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
55 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there‚Äôs something for everyone in India‚Äôs massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
56 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - Arshita: *3. It‚Äô Affordable*- Compared to many of the world‚Äôs finest institutions, India‚Äôs low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
89 - 06 Dec 2023 05:16PM - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field. These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
90 - 06 Dec 2023 05:16PM - Arshita: * Webinars:* - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating?

93 - 06 Dec 2023 05:18PM - +263 71 483 9177: Yes I think I will benefit from this program
94 - 06 Dec 2023 06:15PM - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

192 - 06 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Arshita: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
193 - 06 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Arshita: At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure they develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your career, aren't you?

194 - 06 Dec 2023 04:41PM - +263 78 538 1851: Of course l'm looking forward  to have that opportunity
195 - 06 Dec 2023 05:06PM - Arshita: Good to know that!
196 - 06 Dec 2023 05:06PM - Arshita: So, before we move  to the Eligibility Procedures, can you tell me  1. What is the name of the course that you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?  2. In which country will you be studying through the Edoofa program?  3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?  4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?  5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program and in how many days is it paid if you are found eligible?  6. Please elaborate on your understanding of the Earn While You Learn program in 75-100 words.  7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
190 - 06 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Arshita: I do understand the challenges, did you manage to compare the cost of education in Zimbabwe with that through the Edoofa Scholarship Program?
191 - 06 Dec 2023 03:33PM - +263 78 538 1851: Not really l will compare but the difference is not that huge that's why l want to study abroad
192 - 06 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Arshita: Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.

77 - 06 Dec 2023 08:14AM - +260 772038434: I'm kindly requesting if you can please consider that
78 - 06 Dec 2023 08:36AM - Gurvinder: Berthel, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily, and since you did not had Physics and Chemistry individually that is why I gave you the best option that aligns with your passion and interest.
79 - 06 Dec 2023 08:41AM - +260 772038434: I would like to study medicine Mr Gurvinder to because that has been the on going dream so I'm asking if you can consider sir but maybe you can advise best but I would truly appreciate if I would be given a chance sir
80 - 06 Dec 2023 08:48AM - +260 772038434: For the results in my case science is a combination of Chemistry and Physics
81 - 06 Dec 2023 09:04AM - Gurvinder: Berthel, like I said doing Chemistry and Physics individually is mandate here in India, as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that I can't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:  *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  *2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .  *3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
82 - 06 Dec 2023 09:16AM - +260 772038434: Mr Gurvinder what would you advise then meaning I can't go for the course

79 - 06 Dec 2023 08:41AM - +260 772038434: I would like to study medicine Mr Gurvinder to because that has been the on going dream so I'm asking if you can consider sir but maybe you can advise best but I would truly appreciate if I would be given a chance sir
80 - 06 Dec 2023 08:48AM - +260 772038434: For the results in my case science is a combination of Chemistry and Physics
81 - 06 Dec 2023 09:04AM - Gurvinder: Berthel, like I said doing Chemistry and Physics individually is mandate here in India, as you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that I can't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:  *1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.  *2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .  *3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
82 - 06 Dec 2023 09:16AM - +260 772038434: Mr Gurvinder what would you advise then meaning I can't go for the course
83 - 06 Dec 2023 09:21AM - Gurvinder: yes, unfortunately that is correct.

67 - 06 Dec 2023 08:23AM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
68 - 06 Dec 2023 08:23AM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

30 - 05 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
31 - 05 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

106 - 06 Dec 2023 01:35PM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?

2 hr 4 mins","28 - 06 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Gurvinder: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees and accommodation. Edoofa has been in the Education space for more than a decade and one question that has always been on our table, and that we have been thinking about every year was *how to improve the quality of education for our candidates with affordability by providing employability skills*  One of the unique aspects of the program is the focus on the skill development of a student through the Earn While You Learn Program wherein a student receives real-time online projects, thereby gaining hands-on knowledge and experiences!
29 - 06 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Gurvinder: We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
30 - 06 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Gurvinder: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. *Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza*, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. *Hartzell High School*, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland *Sir Abson Mapfumo* is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. *United College of Education*, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected *Sir Adam Luthuli* has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of *Mrs. Aleta Makomeke*, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert‚Äôs, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
31 - 06 Dec 2023 10:40AM - Gurvinder: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
32 - 06 Dec 2023 11:00AM - +263 78 002 2176: Yes sir
33 - 06 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Gurvinder: Okay so Kersty, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship.
34 - 06 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Gurvinder: In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.
35 - 06 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Gurvinder: Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
36 - 06 Dec 2023 02:18PM - +263 78 002 2176: Yes i believe i have what it takes
37 - 06 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Gurvinder: That is great.

In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
59 - 06 Dec 2023 10:58AM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1.

31 mins","104 - 06 Dec 2023 10:50AM - +260 97 0229181: Sir, the reasons to why i want to study abroad is that because i want to improve my knowhow of certain things that are not provided in my country.  As you know that Zambia is one of the improving countries so, some certain facilities that can boost my learning skills are of inadequate supply so studying abroad can be of great help because i can have a chance  to learn new things and new cultures . like for the course i have chosen, my country does not offer more  improved learning skills but i feel i can  access better if i study abroad.
105 - 06 Dec 2023 10:52AM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
106 - 06 Dec 2023 11:11AM - +260 97 7629841: We are following the discussion
107 - 06 Dec 2023 11:15AM - +260 97 0229181: Well sir, if given the opportunity to study abroad and pursue the career pathway i will take it to hand that provision of tutorial services to the students is apprehended and by contributing the knowledge i have received from abroad through doing community sensitisation services to the people so that their knowledge is improved
108 - 06 Dec 2023 11:24AM - +260 97 0229181: Sorry sir but my aim on going abroad is not only for attaining maximum exposure in life but also for the best interest of others such as those in remote nations so that i can be able to help out with  their vision care through the funding of facilities like spectales and vision lenses to improve their eye sight . I also want to lessen on the expenses for my parents since i also have siblings that need the same care as i do .So applying for the program is a good way to start up with helping out on reducing my parents expenses.
109 - 06 Dec 2023 11:58AM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community an for the world Namwaka, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
110 - 06 Dec 2023 12:01PM - +260 97 0229181: Yes i do agree sir.
111 - 06 Dec 2023 12:05PM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
112 - 06 Dec 2023 12:06PM - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir .
113 - 06 Dec 2023 12:09PM - Gurvinder: You see Edoofa‚Äôs vision to provide every student with an education that is not just affordable but accessible and employable as well can only be achieved by utilizing the infrastructure of Indian Education landscape that has been developed over the last 75+ years since India‚Äôs Independence.
141 - 06 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
142 - 06 Dec 2023 12:45PM - Gurvinder: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*
143 - 06 Dec 2023 12:51PM - +260 97 0229181: Edoofa is really a good program sir.
144 - 06 Dec 2023 12:53PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Namwaka, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
145 - 06 Dec 2023 01:04PM - +260 97 0229181: Sir, is it that you start the earn while you learn program immediately you are inrolled into the university or maybe you do it after some time ?
146 - 06 Dec 2023 01:35PM - Gurvinder: When you get enrolled with Edoofa, after that you start with earn while you learn program.
147 - 06 Dec 2023 01:35PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
148 - 06 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +260 97 0229181: Yes sir .
149 - 06 Dec 2023 01:45PM - Gurvinder: Namwaka, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

230 - 06 Dec 2023 08:56AM - Gurvinder: Juliet, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*",No,Yes

121 - 06 Dec 2023 09:33AM - Gurvinder: The course that I have offer you teaches computer programing that is in align with Mwaka's interest and also offers similar job opportunities.

161 - 06 Dec 2023 11:07AM - +260 97 8806769: Mr Gurvinder one cardinal fact we left out. Mwaka has an older sibling who will begin pursuing accounting studies at the Zambia centre for accountancy studies. This should've been in Mwakas introduction
162 - 06 Dec 2023 11:10AM - +260 97 8806769: And morals are somewhat still upheld even with escalating levels of technology and in the face of moral decay. Not that it's spared from what happens everywhere else in the world. That's the other reason I would opt for India
163 - 06 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: Noted.
164 - 06 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: That is great.
165 - 06 Dec 2023 11:56AM - Gurvinder: So now Mwaka, I hope you must have understood the quality of higher education that Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead. As of now would you like to ask anything so far?
166 - 06 Dec 2023 12:01PM - +260 97 5285124: So far, i dont have any questions. Thankyou for outlining all these details to meüôè
167 - 06 Dec 2023 12:06PM - Gurvinder: So now moving ahead by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India?
180 - 06 Dec 2023 12:42PM - +260 97 8806769: Ok it's very clear. Thanks
181 - 06 Dec 2023 12:46PM - Gurvinder: So now shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?
182 - 06 Dec 2023 12:48PM - +260 97 5285124: Yes pleaseüôè
183 - 06 Dec 2023 12:49PM - Gurvinder: Mwaka, The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash.

Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
184 - 06 Dec 2023 12:55PM - +260 97 5285124: So does that mean that all international students get to be part of the EWYL program?
185 - 06 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: Yes that is correct.
186 - 06 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.  *1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*  The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:  -_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0  -_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
187 - 06 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: *2. Recruitment Partners: -*  Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- -Nigenuis -Skooqs -Success Magazine -TIA Organics
188 - 06 Dec 2023 01:20PM - Gurvinder: *3. Webinars: -*  We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - _Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*. _How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi* _How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu* _It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship_ by *Mr. Ronard Kachaje* _Decoding the science of personal branding_ by *Mr, Simon Maingi*
189 - 06 Dec 2023 01:21PM - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
216 - 06 Dec 2023 03:35PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?
217 - 06 Dec 2023 03:49PM - +260 97 5285124: Yes, it actually is
218 - 06 Dec 2023 03:50PM - Gurvinder: Mwaka, by now, I hope you have understood that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is not merely a platform for students to gain admission to an internationally recognized university. It offers much more. Among various differentiators, the value provided by Edoofa to a particular student surpasses that offered by any admission agent or consultant.

220 - 06 Dec 2023 04:09PM - +260 97 5285124: Yeah, personally i think edoofa is a really good program and i would like to be part of it

128 - 06 Dec 2023 11:00AM - Gurvinder: Yes, but the quantam of scholarship depends on your counselling session, your eligibility tests, and your interviews.
129 - 06 Dec 2023 11:03AM - +260 97 8447239: Okay noted
130 - 06 Dec 2023 11:03AM - +260 97 8447239: Do you also pay for the plane ticket?

133 - 06 Dec 2023 12:29PM - Gurvinder: In simple words Nchimunya what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well.  However as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her counselling, eligibility check stage and is thorough throughout the evaluation, then they surely are rewarded with higher quantum of scholarship after which the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, now this , and even *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
134 - 06 Dec 2023 12:30PM - +260 97 8447239: Hmmm very interesting is there more to it?

Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way inorder to transform your career dear?
67 - 06 Dec 2023 08:25AM - +263 78 873 4584: yes l am willing
68 - 06 Dec 2023 08:41AM - Gurvinder: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
69 - 06 Dec 2023 08:51AM - +263 78 873 4584: l want to study abroad because studying in a different country can help open up new doors and networks that may not be available at home.The universities this side are quite expensive and there's something exciting about the idea of living and learning in a new place, surrounded by new people and new experiences.
70 - 06 Dec 2023 09:09AM - Gurvinder: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.  In that case, now I would like you to tell, that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?
71 - 06 Dec 2023 09:14AM - +263 78 873 4584: I would want to use my experience and knowledge to help improve the education system in my home country. I would do this by sharing what I have learnt with other students and educators, as well as by advocating for educational reforms that could help make the system more effective. For example, I might share my experience with international accreditation standards, which could help to improve the quality of education in my home country and  I would seek to build connections between my home country and the country I study in, to create opportunities for students to learn from each other.
72 - 06 Dec 2023 09:19AM - Gurvinder: I appreciate your sense of hardworking for your community Takudzwa, but in order to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and in order to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you.  Don‚Äôt you agree?
73 - 06 Dec 2023 09:20AM - +263 78 873 4584: l agree
74 - 06 Dec 2023 09:22AM - Gurvinder: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.  I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn‚Äôt it?
146 - 06 Dec 2023 10:50AM - +263 78 873 4584: yess l have
147 - 06 Dec 2023 10:52AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
148 - 06 Dec 2023 10:55AM - +263 78 873 4584: yes l am
149 - 06 Dec 2023 10:58AM - Gurvinder: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
150 - 06 Dec 2023 10:58AM - +263 78 873 4584: yes
151 - 06 Dec 2023 11:52AM - Gurvinder: Takudzwa, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.  *Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
152 - 06 Dec 2023 11:56AM - +263 78 873 4584: $1500 -$2250
153 - 06 Dec 2023 11:57AM - Gurvinder: Exactly Takudzwa, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

178 - 06 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

65 - 06 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!

50 - 06 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Harmehak: Alright please Nyasha
51 - 06 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
52 - 06 Dec 2023 11:55AM - +263 71 210 3812: Yeah i am confident
53 - 06 Dec 2023 11:59AM - Harmehak: That's great

59 - 06 Dec 2023 01:00PM - Harmehak: So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially please?
60 - 06 Dec 2023 01:02PM - +263 78 591 8462: Yes .my family members are aware ,and I think my mother is willing to support in any way
61 - 06 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Harmehak: That's great.
62 - 06 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
63 - 06 Dec 2023 01:23PM - +263 78 591 8462: I am confident that's I will get good points
64 - 06 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Harmehak: That's great
65 - 06 Dec 2023 01:34PM - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study medicine ?
73 - 06 Dec 2023 03:31PM - Harmehak: Alright please, Tanaka  So did you ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine too?
74 - 06 Dec 2023 03:33PM - +263 78 591 8462: I have not yet researched
75 - 06 Dec 2023 03:34PM - Harmehak: Alright please
76 - 06 Dec 2023 03:34PM - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
77 - 06 Dec 2023 03:35PM - +263 78 591 8462: Alright. So how well should you do in these subjects
78 - 06 Dec 2023 03:52PM - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are  1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*  2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*  3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*  4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*  5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*  6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*  7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*
79 - 06 Dec 2023 04:39PM - Harmehak: I was expecting your response however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.  *Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026).

150 - 06 Dec 2023 11:49AM - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.   *Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.   *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).   *Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
151 - 06 Dec 2023 11:50AM - +263 71 531 6384: So the $350 is paid after admission or before
152 - 06 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Pallika Edoofa: Mercy, The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, that is after today's session when your application will proceed towards the eligibility test and interview.

Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.   We are left with 5 and 6.

(The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
160 - 06 Dec 2023 12:15PM - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa.

I hope you are clear with the process.

To give a glimpse, we have a community of more than 2500 Zimbabweans with  300+ associate schools from Zimbabwe with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, and parents, who have been bringing success stories of Edoofians for the past 14+ years due to the kind of foster and care that we provide throughout their course!  With UGC-approved Universities whose degrees are Globally accredited, and which have all security and healthcare facilities including counselling departments, Edoofians are exposed to a conducive environment that motivates them to focus on their career and achieve their dreams. There are Zimbabwean Communities at Every University so no child will feel lonely. Moreover, our Admission Team, EWYL(Earn While You Learn) mentor and counsellor of a student will be available to him/her throughout the course. At any point, if the student or parent needs assistance we will be readily accessible. This is the reason why Edoofa is known as a *Higher Education Concierge!*  The Universities are strict in terms of the welfare of children. Being in Zimbabwe itself, your parents will be able to track the happenings, academic performance, and University details

64 - 06 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this, Ms. Francisca, I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

137 - 06 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Ms. Francisca, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your *-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* *-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* *-Earn While You Learn Program and training* *-University sessions and interactions* *-A guaranteed scholarship seat* *-Visa Documentation Assistance* *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
138 - 06 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
139 - 06 Dec 2023 03:51PM - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.   *Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.   *Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).   *Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.   *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

I like geography and mechanics hence  my career goals once clashed as I had to choose whether to go for a mining degree or mechanical engineering degree but I had to choose the latter. I had my o'level at Budiriro B College in gweru mkoba which is situated in the midlands province and came out with 5A's 3B's and a C. I went on to do my A'level with a combination of Physics Mathematics and Geography at Mkoba High school and come out with 5 points. My school fees per term was   $90. My mother is the breadwinner, she works at a parking company called gweru city parking and she's the one will help out with my higher education abroad.

153 - 06 Dec 2023 12:22PM - Pallika Edoofa: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*    Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

160 - 06 Dec 2023 03:05PM - Pallika Edoofa: Winslet, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.",No,No

191 - 06 Dec 2023 07:32AM - +263 78 143 5949: On that one , I think  it will benefit a student to get a job very fast , since all organisations take experience as an advantage during recruitment.

194 - 06 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: So now , if I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.
195 - 06 Dec 2023 01:11PM - Sahil Edoofa: _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_  Now you see , the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
196 - 06 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

197 - 06 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is *consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects* is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

208 - 06 Dec 2023 01:12PM - Sahil Edoofa: You can see this even in the above-shared scholarship credit certificates where our star performers, our *Proud Edoofians* like Miriam earned *$2618* within a time span of a year. Well, this was only possible for them to earn a handsome amount of scholarship credits because they were constantly in touch with their mentors for their skill development, and repeatedly asked for more projects and assignments to be done, which in return helped her to earn such an amount of scholarship credits in a year.  I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure of your parents?
209 - 06 Dec 2023 01:53PM - +263 78 143 5949: I can understand how EWYL program help to cover tuition fees, accommodation, food ,etc
210 - 06 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Sahil Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling : 1.     *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2.     *Employability through practical training*‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
211 - 06 Dec 2023 03:23PM - Sahil Edoofa: 3.     *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.   4.     *Higher Education Concierge*‚Äã: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education. --  So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
212 - 06 Dec 2023 04:03PM - +263 78 143 5949: I prefer employability through practical training, because will be applying what are learning,  in a real life situation which happens to be maybe difficult but will make it easier for us in the long run",No,Yes

305 - 06 Dec 2023 11:02AM - Sahil Edoofa: Good morning How are you doing today?
306 - 06 Dec 2023 11:06AM - +263 78 235 4301: I'm good how are you
307 - 06 Dec 2023 11:53AM - Sahil Edoofa: Noted
308 - 06 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
309 - 06 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
310 - 06 Dec 2023 11:54AM - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

304 - 06 Dec 2023 02:29PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
305 - 06 Dec 2023 02:29PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him. Since his account is a NOSTRO Account which only holds USD itself, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $394 ($350 + $44 transfer charges), and the same details are as below:-  BANK NAME: FBC  SWIFT CODE: FBCPZWHA  ACC NAME: CHARLES JERERA  ACC NUMBER: 5333 0380 1404 8828  CONTACT NUMBER: +263 77 376 9854

301 - 05 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +27 65 247 1972: The multi step process is advantageous in that it buys you time to prepare for university and also probably secure assistance in funding
302 - 05 Dec 2023 02:20PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ryan's admission is for August 2025 Intake. Let me share with you for all the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake. Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.

509 - 06 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.
510 - 06 Dec 2023 02:47PM - Sahil Edoofa: Therefore the fee can also be paid through him.

364 - 06 Dec 2023 01:44PM - Sahil Edoofa: you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $35 to $50 which is quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zambia itself. Due to this not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $35 to $50 just as transfer charge.  The second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in our associate Mr. Hammond and Mrs. Penelope's organization Penmal Connect's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Penmal Connect's account as you see he is our Associate in Zambia, His contribution has been immense because of which students like Muchimba are able to pursue their education in India.  The fee payment can also be made through them. Since they have two accounts one is a USD account and the other is the Zambian Kwacha Account, therefore the necessary amount including the transfer charges in this mode itself would be $368 ($350 + $18 transfer charges) or equivalent Zambian Kwacha, and the same details are as below:-  US Dollar Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003806 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia  Zambian Kwacha Account Bank Name: FNB Branch: Acacia Branch Account Name: Penmal Connect Ltd Account Number: 62878003731 Swift Code: FIRNZMLX Sort Code: 2600001 Contact Number: +260972651616, +260978789429 Address: 8 Chibote Avenue, Parklands, Kitwe, Copperbelt Province, Zambia
365 - 06 Dec 2023 01:50PM - +260 96 2284130: Oh ok. Thanks.  Yes we used the Penmal kwacha account.  But we have not included the 5%. How do you  advise we do it? Do we add it to the $150 bal to be paid before 11th January?
366 - 06 Dec 2023 03:18PM - Sahil Edoofa: You can pay that with remaining part next month

282 - 06 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
283 - 06 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

286 - 06 Dec 2023 01:49PM - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates: 1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 12th  or 13th December 2023 for $200 and the 12th  or 13th of January  for the remaining $150. 2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 12th  or 13th December 2023.

354 - 06 Dec 2023 09:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
355 - 06 Dec 2023 09:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

63 - 06 Dec 2023 09:13AM - +263 71 962 3537: It is an important subject but with the path I want to take it's not as important because what's really necessary if you are to do engineering is Maths and Physics.
64 - 06 Dec 2023 09:28AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, if you had researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any *Healthcare course* in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study *Mechanical Engineering* / *Civil Engineering* then they should have *Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics* in their A level mandatorily.

However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

293 - 06 Dec 2023 12:16PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

284 - 06 Dec 2023 08:51AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,  *""Believe in the magic within you, for that's where dreams come to life."" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe*  On a positive note, I am here to begin our session Are you ready?
285 - 06 Dec 2023 09:39AM - +263 71 878 3872: Mrng hwu sir
286 - 06 Dec 2023 10:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am doing fine, Kimberly. Thank you for asking. I hope you are having a wonderful day as well!
287 - 06 Dec 2023 10:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
288 - 06 Dec 2023 10:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
289 - 06 Dec 2023 10:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
290 - 06 Dec 2023 10:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

311 - 06 Dec 2023 10:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you can now realize how you can use the EWYL program to earn scholarship credits to reduce the financial pressure on your parents?
312 - 06 Dec 2023 12:37PM - +263 71 878 3872: You are welcome sir, my day is still good
313 - 06 Dec 2023 12:40PM - +263 71 878 3872: Yes l can see that
314 - 06 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
315 - 06 Dec 2023 12:59PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

173 - 06 Dec 2023 07:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
176 - 06 Dec 2023 09:20PM - +263 71 434 8309: There is a bit different since a student who have access to a scholarship have the room to attain better standards as compared to the one who doesn't have access to a scholarship
177 - 06 Dec 2023 09:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Naume! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

184 - 06 Dec 2023 09:48PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Naume. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
185 - 06 Dec 2023 09:49PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

256 - 06 Dec 2023 08:52AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
257 - 06 Dec 2023 08:53AM - +267 77 498 194: Yes I am having a wonderful day thank you
266 - 06 Dec 2023 09:18AM - +267 77 498 194: With the fees being lower there . The edoofa program will assist in paying from about 50 percent going up of the fees . This depends on the percentage of your scholarship
267 - 06 Dec 2023 09:19AM - +267 77 498 194: The Edoofa program covers the application form and statement of purpose for the enrolled student and it also covers the Visa documentation assistance

269 - 06 Dec 2023 09:24AM - +267 77 498 194: The Earn while you learn (EWYL) program . This is when students do certain tasks so that you gain scholarship credits that can help you pay for your own finances on your own . This program doesn't bring out some income only but it also builds the skill set for the students
270 - 06 Dec 2023 09:25AM - +267 77 498 194: This is what l have understood about the Edoofa program in terms of finances
271 - 06 Dec 2023 09:45AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.

She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.  Have a look at her daughter's video as well.

I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!",No,No

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
212 - 05 Dec 2023 09:51PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

223 - 06 Dec 2023 11:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I can conclude that you are diligent and possess extreme valor. You will surely prove your mettle if provided with the right path. Moreover, Edoofa is a big family, and I can assure you that you will never feel like an outcast or out of place! Furthermore, Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
224 - 06 Dec 2023 11:17AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Moreover, As *Edoofa* we also prioritize a student's security! That is the reason we are the most trusted organization in Africa with a community of more than 4000 students! Furthermore, after the session, I will connect you with a few of the students who are currently studying in India with us, so that you and your parents can connect with them!
225 - 06 Dec 2023 11:59AM - +263 78 635 0533: Your  words are so kind and encouraging ,it's great to hear that Edoofa prioritizes a sense of community and belonging for its student's ,I'm so glad to hear that studying abroad can have such a positive impact on my career and my family's well-being.

229 - 06 Dec 2023 01:08PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
230 - 06 Dec 2023 02:44PM - +263 78 635 0533: Yes 1) Application Form 2) Statement of purpose 3) Letter of recommendation 4)Any other required documents, such as proof of residency 5)Police clearance certificate <This message was edited>
231 - 06 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
232 - 06 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.

234 - 06 Dec 2023 02:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your  - *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team* - *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities* - *Earn While You Learn Program and training* - *University sessions and interactions* - *A guaranteed scholarship seat* - *Visa Documentation Assistance* - *The Foster and Care throughout your course*
235 - 06 Dec 2023 03:12PM - +263 78 635 0533: Thank you sir for the information ,I really appreciate the time and effort you put into gathering this information for me. It's very helpful and much appreciated.
236 - 06 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
237 - 06 Dec 2023 03:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
238 - 06 Dec 2023 04:13PM - +263 77 447 8908: I'm so greatful for the flexible fee option
239 - 06 Dec 2023 04:22PM - +263 78 635 0533: I'm happy to know that each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out .
240 - 06 Dec 2023 04:31PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
238 - 06 Dec 2023 04:13PM - +263 77 447 8908: I'm so greatful for the flexible fee option

241 - 06 Dec 2023 06:34PM - +263 78 635 0533: I understand that the financial aspect of the program is very important to consider. It's great to know that Edoofa is helping students figure out how to manage their finances and make payments on their own. I especially appreciate the transparency and clarity that you've provided about the program's fees and payment options. It's a relief to know that everything is laid out in a straightforward way.
242 - 06 Dec 2023 06:38PM - +263 78 635 0533: I understood that the  (EWYL) program is a way for students to earn credits that can be applied towards their education fees, this is a very unique and helpful program, as it gives students the opportunity to offset the cost of their education while gaining valuable work experience.
243 - 06 Dec 2023 07:58PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Let me summarize the financial aspects for you.  *Enrollment fee* The enrollment fee is $350 out of which you need to pay only $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 is to be paid in next 30 days  For all the services and assistance including Applications, SOP, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, and sessions, etc all you need to pay is $350  *Cost of education* The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc! If you are found eligible for a higher quantum of scholarship, the cost of education will be reduced to $1600-$2300 per annum  This cost can be further reduced through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program.
244 - 06 Dec 2023 08:14PM - +263 78 635 0533: Okay , Thank you Noted

247 - 06 Dec 2023 08:37PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, we are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?",No,Yes

217 - 06 Dec 2023 04:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
218 - 06 Dec 2023 10:25PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
219 - 06 Dec 2023 10:27PM - +263 77 741 8328: Yes you can explain them
220 - 06 Dec 2023 10:32PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.  *August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
176 - 05 Dec 2023 09:41PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?

And i can also see that this program will actually help to be a well trained student after graduating which will make it easy for me to survive in the outside world because i will be knowing a lot of things  And i will also be able to survive even if i don't get the job  which i have studied for

211 - 06 Dec 2023 01:00PM - +263 78 596 6416: Woooow this would be definitely affordable for my family
212 - 06 Dec 2023 01:04PM - +263 78 596 6416: Yeah i really understand thank you Sir
213 - 06 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
214 - 06 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
215 - 06 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
216 - 06 Dec 2023 02:19PM - +263 78 596 6416: Ooooh i think i appreciate all of them because they are all brilliant but what appreciate the most is  affordability through guaranteed scholarships
217 - 06 Dec 2023 02:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?

217 - 06 Dec 2023 02:28PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand that your emphasis is on affordability. So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
218 - 06 Dec 2023 02:37PM - +263 78 596 6416: They feel great about it.They will be proud of me if i get a chance to study abroad
219 - 06 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
220 - 06 Dec 2023 02:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
221 - 06 Dec 2023 03:01PM - +263 78 596 6416: Yes Sir i think you are right,all these things are necessary when a student plans to apply abroad
222 - 06 Dec 2023 03:09PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
223 - 06 Dec 2023 03:09PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
226 - 06 Dec 2023 03:17PM - +263 78 596 6416: Ummm this could expensive and unsure since there is no guarantee if you are going to be enrolled or not
227 - 06 Dec 2023 03:19PM - +263 78 596 6416: Woow you are doing a great job by helping with all that amount of money,i just i could get the chance to be helped too
228 - 06 Dec 2023 03:22PM - +263 78 596 6416: Oooh okay
229 - 06 Dec 2023 03:23PM - +263 78 596 6416: This is much better
230 - 06 Dec 2023 03:24PM - +263 78 596 6416: Because there will be a guaranteed scholarship seat
231 - 06 Dec 2023 04:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.  *Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program. *Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out). *Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. *The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
232 - 06 Dec 2023 04:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
233 - 06 Dec 2023 04:33PM - +263 78 596 6416: Okay Sir i understand
234 - 06 Dec 2023 04:33PM - +263 78 596 6416: So how many points are actually expected by you ,which are suitable for enrollment
235 - 06 Dec 2023 04:34PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
232 - 06 Dec 2023 04:17PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.

236 - 06 Dec 2023 04:36PM - +263 78 596 6416: Yes im truly confidence about achieving more than 2 Alevel passes
237 - 06 Dec 2023 04:53PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Ruvarashe!
238 - 06 Dec 2023 04:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So now as we have discussed about the payment policy of the Enrollment fee and other finances of the program as well, so can you share with me what all did you understand about the financial aspects of the program and how Edoofa helps a student arrange and pay his/her finances by themselves?
239 - 06 Dec 2023 05:00PM - +263 78 596 6416: I believe that too
240 - 06 Dec 2023 05:11PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Can you please acknowledge this message?
241 - 06 Dec 2023 05:21PM - +263 78 596 6416: Okay so far i have understood that Edoofa offer 50-100% scholarships and if one get a chance to attain a 100% he or she will be only paying an amount of $1200-$1800  and There can be an advantage of the Earn While You Learn program which is offered by Edoofa and ,the students will be working and receive salaries which can help them to reduce the burden of paying fees.  Moreover for one to be enrolled there is need for Application form, Recommendation letter and statement of purpose and these may cost up to 1750 but with Edoofa students only has to pay an amount which adds up to 350 and this amount also caters for visa documentation, University, Seels Learning Center classes and everything  So Edoofa helps students to arrange and pay finances by themselves through the EWYL program  in which students will be participating in and performing projects and assignments and earning for that

245 - 06 Dec 2023 06:19PM - +263 78 596 6416: I think we have discussed all the stages and i think i am on stage 1,this is what i think i don't know if I'm correct
246 - 06 Dec 2023 06:29PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Bravo! We are at stage one but we have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.  *Step 1: Connect with a counselor* - As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.  *Step 2: Eligibility Check* - The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and Test.  *Step 3: Acceptance Letter from Edoofa* - If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!  *Step 4: Enrollment into the Edoofa Program* - This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.  We are left with 5 and 6. So shall I explain it to you?
247 - 06 Dec 2023 09:34PM - +263 78 596 6416: Yes Sir
248 - 06 Dec 2023 10:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Step 5: After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors , they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.  This registration fee($500-$1000) isn‚Äôt an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year‚Äôs Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).  Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment($500-$1000) will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.  I hope you are clear with the process?

153 - 06 Dec 2023 10:47AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tabeth! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment?

Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?

However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
168 - 06 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.  The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
169 - 06 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
170 - 06 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
171 - 06 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
172 - 06 Dec 2023 02:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
173 - 06 Dec 2023 06:10PM - +263 78 722 3054: It is beneficial because l will gain income which may satisfy my needs and wants
174 - 06 Dec 2023 06:10PM - +263 78 722 3054: Thank you for the exposure
175 - 06 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
176 - 06 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
177 - 06 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
178 - 06 Dec 2023 07:55PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

214 - 06 Dec 2023 09:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
215 - 06 Dec 2023 09:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
216 - 06 Dec 2023 09:23PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
217 - 06 Dec 2023 09:36PM - +263 78 722 3054: Point three and four

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for your child?
185 - 05 Dec 2023 08:21PM - +263 77 298 9303: Thank you. Allow us time to go through the information comprehensively
186 - 05 Dec 2023 08:22PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Certainly, Mrs. Charity. I will be waiting for your response.

196 - 06 Dec 2023 10:55AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mrs. Charity. I trust you are well acquainted with the significance of tertiary education, a pivotal juncture in a student's academic journey demanding utmost dedication. It's crucial to note that Edoofa operates on a merit-based scholarship program, employing rigorous criteria rooted in academic excellence. Given the substantial influx of daily applications, our scheduling adheres to a meticulous process, with each student allocated a designated time slot. Recognizing your professional commitments, I kindly inquire about your preferred timings to facilitate a seamless and convenient counseling session, please?

If you want to discuss anything else apart from what you shared yesterday evening we can go ahead
198 - 06 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month

199 - 06 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
200 - 06 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

273 - 06 Dec 2023 10:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.

274 - 06 Dec 2023 10:03PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
275 - 06 Dec 2023 10:04PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India  I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.

25 - 06 Dec 2023 09:08PM - +263 77 857 3350: I'm I'm tendai jembere's father and husband to S Angelina Makoni. We are a small educated family. We have three kids. Jesca Jembere, courage Jembere and tendai jembere. My wife, she is a professional teacher, teaching at primary Level. My first born she is a nurse here in Zimbabwe and my son is also a teacher. Teaching is like genetics within our family, I'm also a teacher. However the economic situation on our country is not favorable so we are financial constrained but we have been trying for tendai and we managed to pay for her secondary level and she passed both O and  A level studies  Tendai is a hard working girl a well behaved daughter. She strive by all means to succeed in life and she made us proud when she passed here o and A level studies. With this opportunity coming we are more than happy, she is showing that she can't give up on her academic journey  even tho we are financially crippled. Again as the father I'm not giving up on her we will push harder for tendai to achieve her goals  Tendai she is a kind hearted person, who is value free she can accommodate everyone and she always do good to others.  Like everyone she got her weaknesses, she works too hard to achieve her goals she can't rest if she wants to achieve something. I concidered that as a weakness. However all in all I see her as a very strong women... and she will prosper and never disappoint us
26 - 06 Dec 2023 09:25PM - +263 77 857 3350: I have a diploma in education together with my wife. Our whole life we have been teaching. So education is of great importance in our family,  and it was easy for us to groom our children. We encouraged them to focus more on education.  I think tendai started to develop interest in agriculture long back probably because we live in rural area where agriculture is the only basic area which gives us money and food. Therefore to her learning and studying agriculture will help her and the community to utilise the land and commercializing agriculture for the betterment of everyone  and it helped here to choose agriculture at A level and now willing to do it at university level.

I did my  secondary education at St Faith High school from from 2017 to 2020 and managed to score the following subjects: Agriculture B Combined Science C Maths C English A Heritage Studies A Shona B Geography A Physics C Biology C History A Commerce A Economics C Principles of Accounting A Statistics B. I then did my Advanced level at First Class Academy in Mutare from 2021 to 2022 and l wrote both Cambridge and Zimsec . I have did four subjects at Zimsec and got the following results: Maths A Accounts A Economics A Statistics A. Then l did three subjects at Cambridge and obtained the following results: Maths A Accounts A Economics A. I have put a lot of effort during the course of my studies because my wish is to do Acturial Science . I have a lot of interests in Acturial Science. I like watching football . My father is a Pastor of the United Methodist Church and my mother is a teacher by profession teaching at Sagambe High School.  If l look at the income capacity of my parents , it's at the lowest ebb. Catering for my fees at one the best Universities so as to pursue for my career seemed to be a burden to them. Apart from that l have my young brother Vimbainashe Emmanuel Tendengu who will be doing form four next year 2024 at First Clast Academy so my parents have mounting pressures of these fees in my family.  That's why l have found interest in Edoofa Scholarships such that my dream will be fulfilled here.  I am in need of help so that l will pursue with my studies and do Acturial Science.
