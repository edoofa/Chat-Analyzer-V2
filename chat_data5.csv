247 - 16 Dec 2023 08:15PM - +263 78 896 1515: Greetings everyone! My story is based on a street kid named Nhamoinesu .   Once upon a time in the bustling city of Harare , there lived a young boy named Nhamo. Nhamo was a street kid, born and raised on the unforgiving streets of the city. Despite his difficult circumstances, Nhamo possessed a heart full of determination and a spirit that refused to be broken.  Every day, Nhamo woke up with the rising sun, ready to face the challenges that lay ahead. He would scavenge for scraps of food, relying on his quick wit and nimble fingers to find his next meal. Nhamo knew the value of hard work, and he never shied away from any opportunity to make an honest living.  One fateful day, as Nhamo was rummaging through a garbage dump, he stumbled upon a worn-out leather jacket. Intrigued by its mysterious allure, Nhamo decided to investigate further. To his surprise, hidden inside one of the jacket's pockets was a crumpled piece of paper. It was a map‚Äîa map that promised untold riches buried deep within the heart of the city.  Driven by a newfound sense of hope, Nhamo set out on an adventure like no other. He followed the map's intricate paths, navigating through the bustling streets, dark alleys, and hidden corners of the city. Along the way, he encountered various obstacles and met a cast of colorful characters, each with their own stories of struggle and perseverance.  As Nhamo delved deeper into the heart of the city, he discovered that the treasure the map led him to wasn't material wealth, but something far more valuable‚Äîfriendship, love, and a sense of belonging. Through his encounters, Nhamo learned the power of compassion, empathy, and the importance of standing up for what is right.  With every step he took, Nhamo's reputation as a street kid changed. People began to recognize his integrity, his diligence, and his unwavering honesty. Nhamo's journey not only transformed his own life, but it also inspired those around him to reevaluate their own values and priorities.  In the end, Nhamo's journey led him back to where he started‚Äîthe streets of Harare. But this time, he wasn't alone. Nhamo had formed a tight-knit community of street kids, bound by their shared experiences and united in their pursuit of a better future. Together, they worked tirelessly to create a world where every child had a chance to thrive, regardless of their circumstances.  Nhamo's story became legendary, passed down through generations as a reminder of the power of honesty and hard work. His name became synonymous with integrity, and his legacy echoed through the city's streets.  And so, the tale of Nhamo, the street kid, serves as a timeless reminder that no matter where we come from or what challenges we face, with honesty, integrity, and diligence, we can overcome any obstacle and create a world where dreams become reality.",No,No

In botanical terms, a berry is a fleshy fruit produced from a single ovary, and bananas fit this definition perfectly. On the other hand, strawberries, despite their name, are not true berries.

I learnt that honesty is the cornerstone of integrity. It helps a person academically. The reward of maintaining honesty extend beyond avoiding penalties. The other thing I learnt is that working hard and being industrious implies that you are doing things that take courage and boldness. The key aspect of hard work is the commitment to continuous learning.

I don't want you to look back now! So, tell me:  üëâüèº How will you maintain your performance this month to ensure that you stay in the eligible category?  Ans: _The best is to stay connected to any 3-5 commited students which will be able to enroll before end of December month.  üëâüèºDo you remember, while discussing the grant, we set a goal to surpass the grant amount because I've always believed that 'Grant amount is limited, but the credits are unlimited.'

562 - 16 Dec 2023 06:23PM - +91 76268 84388: Since it‚Äôs going yo be Christmas soon I decided to write something about my experience from the last Christmas when I was with my family.  The Christmas ü§∂  It was a cold and snowy night on December 24th, 2023. I was sitting in the living room with my parents and my little brother ,watching a classic Christmas movie on TV. We had just finished decorating the tree and wrapping the presents, and we were feeling cozy and festive.  Suddenly, we heard a loud knock on the door. We wondered who it could be, since we were not expecting any visitors. My dad got up and opened the door, and we saw a familiar face standing outside. It was my uncle Ansy ,who had moved to Canada a few years ago. We had not seen him in a long time, and we were overjoyed to see him.  ""Surprise!"" he exclaimed, holding a big suitcase and a smile. ""I decided to come home for Christmas and spend some time with you guys. I hope you don't mind.""  ""Of course not!"" my mom said, hugging him warmly. ""We are so happy to see you. Come in, come in. You must be freezing.""  We all welcomed him into our house, and he joined us in the living room. He told us that he had booked a flight a few days ago, and he wanted to surprise us. He said that he missed us a lot, and he wanted to celebrate Christmas with his family. He also brought some gifts for us, which he had bought in Canada.  We were so touched by his gesture, and we thanked him for his generosity. We spent the next few hours catching up with him, and listening to his stories about his life in Canada. He told us about his job, his friends, and his adventures. He also showed us some pictures and videos on his phone. He seemed happy and successful, and we were proud of him.  We also shared our news and updates with him, and he was interested and supportive. He praised my sister for her good grades, and he congratulated me for winning a poetry contest. He also complimented my parents for their hard work and dedication. He said that he was glad that we were doing well, and he hoped that we would always be happy.  We had a lot of fun talking and laughing with him, and we felt a strong bond of love and affection. We realized how much we had missed him, and how much he meant to us. He was not just our uncle, he was our friend and our mentor.  We decided to have a late dinner together, and my mom cooked some delicious dishes for us. We enjoyed the food and the company, and we toasted to our family and our friendship. We also exchanged our gifts, and we were delighted with what we received. My uncle gave me a book of poems by a famous Canadian poet, and he gave my sister a pair of earrings that he had made himself. He gave my parents a beautiful painting of a snowy landscape, and he said that it reminded him of our home.  We thanked him for his thoughtful and creative gifts, and we gave him our gifts as well. We had bought him a sweater with the Indian flag on it, and we had made him a photo album with some of our favorite memories. He was moved by our gifts, and he said that he loved them. He said that he would always cherish them, and he would always remember us.  We hugged him and told him that we loved him too, and we would always miss him. We wished him a merry Christmas, and he wished us the same. We then settled down on the couch, and we watched the rest of the movie together. We felt warm and cozy, and we felt a sense of peace and joy. We knew that we had just experienced a wonderful Christmas miracle, and we were grateful for it.",No,No

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.  Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü  I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues.

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.  Activity Instructions:  Open Microsoft Excel:  Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you. Set Up Columns:  Create three columns with the following headers: ""Activity,"" ""Day of the Week,"" and ""Time Spent (in minutes)."" Record Your Activities:  Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing. In the ""Activity"" column, list each activity separately. Specify Days:  In the ""Day of the Week"" column, record the corresponding day for each activity. Log Time:  In the ""Time Spent"" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity. Calculate Average Time:  Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week. Reflect:  In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent. Save and Submit:  Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., ""WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx""). Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.  Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.  Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!  Best regards, Ms. Saloni
251 - 13 Dec 2023 02:03PM - Saloni Edoofa: *Happy Wednesday!*  I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into ‚Äì the virtues of honesty and hard work.  In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.  Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work ‚Äì a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.üåü  I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

One of our partnered universities, Lovely Professional University (LPU), which is among the top 100 universities in India, has been considering your application for the scholarship opportunity. They have mentioned that they would be able to give us an update by the month of January, considering the high volume of applications they have received in the past two months (more than 2000 applications).
251 - 14 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: In addition to this, the academic board also mentioned that there are a few more universities willing to put your application in consideration for scholarship opportunities in the month of January. Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.
252 - 14 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: With this update, I also want to inform you that since we are waiting for updates from the universities, we will be holding our conversation until 20th January and will reconnect around the same time. Until then, we wanted to share these updates with you so that you are well-informed about the process and know what lies ahead. We are thrilled to be a part of this new chapter in your academic journey.
253 - 14 Dec 2023 08:16PM - Ashi Edoofa: In the meantime, now that you are done with your admission process, you are encouraged to channel your energy and focus on your Earn While You Learn (EWYL) journey so that you can maximize the benefits from it. May this period be filled with meaningful learning, personal growth, and amazing opportunities.  If you are not connected with your EWYL Mentor or if you have any queries/concerns related to your admission journey, please feel free to reach out to us and we will do our best to assist you!

Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -  If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.  If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at Galgotias University without risking losing out on the scholarship.
244 - 15 Dec 2023 06:30PM - Ashi Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well -  Let us say you have paid $750 to Galgotias to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $750.  If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $750, but because you would have already paid $750 for Galgotias , the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $750 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university.  I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?

Given the $100 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a student you will be responsible for the remaining $900 of the registration fee. This $900  can be conveniently paid in two instalments as outlined below:  1. An initial payment of *$450  before the first deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).  2. A subsequent payment of *$450 before the second deadline date of January 28th, 2024* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
367 - 15 Dec 2023 10:07PM - Ashi Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures Name's registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to *make the full payment of $900 within 15 working days, before December 28th, 2023*.  I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?

Hence, they have recommended us to wait for the same updates before we help you finalize your university and secure your admission acceptance letter. This approach allows you to have multiple scholarship options, giving you the flexibility to decide on the university for your education in India and then carry out your visa application process the right way.

140 - 16 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding I am happy to know that you were able to learn a lot from the videos. Let me share my views as well so that it will help you expand your understanding.  *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students:* In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions.  You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent.
141 - 16 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA‚Äôs vision for you:* Here our founders talk about the most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
142 - 16 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program:* Talking about the third video, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
143 - 16 Dec 2023 12:04PM - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP:* Another thing is that Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based.  The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students‚Äô skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
144 - 16 Dec 2023 12:05PM - +263 77 756 4664: Yes thank you for this
145 - 16 Dec 2023 12:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: You are most welcome.  Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
146 - 16 Dec 2023 01:51PM - Kirti Edoofa: I was expecting to hear back from you, but as there hasn't been a response and given that it's been a long day for me, along with the conclusion of our working hours for Saturday, let's reconnect on Monday to continue our discussion.

112 - 16 Dec 2023 12:38PM - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*

191 - 16 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  *1) Application Form*  *2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  *3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
192 - 16 Dec 2023 12:44PM - +263 77 396 6666: Yes I will
193 - 16 Dec 2023 12:46PM - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it. Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*",No,No

23 - 14 Dec 2023 06:39PM - +263 78 006 4969: I am a boy named Tendai Mapindani. I did my O level at Masvingo Christian school and l proceeded to A level at the same school. I enjoy reading, let it be magazines, let it be newspapers l just love reading. I'm not into sports so l spent most of my time reading. It became an advantage to me because it led me into studying and pass my O level.  Now l'm a L6 student doing sciences (Mathematics, biology and geography) at Masvingo Christian Collage. With this combination l would like to study medicine, There are many reasons why someone might want to study medicine. It's my lifelong dream to become a doctor and help people. I may be drawn to the intellectual challenge of learning about the human body and how it works but l may see medicine as a way to make a difference in the world and improve people's lives, studying medicine can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience. It's not easy, but because l'm passionate about it, it can be incredibly rewarding. I stay with my mother and she is a teacher, she have a diploma in education, my father died in 2018. I have 3 siblings, l'm the first born, the second is now in Form 4, the third is in grade 5 and the fourth is in grade 1. My mom is the who has been supporting us financially for our education and she's the one who will be supporting us. My fee per term is $200 and lastly my school is Masvingo Christian Collage, it is Masvingo province.

212 - 16 Dec 2023 02:01PM - +27 78 760 0842: The average costs without scholarship in India is  about 6000 to 8000 us dollars while through edoofa scholarship is about 2000 to 3000 us dollars.
213 - 16 Dec 2023 02:07PM - +27 78 760 0842: How much would be the registration fee and when actually would it be needed?
214 - 16 Dec 2023 02:19PM - Austin: *Registration Fee* The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter.  *The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*  For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600
215 - 16 Dec 2023 02:22PM - +27 78 760 0842: Alright. Thank you. Just to be sure, Davies intake is one of those of 2025. I need to have a proper plan for him.

217 - 16 Dec 2023 03:02PM - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:  *Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.  *Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.  *Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS  *INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.  *Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.  *Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.  *Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.  *Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.   In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.

220 - 16 Dec 2023 03:38PM - Austin: As you know, students are currently occupied with lessons and exams due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Malawians, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for students. At the same time, the day scholars in Malawi are still applying and clearing the tests.  All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out.  *So are you or the parents willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Davie?*

147 - 16 Dec 2023 10:19AM - Gurvinder: I am delighted to hear that Thelma, moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
148 - 16 Dec 2023 11:03AM - +263 71 415 8096: Yaa basically that would be better costs sir
149 - 16 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Gurvinder: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
142 - 15 Dec 2023 05:20PM - +263 71 415 8096: Yes sir this will benefit me My views are that due to the access of the EWYL I might get more skill added to those I'm going to acquire from the program a will be learning and I will be able to know what it means to be an employed person before I even finish my education

177 - 16 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Gurvinder: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.  I hope you can now realize how we are different isn‚Äôt it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?

73 - 16 Dec 2023 11:39AM - Gurvinder: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
74 - 16 Dec 2023 11:39AM - Gurvinder: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it.

It's indeed a trying time when health issues bring forth financial burdens.  It's heartening to know that despite the challenges, there were well-wishers who stepped in to support Lushomo's education, recognizing her exceptional academic performance. Their kindness and support made a significant difference in enabling her to continue her education in boarding school.  Given Lushomo's aspirations for higher education abroad, may the well-wishers who generously supported her schooling consider extending their support for her further studies? Their contribution could profoundly impact her academic journey and help fulfill her aspirations.

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics.  *1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day‚Äôs span has a 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation.  *2. Parent‚Äôs Participation in the Process*- You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.  Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?

99 - 16 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Harmehak: Admirable knowledge and research, Ashley!
100 - 16 Dec 2023 10:17AM - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:  *1.

101 - 16 Dec 2023 10:18AM - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
124 - 16 Dec 2023 10:47AM - Harmehak: Let me add about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.  The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
125 - 16 Dec 2023 10:48AM - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
126 - 16 Dec 2023 10:48AM - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:  *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

129 - 16 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Harmehak: I appreciate please
130 - 16 Dec 2023 11:14AM - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well,  Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*  What are you thoughts on the same please?
131 - 16 Dec 2023 11:23AM - +263 78 126 5975: I think it‚Äôs a good idea
132 - 16 Dec 2023 11:32AM - Harmehak: Indeed please.
133 - 16 Dec 2023 11:33AM - Harmehak: Ashley, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.  Wouldn't you agree to the same?

178 - 16 Dec 2023 05:43PM - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.  Are you ready?
179 - 16 Dec 2023 05:47PM - +263 78 126 5975: My network is kind of tripping
180 - 16 Dec 2023 05:48PM - Harmehak: I understand, you can respond accordingly.
181 - 16 Dec 2023 05:49PM - Harmehak: Ashley, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn‚Äôt given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
182 - 16 Dec 2023 05:49PM - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*

59 - 16 Dec 2023 01:32PM - Harmehak: May I know your understanding of a fully funded scholarship?
60 - 16 Dec 2023 01:41PM - +263 78 951 8939: I think it's a schoolarship whereby school fees, food, residand and some academic staff is provided for free to studends
61 - 16 Dec 2023 01:50PM - Harmehak: Actually you are mistaken over here, let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
62 - 16 Dec 2023 03:00PM - +263 78 951 8939: Ok ok sure l was mistaken here Now l understand the difference between the two . This one is question is aschoolarship, it meant to reduce parent's burden on education not providing everythingü´£ü´£ Am l correct?
63 - 16 Dec 2023 03:00PM - +263 78 951 8939: Thank you so much

334 - 15 Dec 2023 03:22PM - Harmehak: All the applicants who would be traveling to India for 2025 year's academic intake, Their application would utilize this time duration in the following ways:  1. The student would be working on their Earn While You Learn Program:- Having a head start that too of more than 20 months helps a student have a better hold in their EWYL Journey. During these years, one thing which I have personally witnessed is that a student who have better understanding of their EWYL projects and the ones who earn higher amount of scholarship credits every month, are the ones who always had this headstart in their career.  Giving you an example, Persistance Muza the student who earned over $4000 worth or scholarship credits, became a part of the Edoofa Program for his August 2022 intake in August 2021. The student earned more than $1900 worth of scholarship credits before even coming to India and within just a couple of months after arriving he has now earned an additional $2100 worth of scholarship credits, which has ensured his parents that he can cater for his annual fee after the scholarship through his hard work in the Earn While You Learn Program itself.  This happened only because students like him had time to understand the projects and assignments while being in their home country.  2. Parents would be communicating with the Admission's Team:- Having ample amount of time in hand, not just benefits the student but actually helps the parent as well to plan better for their child's international education journey. Therefore to utilize this for your advantage, you would be interacting with the admissions team and start preparing for your child's international journey for 2025. This means that if you are supposed to start saving for your child's annual fee after scholarship, this becomes the right time since admission officers would brief you on a regular basis regarding how you should plan for the finances, if you face any challenges you could get the same addressed since you have time before your child finally travels.  3,  Having the benefit of the Community:- This part doesn't just benefits the student but actually benefits the entire family. The moment student becomes a part of the Edoofa Program he/she starts interacting with other students who are a part of the community, this helps the student to connect with toppers of their fields, students who have scored a perfect result in their A Level during their academic year, this way a student gets the access to get all his/her queries addressed in terms of academics for their current year of education from the topper students, thereby reducing the need of private tuitions for the same, for which the parents would have paid additional money over and above their school fee.
335 - 15 Dec 2023 04:10PM - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Mr Nhau?
336 - 16 Dec 2023 05:48AM - +263 77 604 3267: Noted. But I am not ready to pay the enrollment fee within the stated dates 21  or 22 December 2023 and I am kindly asking for an allowance of time to do the preparations

339 - 16 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Harmehak: Were you able to go through the same please?
340 - 16 Dec 2023 10:33AM - Harmehak: I wanted to have a word regarding the fee payment timeline, since you shared with me that you need time for completion of Christabel's fee formalities as it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline.  I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
341 - 16 Dec 2023 11:11AM - +263 77 604 3267: Yes acknowledged
342 - 16 Dec 2023 11:13AM - Harmehak: I did discuss about Christabel's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Christabel's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.  Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it? <This message was edited>",No,No

380 - 16 Dec 2023 10:28AM - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate you acknowledging your support for Tatenda.
381 - 16 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.  I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
382 - 16 Dec 2023 10:29AM - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-  1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.  2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Or  A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.",No,No

Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

144 - 16 Dec 2023 12:21PM - +263 71 973 7102: From my research ....india ha emerged as a destination with cutting  edge education, cultural ethos , english as the primary medium of instruction  and students who are mentally  , academically and emotionally  prepared to  take on the world.  The education system  in india is affordable than in other countries. As compared to other countries there is higher education in india because of the  dominance  of English  for instance many countries do not use english language but it is a global  language .hence it can be noted that its beneficial for one to educate it in india. The indian education system is also beneficial  to Africans  when they study there they may educate diverse traditions  , cultures , rituals which are practised there.therefore whey they came back to their origin  countries  they would bring more knowlege  , skills which enhance the development  and growth of the country.   On my research  i have found  that     mathematics and science which are recommended by Africans to be studied  are also studied in india.hence thats why  many people of the indian origin on top and indian scientists  making path  breaking technological  research  and  advances.therefore i have admired this opportunity  for Africans to study and observe the rigorious curriculum in india that gives rise to such brainy and enterprising  students of medicine and technology.  In coclusion i can say that the  affordability  , quality education system of India  determines a successful life , archievement of goals when one study  there.

249 - 16 Dec 2023 12:38PM - Kunal: Good to hear that
250 - 16 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Kunal: *Earn While You Learn Program*  To explain it elaborately, The *Earn While You Learn Program* was designed to ensure our students get the necessary employability skills to succeed in the 21st-century job market. Coupled with a quality, affordable higher education experience, it ensures our students become top professionals, leaders and pioneers in their fields.
251 - 16 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Kunal: Students are given real-time live online projects based on digital marketing, organization management to develop soft skills like communication skills, leadership, presentation skills, teamwork, etc.during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student's performance) which wouldn't be physical cash but they can contribute to a part of their higher education fees and make their university education even more affordable. The working hours would be flexible and they would be able to make the free time productive.
252 - 16 Dec 2023 12:39PM - Kunal: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  *NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.

40 - 16 Dec 2023 12:02PM - Kunal: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

157 - 16 Dec 2023 02:18PM - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university  Isn't it?
158 - 16 Dec 2023 04:25PM - +263 78 083 8150: Yes, you are absolutely correct. When a student plans to apply for a university abroad, the following requirements are typically involved:  1) *Application Form*: This is a formal document where students provide their personal and academic information, including educational background, achievements, and contact details.  2) *Statement of Purpose*: Often required for graduate school applications, this essay highlights the student's motivations, goals, academic interests, and how they align with the chosen program or university. It helps the admission committee in assessing the applicant's suitability.  3) *Letter(s) of Recommendation*: These letters are written by senior authorities, such as professors, employers, or academic advisors, who can attest to the student's capabilities, skills, and suitability for higher education. These recommendations add credibility to the application.  These three components - application form, statement of purpose, and letter of recommendation - are typically crucial parts of the application package when applying to a university abroad.",No,No

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many. With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process. This reduced cost includes: *1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)* *2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)* *3. Food* *4. Accommodation*

313 - 16 Dec 2023 06:03PM - Sahil Edoofa: Okay so basically you see in the first mode, the Direct Bank Transfer Mode, the transfer charges which are to be borne by the parents of the student ranges between $100 to $120 which become quite high for a lot of parents considering the economic situation in Zimbabwe itself. So as not every student is in a position to cater for an additional $100 to $120 just as transfer charge, the second mode was introduced, wherein, it is the Bank deposit in Mr. Charles's Account, in this the transfer charges get divided amongst 10 students resulting in an equivalent bearing of 12.5% at the end.  So as you can see in the letter that there is a Bank deposit in, Mr. Charles Jerera (Retired Education Officer)'s account as he is our Associated Partner there in Zimbabwe, Since 2020 there have been over 1400+ students who have been assisted by Mr Charles inorder to complete their enrollment formalities as well as university fee payments after arriving in India.",No,No

I wish to draw your attention to the fascinating parallels between Indian and Zimbabwean cuisines, underscoring the shared elements that reflect a delightful convergence of culinary traditions. Despite the geographical expanse that separates our cultures, both Indian and Zimbabwean culinary landscapes celebrate a rich tapestry of flavors. The use of aromatic spices, the incorporation of fresh and seasonal ingredients, and a reverence for communal dining are notable commonalities. From foundational staples such as rice and bread to the diverse array of vegetables and meats, the similarities in essence are unmistakable. While each culture exhibits its unique spice palette and culinary techniques, the fundamental spirit of uniting people through delightful and nourishing meals is a shared value. Exploring the nuances of Indian cuisine may offer a profound appreciation for the cultural resonance it shares with Zimbabwean gastronomy!

186 - 16 Dec 2023 10:27AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. India stands out as an unparalleled destination for pursuing your chosen career path. The country boasts a remarkable pool of talent, with individuals actively contributing to the success of some of the world's leading companies, particularly in the field of computer science. Studying in India offers a unique opportunity to engage with these brilliant minds, fostering valuable connections that can significantly propel your career forward. The Indian software industry, renowned for its innovation and expertise, provides an ideal environment for aspiring software engineers like yourself. By immersing yourself in this dynamic ecosystem, you not only gain exposure to cutting-edge technologies but also position yourself to learn from the best in the field. The trust and support garnered from interactions with Indian business tycoons can be instrumental in shaping your journey to the top, ensuring a successful and fulfilling career in software engineering! I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
187 - 16 Dec 2023 10:30AM - +263 71 962 3537: No I'm not familiar with it.
188 - 16 Dec 2023 10:54AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Tinodaishe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

192 - 16 Dec 2023 10:59AM - +263 71 962 3537: So is the money paid one time or?

193 - 16 Dec 2023 11:15AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. This cost is paid in two equal installments. Each installment is paid before a semester. There are two semesters¬†in¬†a¬†year.
194 - 16 Dec 2023 11:16AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
195 - 16 Dec 2023 12:03PM - +263 71 962 3537: The opportunity to work is a good one. That way I get to help my parents and earn experience too.
196 - 16 Dec 2023 12:03PM - +263 71 962 3537: No I don't, enlighten me please
197 - 16 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Tinodaishe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
199 - 16 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: - The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are: Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0 Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
200 - 16 Dec 2023 12:12PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: - Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:- Nigenuis Skooqs Success Magazine TIA Organics
201 - 16 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
202 - 16 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
203 - 16 Dec 2023 12:25PM - +263 71 962 3537: Honestly I think that the EWYL is a very big opportunity for an aspiring student. It gives me a chance to have insight on what I will be doing after I complete the degree and it also introduces me to the game earlier. When I finish my degree I will be an expert in my industry, so yes I think this will be very beneficial to me.
204 - 16 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month
205 - 16 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._  Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
206 - 16 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $2200, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $1100 in the first semester and $1100 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.  Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
207 - 16 Dec 2023 12:54PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.  In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.  A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

115 - 16 Dec 2023 02:38PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am fully aware of the economic hardships that James and his family are facing, and I commend your efforts in trying to create linkages for him. I understand that the needs around him are vast, and your compassionate efforts to navigate through these challenges are truly admirable, Mr. Farai. However, I believe you must be familiar with the fact that *Edoofa* is a Merit-Based Scholarship Program and not a charitable organization, please.  The quantum of scholarship depends totally on a student's performance during various stages of the evaluation including tests and interviews. Additionally, his/her academic results, O level, and A level results. Moreover, his/her participation in extracurricular activities will be taken into account as well. Furthermore, may I inquire if you are familiar with the criteria for receiving a 100% scholarship and the recipients of such scholarships?
116 - 16 Dec 2023 03:22PM - +263 78 351 7754: Hie Sir, I think Mr Farai isn't available for this moment. Since he knows that we are in the discussion I hope he will be right back as soon as possible. Thank you for your great concern over my matter Sir!
117 - 16 Dec 2023 03:52PM - +263 77 274 9214: Good afternoon.  My apologies.  I am traveling and connectivity is weak at some points along the way.  I am not familiar with the criteria for a 100% scholarship.  I am, however, familiar with James' socio-economic background, and I am also aware that he passed his Advanced level examinations.  If there are tests to be written and interviews to be undertaken, James is at your disposal: to be tested in whatever manner you deem appropriate.  I am pained by the reality of his situation. I would like to connect him to the next level. Should EDOOFA provide James with a 100% scholarship even with strings attached, I would really be grateful.",No,No

76 - 16 Dec 2023 10:27AM - +263 71 315 9162: My education journey started way back in 2008 in Elementary school. During this time I wasn't that bright and performed as an average student. After I graduated I continued this journey at Southerton primary. I struggled a little bit during the first years at this school but eventually I would go on to become one of the best students at the school and finished with excellent results. It was also at this school that I discovered that school was not only my calling but  also playing soccer was another talent i had.I was also one of the best at my school. I finished junior school in 2017 and proceeded with my journey at Howard High School, a boarding school in Chiweshe. It was at this school that I founded my true inner being and my purpose in life. Through the various clubs I joined and some inspirational friends I met I became more ambitious and motivated to achieve finer things in life. It was at this stage that my obsession for business started. I started studying hard and slept late to achieve better grades and it paid off as l came out with good results. These where my results for ordinary level: Accounting       A Geography        A Business Studies  B Mathematics      B English           B Combined Science B Shona.           B History           B Agriculture       D Shona literature   E I also continued playing soccer at this school and at one time we almost went to the nationals but the tournament was cancelled due to the corona virus pandemic. I left Howard High school in 2022 and I went on to study my Advanced level at Best college. I was the in the commercial class where I studied Accounting, Business Studies and Pure Mathematics. At this school things weren't going well for me. I took extra classes to keep up with my standards. We wrote our final examinations this year in November and the  results will be out in mid January. I also continued playing soccer at this school and we won the annual school tournament where I was nominated for the player of the tournament award.  Both my parents are present. Im the first born in my family and i have 3 siblings. My father is 43 and unemployed. He runs a small restaurant in our town where I'm also working. He did fine in school and managed to attain a degree in accounting. My mother is 38 and she is also unemployed. She managed to write her ordinary level but her mother would eventually die and she would drop out of school to work and support her siblings.
77 - 16 Dec 2023 10:45AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! The combination of athletics and academics is indeed exquisite. I really appreciate how sincere you were in expressing yourself, Kelly. Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable.  From overcoming challenges in your early years to emerging as one of the best students and soccer players at your school, you've demonstrated resilience and determination. The discovery of your passion for business and commitment to academic excellence during your time at Howard High School is truly commendable. Even in the face of the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, your dedication to your studies and soccer pursuits shines through. Transitioning to Best College for your Advanced level studies showcases your unwavering pursuit of knowledge. Your involvement in soccer and academic achievements, including the nomination for the player of the tournament award, reflects your well-rounded and accomplished character! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance! Could you kindly shed more light on the professions your parents pertain to, please?

My Mother is a clothes runner and hasn't been employed to any company.

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?

118 - 16 Dec 2023 03:24PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. Do you have a general idea about the cost of education in your home country, please?
119 - 16 Dec 2023 03:26PM - +263 71 133 9475: its 300  per semester leaving off campus
120 - 16 Dec 2023 03:32PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Now considering that your home country is Zimbabwe. The average tuition fees of a decent university in Zimbabwe is 1200-1500$ a year which roughly means 750$ per term. On top of that the cost of food averages around 1$ per meal. Plus the miscellaneous charges including internet and accommodation are around 2000-2500$ per annum. Therefore, resulting in 3000-4000$ a year. Will you be able to afford this type of education which barely leads to employment? Many of our students who are already in India with us have mentioned that students who are studying in Zimbabwe are barely getting any jobs after completing their respective courses.  Will you be content with the fact that you are spending money and time on a degree like that?
121 - 16 Dec 2023 03:36PM - +263 71 133 9475: no i would not want that type of education
122 - 16 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Makomborero. If a student meets and exceeds our academic criteria with a high passing grade, he/she becomes eligible for an exclusive scholarship. With the exclusive Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1600-$2300, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!

Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
274 - 14 Dec 2023 06:44PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be  1) *Application Form*  2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.  3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
275 - 14 Dec 2023 07:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
276 - 16 Dec 2023 06:05AM - +263 78 879 1598: Ok ,  I would want to add more requirements to those you have stated already ,  yeah firstly the students should have a passport in order for her or him to apply for a university abroad , secondly the students should have some academic transcripts and thirdly some references are also  requirements for the student to apply abroad. Thank you.

280 - 16 Dec 2023 07:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Mishel!
281 - 16 Dec 2023 07:27PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student‚Äôs application or they would straightaway reject it.  Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not* And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.",No,No

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year.

120 - 16 Dec 2023 11:39AM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mnqobi. You will be glad to know that we have familiarized ourselves with the economic condition of African nations and we offer something special and extremely valuable to our *Edoofians*. Looking at the cost of education, there's a chance that it won't be affordable for everyone. As a result, Edoofa offers students work opportunities while they are studying in order for them to gain scholarship credits, which can help them reduce their expenses even further.  Sounds impressive? Do you have any idea how that's done?
121 - 16 Dec 2023 11:51AM - +263 78 439 7083: Yes l do have an idea

124 - 16 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Mnqobi. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
128 - 16 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: - We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: - Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade. How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu It‚Äôs never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
129 - 16 Dec 2023 12:14PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.  These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.  What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?

130 - 16 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I must say your grasping power is impeccable! Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.  Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
131 - 16 Dec 2023 01:42PM - +263 77 547 9740: No l am not familiar with the cost
132 - 16 Dec 2023 02:22PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Simphiwe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.  In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many. So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process. This cost includes: 1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

The credits would go a long way in lessening the fees burden while preparing the student for the real world.
174 - 16 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I‚Äôll have to add that I‚Äôm flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!  Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling : 1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ‚Äã: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.  2. *Employability through practical training* ‚Äã: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
175 - 16 Dec 2023 03:56PM - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What‚Äôs more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.  4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.

It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.

Now while this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc, it is still beyond the reach of many. So EDOOFA works with universities to secure seats on scholarships for its students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.
95 - 16 Dec 2023 12:31PM - Shubham Madhwal: *But, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year*. This cost includes:  1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any) 2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.) 3. Food 4. Accommodation

However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

One of the first things the new government did was to eliminate the reference to ethnicity in identification documents. From then on, the country's inhabitants were all ""Rwandans.""The practice of doing regular community work, which was grounded in the Rwandan tradition of ""umuganda,"" was reintroduced not only as part of the effort to rebuild the country but as a way to foster a community spirit. Once a month, Rwandans are called upon to perform communal tasks such as building a house for the needy, laying a road or sweeping a square.This country has certainly come farther in the past 16 years than even the most optimistic observers would have predicted. All of this development is important to recognize because it has been the government‚Äôs express policy to deliver basic services and economic growth to its people in order to mitigate genocide ideology.Five years ago, traveling anywhere in the country was bound to be a bumpy ride, if the way was even passable. Today, east-to-west and north-to-south, the road infrastructure is impressive and continues to expand. Five years ago, the country struggled to get tourists in for $375 permits to visit Rwanda‚Äôs mountain gorillas. Today, during high season, there are not enough $500 tickets to meet the demand. Five years ago, there were no supermarkets or ATMs, and the cheapest cell phones cost $50. Today there are multiple supermarkets, over a dozen international ATMs, and cell phones that cost $14 are plentiful.

Please type your answers in the group directly.  2. For MCQ Questions you can directly type the options  3. If you have any doubts regarding the test or any information, you can ask without hesitation. --------------------------------------------------------  SECTION 1:- PERSONAL INFORMATION  Name as per School Record- Gender- Date of Birth as per School Record- Father's Name- Mother's Name- Email Address- Parent's email address- Course: Intake Year: Country :   SECTION 2 READING TEST  Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage. If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.  Whey to Go Greek yogurt‚Äîa strained form of cultured yogurt‚Äîhas grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

241 - 16 Dec 2023 03:08PM - Shubham Madhwal: Glad to hear that please
242 - 16 Dec 2023 03:56PM - +263 78 246 5302: Section 1  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: b) The Will to Fight  2. A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways. What are they? c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage and face the danger.  3. The meaning of the word debilitating is: a) enfeeble  4. The phrase 'gather resolution from danger' means: c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because: b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time.  Section 2  6. D) outweigh  7. B) can pollute waterways,  8. C) scientists, and  9. C) after sentence 2.  Section 3  10. (x - 1)/3 = k (x - 1)/3 = 3 3 * (x - 1)/3 = 3 * 3 (x - 1) = 9 (x - 1) + 1 = 9 + 1 x = 10  Therefore, the value of x is 10. So the correct answer is D) 10.  11. Real part: 7 + (-8) = -1 Imaginary part: 3i + 9i = 12i  So the sum is -1 + 12i. Therefore, the correct answer is A) -1 + 12i.  12. In the equation P = 108 - 23d, the value 108 represents the initial number of phones that Kathy starts with each week. This means that Kathy begins each week with 108 phones to fix. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix.  13. Given that a/b = 2, b/a = ¬π/2 4(b/a)= 4(1/2) 2  14. To solve the system of equations 3x + 4y = -23 and 2y - x = -19, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Substituting for x 3(2y+19) + 4y = -23 10y = -80 y = -8  Therefore x = 2(-8) +19 x = 3  Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (x, y) = (3, -8). The correct answer is B) (3, -8).  15.  Therefore, the point (14, 2) lies on the line. The correct answer is D) (14, 2).  16. Given the equation t^2 - 4 = 0 and t > 0, we can solve for t by taking the square root of both sides:  ‚àö(t^2 - 4) = ‚àö0 t = ¬±2  Since t > 0, the value of t is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 2.  Section 5  Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has seen significant progress in various aspects. The genocide in 1994 left the country devastated, with millions of people dead, communities shattered, and infrastructure destroyed. However, through resilience, unity, and determined efforts, Rwanda has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens.  One of the most remarkable aspects of life in Rwanda today is the unity and reconciliation that has been fostered among its people. After the genocide, the government implemented a comprehensive plan to promote national unity and healing. The Gacaca courts were established to hold community-based trials, allowing both victims and perpetrators to come together, share their stories, and seek forgiveness. Through these efforts, Rwanda has managed to restore a sense of trust and social cohesion among its citizens.  Furthermore, Rwanda has made significant progress in terms of economic development. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, attract foreign investment, and diversify the economy. As a result, Rwanda has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, with an average GDP growth rate of around 8% per year. This has led to a reduction in poverty rates and an improvement in living standards for many Rwandans.  Education is another area where Rwanda has made significant strides. The government has prioritized education as a means to build a knowledge-based society and create opportunities for its citizens. Today, primary school enrollment rates are close to 100%, and the government has made efforts to increase access to secondary and tertiary education as well. This focus on education has not only empowered individuals but also contributed to the overall development of the country.  In terms of infrastructure development, Rwanda has made impressive achievements. The government has invested heavily in building roads, bridges, and other transportation networks, connecting previously isolated regions and improving access to markets. Additionally, the country has embraced technology and innovation, positioning itself as a hub for tech startups and digital services. These advancements have not only improved the quality of life for Rwandans but have also attracted international attention and investment.  Despite these positive developments, challenges still remain. The scars of the genocide continue to linger, and there is a need for ongoing healing and reconciliation efforts. Furthermore, while poverty rates have decreased, income inequality remains a pressing issue. The government must continue to address these challenges to ensure a more equitable and inclusive society.  In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has witnessed remarkable progress. Through unity, reconciliation, and determined efforts, the country has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens. Rwanda's achievements in economic development, education, and infrastructure are commendable. However, challenges persist, and the government must continue to address them to ensure a more inclusive and prosperous society. Despite the challenges, Rwanda serves as an inspiring example of resilience and the power of collective healing.   Section 6  Life often throws unexpected challenges our way, testing our resilience and determination. My journey has been no exception, as I have faced numerous obstacles while striving to achieve my goals. However, it is through these trials that I have discovered my true strength and learned valuable lessons that have shaped me into the person I am today.  From a young age, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world of technology. However, coming from a humble background and lacking the resources and opportunities that others may have had, I had to carve my own path. I worked tirelessly to educate myself, devouring books, online courses, and any available resources to expand my knowledge.  In the pursuit of success, failure is inevitable. Instead of letting setbacks discourage me, I viewed them as valuable learning experiences. Each failure taught me a new lesson and fueled my determination to succeed. It was through this mindset that I developed resilience and a growth mindset, understanding that failure is not the end but a stepping stone towards success.  No journey can be completed alone. Recognizing this, I actively sought out mentors who could guide and inspire me. Their wisdom and guidance proved invaluable, helping me navigate the complex world of technology. Additionally, I surrounded myself with peers who shared similar goals and aspirations, creating a supportive network that uplifted and motivated each other.  Obstacles are bound to arise on any journey, and my path was no exception. Financial constraints, self-doubt, and societal expectations often threatened to derail my progress. However, I refused to succumb to these challenges. Instead, I dug deep within myself, reminding myself of my passion and the impact I wanted to make. This unwavering commitment to my vision fueled my perseverance and propelled me forward.  As I started achieving my own goals, I realized the importance of giving back and empowering others. I became involved in initiatives that aimed to bridge the digital divide, providing access to technology and education for underprivileged communities. By sharing my knowledge and resources, I hope to inspire others and create a more inclusive and equitable future.  My journey has been a testament to the power of resilience, determination, and the belief in oneself. While the road has been challenging, it has also been incredibly rewarding. Each obstacle I overcame, each failure I experienced, and each person I helped along the way has shaped me into the person I am today. I am proud of my journey, and I am grateful for the lessons I have learned. I am confident that these experiences will continue to guide me as I strive to make a lasting impact in the world of technology.

242 - 16 Dec 2023 03:56PM - +263 78 246 5302: Section 1  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: b) The Will to Fight  2. A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways. What are they? c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage and face the danger.  3. The meaning of the word debilitating is: a) enfeeble  4. The phrase 'gather resolution from danger' means: c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because: b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time.  Section 2  6. D) outweigh  7. B) can pollute waterways,  8. C) scientists, and  9. C) after sentence 2.  Section 3  10. (x - 1)/3 = k (x - 1)/3 = 3 3 * (x - 1)/3 = 3 * 3 (x - 1) = 9 (x - 1) + 1 = 9 + 1 x = 10  Therefore, the value of x is 10. So the correct answer is D) 10.  11. Real part: 7 + (-8) = -1 Imaginary part: 3i + 9i = 12i  So the sum is -1 + 12i. Therefore, the correct answer is A) -1 + 12i.  12. In the equation P = 108 - 23d, the value 108 represents the initial number of phones that Kathy starts with each week. This means that Kathy begins each week with 108 phones to fix. Therefore, the correct answer is B) Kathy starts each week with 108 phones to fix.  13. Given that a/b = 2, b/a = ¬π/2 4(b/a)= 4(1/2) 2  14. To solve the system of equations 3x + 4y = -23 and 2y - x = -19, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Substituting for x 3(2y+19) + 4y = -23 10y = -80 y = -8  Therefore x = 2(-8) +19 x = 3  Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is (x, y) = (3, -8). The correct answer is B) (3, -8).  15.  Therefore, the point (14, 2) lies on the line. The correct answer is D) (14, 2).  16. Given the equation t^2 - 4 = 0 and t > 0, we can solve for t by taking the square root of both sides:  ‚àö(t^2 - 4) = ‚àö0 t = ¬±2  Since t > 0, the value of t is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is B) 2.  Section 5  Life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has seen significant progress in various aspects. The genocide in 1994 left the country devastated, with millions of people dead, communities shattered, and infrastructure destroyed. However, through resilience, unity, and determined efforts, Rwanda has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens.  One of the most remarkable aspects of life in Rwanda today is the unity and reconciliation that has been fostered among its people. After the genocide, the government implemented a comprehensive plan to promote national unity and healing. The Gacaca courts were established to hold community-based trials, allowing both victims and perpetrators to come together, share their stories, and seek forgiveness. Through these efforts, Rwanda has managed to restore a sense of trust and social cohesion among its citizens.  Furthermore, Rwanda has made significant progress in terms of economic development. The government has implemented various initiatives to promote entrepreneurship, attract foreign investment, and diversify the economy. As a result, Rwanda has experienced steady economic growth over the past decade, with an average GDP growth rate of around 8% per year. This has led to a reduction in poverty rates and an improvement in living standards for many Rwandans.  Education is another area where Rwanda has made significant strides. The government has prioritized education as a means to build a knowledge-based society and create opportunities for its citizens. Today, primary school enrollment rates are close to 100%, and the government has made efforts to increase access to secondary and tertiary education as well. This focus on education has not only empowered individuals but also contributed to the overall development of the country.  In terms of infrastructure development, Rwanda has made impressive achievements. The government has invested heavily in building roads, bridges, and other transportation networks, connecting previously isolated regions and improving access to markets. Additionally, the country has embraced technology and innovation, positioning itself as a hub for tech startups and digital services. These advancements have not only improved the quality of life for Rwandans but have also attracted international attention and investment.  Despite these positive developments, challenges still remain. The scars of the genocide continue to linger, and there is a need for ongoing healing and reconciliation efforts. Furthermore, while poverty rates have decreased, income inequality remains a pressing issue. The government must continue to address these challenges to ensure a more equitable and inclusive society.  In conclusion, life in Rwanda 16 years after the genocide has witnessed remarkable progress. Through unity, reconciliation, and determined efforts, the country has managed to rebuild itself and create a better future for its citizens. Rwanda's achievements in economic development, education, and infrastructure are commendable. However, challenges persist, and the government must continue to address them to ensure a more inclusive and prosperous society. Despite the challenges, Rwanda serves as an inspiring example of resilience and the power of collective healing.   Section 6  Life often throws unexpected challenges our way, testing our resilience and determination. My journey has been no exception, as I have faced numerous obstacles while striving to achieve my goals. However, it is through these trials that I have discovered my true strength and learned valuable lessons that have shaped me into the person I am today.  From a young age, I knew that I wanted to make a difference in the world of technology. However, coming from a humble background and lacking the resources and opportunities that others may have had, I had to carve my own path. I worked tirelessly to educate myself, devouring books, online courses, and any available resources to expand my knowledge.  In the pursuit of success, failure is inevitable. Instead of letting setbacks discourage me, I viewed them as valuable learning experiences. Each failure taught me a new lesson and fueled my determination to succeed. It was through this mindset that I developed resilience and a growth mindset, understanding that failure is not the end but a stepping stone towards success.  No journey can be completed alone.

Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship.

If a person suddenly encounters any terrible danger, the change of nature one undergoes is equally great. Sometimes fear numbs our senses. Like animals, one stands still, powerless to move a step in fright or to lift a hand in defense of our lives, and sometimes one is seized with panic, and again, act more like the inferior animals than rational beings. On the other hand, frequently in cases of sudden extreme peril, which cannot be escaped by flight, and must be instantly faced, even the most timid men at once as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, sharp quick apprehension and swift decision. This is a miracle very common in nature. Man and the inferior animals alike, when confronted with almost certain death ‚Äò gather resolution from despair‚Äô but there can really be no trace of so debilitating a feeling in the person fighting, or prepare d to fight for dear life. At such times the mind is clearer than it has ever been; the nerves are steel, there is nothing felt but a wonderful strength and daring. Looking back at certain perilous moments in my own life, I remember them with a kind of joy, not that there was any joyful excitement then, but because they broadened my horizon, lifted me for a time above myself.  1. The title that best suits the passage would be: a) The Change of Nature b) The Will to Fight c) Courage and Panic d) The Miracle of Confronting Danger  2.A man may react to sudden danger in three different ways . What are they? a) He may be paralyzed with fear, run away or fight. b) He may flee in panic, or fight back or stand still. c) He may be paralyzed with fear, or seized with panic, or as if by miracle, become possessed of the necessary courage, and face the danger. d) He may be paralyzed with fear, seized with panic or act like an inferior animal.  3.What is the meaning of the word debilitating ? a) enfeeble b) thriving c) strengthen d) debase  4. Explain the phrase ‚Äògather resolution from danger‚Äô. a) Find peace in times of difficulty. b) To remain calm and not to lose hope. c) A state of utter hopelessness makes one determined to face the difficulty. d) To be enthusiastic and brave the odds.  5. The author feels happy in the recollection of dangers faced and overcome because a) He felt elated as he was alive. b) They added a new perspective and lifted him above himself for a time. c) They brought him a new experience. d) These experiences boosted his confidence.  SECTION 3 LANGUAGE TEST  Each passage below is accompanied by a number of questions. For some questions, you will consider how the passage might be revised to improve the expression of ideas. For other questions, you will consider how the passage might be edited to correct errors in sentence structure, usage, or punctuation. A passage or a question may be accompanied by one or more graphics (such as a table or graph) that you will consider as you make revising and editing decisions. Some questions will direct you to an underlined portion of a passage. Other questions will direct you to a location in a passage or ask you to think about the passage as a whole. After reading each passage, choose the answer to each question that most effectively improves the quality of writing in the passage or that makes the passage conform to the conventions of standard written English. Many questions include a ‚ÄúNO CHANGE‚Äù option. Choose that option if you think the best choice is to leave the relevant portion of the passage as it is.

From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment.

Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt. Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.  6. outdo A) NO CHANGE B) defeat C) outperform D) outweigh  7.can pollute waterways A) NO CHANGE B) can pollute waterways, C) could have polluted waterways, D) has polluted waterway‚Äôs,  8.scientists; and A) NO CHANGE B) scientists: and C) scientists, and D) scientists, and,  9.To make this paragraph most logical, Sentence 5 should be placed A) where it is now.

80 - 16 Dec 2023 12:37PM - Shubham Madhwal: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.  Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it

130 - 16 Dec 2023 01:13PM - Tushti: So by any chance are you or your family members familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?
131 - 16 Dec 2023 01:22PM - +260 777828100: Yes of what my family and I know is that a person who is studying in India for medicine in India it's about it about 50,000 to about 200,000
132 - 16 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Tushti: Alright, let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.
133 - 16 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Tushti: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
134 - 16 Dec 2023 01:22PM - Tushti: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
142 - 16 Dec 2023 01:30PM - Tushti: However, first, I would like to hear from your parents whether they understand the cost of education
143 - 16 Dec 2023 01:31PM - +260 777828100: Okay then am asking if you can wait a bit lemme call my dad to be online
144 - 16 Dec 2023 01:35PM - +260 777828100: Sir daddy has gone for church and his phone his switched off can he his not answering can we proceed while I continue trying  sorry for these inconveniences sir
145 - 16 Dec 2023 02:04PM - +260 777828100: Sir am waiting

97 - 16 Dec 2023 11:46AM - Tushti: Everything has been explained above, please
98 - 16 Dec 2023 11:47AM - Tushti: Kindly go through the chat and let me know if you have any questions
99 - 16 Dec 2023 11:54AM - +260 97 7865571: I have gone through everything and I have understood everything
100 - 16 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Tushti: Very well, now let me explain the EWYL Program to you in detail
101 - 16 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Tushti: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn *scholarship credits* (based on student‚Äôs performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.  It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing ‚Äì just to name a few.  The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.  Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
102 - 16 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student‚Äôs education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.  _*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
103 - 16 Dec 2023 12:25PM - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
104 - 16 Dec 2023 12:26PM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
132 - 16 Dec 2023 01:17PM - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
133 - 16 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Tushti: You see Edoofa's exceptional program has opened up a world of opportunities for aspiring students, garnering thousands of applications on a daily basis. The Eligibility Evaluation process ensures that deserving candidates are granted the chance to participate in the program. *Once accepted, students are required to pay a nominal Program Fee of $350 within 7 days of receiving their acceptance letter*, following which they commence with their admission process and the esteemed Earn While You Learn Program. Edoofa's mission to provide quality education and support to students is at the heart of this initiative, and we are honored to make a difference in the lives of deserving individuals through this program.
134 - 16 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days
135 - 16 Dec 2023 01:18PM - Tushti: I hope you are able to understand?
136 - 16 Dec 2023 02:17PM - +260 777004720: Understood
137 - 16 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Tushti: Now, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
138 - 16 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Tushti: <Media omitted>
139 - 16 Dec 2023 02:35PM - +260 777004720: Ok
140 - 16 Dec 2023 02:35PM - Tushti: Alright Bright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.  Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself.
141 - 16 Dec 2023 02:36PM - Tushti: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.

Was busy during the day to respond to all of these things but there is no way you can get money from us it's better we continue with what we were having than to be scammed money over unnecessary things please
68 - 16 Dec 2023 12:34PM - Tushti: @27635357978 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
69 - 16 Dec 2023 12:37PM - +27 63 535 7978: She wanted a sponsorship not a scholarship because we can't afford.

22 - 16 Dec 2023 10:43AM - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
23 - 16 Dec 2023 10:46AM - +263 78 109 9698: It is what l want
24 - 16 Dec 2023 10:56AM - Tushti: Alright so Belinda, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction. In about a 100 words, please go ahead, and tell me a bit about yourself: your strengths, your weaknesses, your hobbies, and a detailed description of your family background. Also do share the following details:  1. Your current educational level (O Level/ L5/ U6) and subject combination 2. The course you would like to study and why 3. What do your parents do (their profession) 4. What is your parent‚Äôs highest education level? 5. Do you have any siblings? if yes, what do they do? 6. Who has been financially supporting you for your Education so far 7. Who will be financially supporting your higher education abroad 8.  How much was your per-term fee in school in $? 9. Name of your school and the province in which it is located
25 - 16 Dec 2023 11:07AM - +263 78 109 9698: My name is Belinda MARUFU .I'm the the first born child in a family of three girls.I attended my secondary education at Kwekwe High School in Kwekwe, Midlands Province in Zimbabwe. I wrote 10 subjects at O'level and l passed 7 of them with 5Bs and 2Cs. Then l went to further my studies at the same school and l wrote 3 subjects namely Statistics, Geography and Crop Science this year .I would like to study  a course in agriculture mainly Agribusiness or Agronomist.My father is a foreman whilst my mother is a housewife but mainly focuses on agriculture for family consumption.Both my parents' highest level of education is O'level.My father was supporting me for my education so far and hence continue to do so in the Future as well as abroad.The school fees per term was ranged at 100US per term
26 - 16 Dec 2023 11:51AM - Tushti: Thank you dear
27 - 16 Dec 2023 11:51AM - Tushti: Now, you mentioned you have younger siblings in school. I believe it must be quite challenging for your family to manage to bring up all the kids in a country with rampant inflation, whereby there is a fee hike almost every year. Are they facing such a situation?
28 - 16 Dec 2023 12:07PM - +263 78 109 9698: We are struggling to pay the fees each term
29 - 16 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Tushti: In that case, how would the family manage the finances involved in your higher education abroad?
30 - 16 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Tushti: I would like the parent to come online and answer
30 - 16 Dec 2023 12:13PM - Tushti: I would like the parent to come online and answer
31 - 16 Dec 2023 12:18PM - +263 77 633 3898: Ma'am we are  highly looking for a  scholarship or a bursary so that it can assist us a little bit rest we  can settle for payment plan
32 - 16 Dec 2023 12:27PM - Tushti: @263776333898 let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.  *1. Scholarships* *2. Sponsorships*  Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.  Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.

We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*

52 - 16 Dec 2023 10:20AM - Tushti: Our Academician Mr Piyush visited Zimbabwe in the month of March this year for around 70 days to conduct various workshops for the students regarding the Edoofa Program, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,  While the cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, the cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time.  This means roughly $1100 is spent on just food while the cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, and travelling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year.
