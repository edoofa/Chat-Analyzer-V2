19/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Amazing dear, Let me also add to each video that you watched and help you summarize a few additional insights:
19/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
19/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
19/12/23, 4:37 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Sorry ma'am can l ask something. Is the recommendation letter needed before l fill the form l am told to fill just after the video
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
19/12/23, 4:38 pm - Ashi Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
19/12/23, 4:42 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Yes l agree ma'am
19/12/23, 4:47 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.  May I know if we are on the same page now?
19/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Yes ma'am
19/12/23, 4:53 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by tomorrow 2:30 PM.
19/12/23, 4:54 pm - Ashi Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

19/12/23, 5:07 pm - Ashi Edoofa: Welcome @263787901774
19/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 790 1774: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 6:16 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Q1.
19/12/23, 6:32 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Q2. Firstly, the difference between Rights and Duties is that rights are claims of an individual that are very essential for one's life that are recognized by the society and are due to being a human being with one born with them whereas duties are expectations one is expected to do in a state or community.To add more to the above, rights are not meant to be violated because one is born with them and these rights include right to live, education, shelter and food unlike duties one can refuse his or her duties.Moving on, the difference between Human rights and Civil rights is that human rights are due to being a human being whereas civil rights occur as a result of some human rights being put into law. Civil rights can be found in constitutions or within laws in a particular country. Civil rights protect individuals from discrimination based on race, sex and other characteristics unlike human rights one have them simply being a human.
19/12/23, 6:49 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Q3.The difference between a prosecutor and an attorney is that a prosecutor typically works especially for the government agency most of the times bringing criminal charges and  must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt whereas an attorney represents the person accused of a crime and attempts to maintain the client's innocence. The other difference is that a prosecutor in legal preceedings usually argues in favor of the government and they seek to enforce laws, finding justice through charging and successfully prosecuting the person accused of a crime unlike an attorney represents the defendant , which is the person being accused and it is their legal responsibility to call into question any evidence by the prosecution. These two also have difference in goals for example the goal of the prosecutor is to charge the accused with a specific or multiple crimes that they have been accused of committing whereas an attorney's goal is to defend their clients against criminal charges. Prosecutors and an attorneys can both operate in legal sector but have different roles.

19/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Q4.The branch of law I'm interested in pursuing is criminal law. I chose criminal law because several doors may be opened with a degree in criminal justice. One may  pursue a career in, prisons, law enforcement, judicial systems among other opportunities. I also chose Criminal justice because it is concerned with protecting vulnerable people and groups.. Criminal workers also motivated me because they dedicate themselves daily to prevent crime, conducting thorough investigations and strictly enforcing laws and regulations to keep everyone safe.I thought that criminal justice will be good for me because it helps in making a difference in people's lives Working in the criminal is an excellent way to serve one's community. Working in this sector might mean defending citizens from criminals, assisting victims of crime and ensuring that everyone is treated fairly. Moreso, l also chose Criminal law because it is the only tool civilized communities use to guarantee members safety and the groups continued existence. In addition, the criminal law is the body of legislation that governs the administration of punishments for criminal acts.
19/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Sorry for this one made some errors
19/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 78 790 1774: Q5. There are several skills that l think they can make me to a successful lawyer such as critical thinking, team work, analytical skills, organization, problem solving, attention to detail and good communication. Firstly, the first skill l think is effective in helping me in my career is teamwork. Teamwork is all about creating a collaborative environment at the law firm. Working together enhances efficiency and saves times. Secondly, good communication is also important as many lawyers apply this technique in their jobs on a frequent basis especially in courts. Moreso,another skill is problem solving. This will help me in finding solutions in different circumstances. This will also help me in understanding my clients better and having their issues solved. Moreover, another skill which may help me to be a successful lawyer is my analytical skill.This will help me to figure out some loop holes and also to figure out some false information. They may be physically. In addition, creativity may also help me to be a successful lawyer because this will help to figure out many solutions to solve my problems
