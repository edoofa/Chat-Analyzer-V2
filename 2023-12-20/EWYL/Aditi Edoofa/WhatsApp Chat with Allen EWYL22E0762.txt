Hope you are doing well

Let's begin with our session.💯
03/08/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Good Afternoon Ms Aditi
03/08/23, 2:09 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Let us begin
03/08/23, 2:11 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Now, before we move forward I would like to know more about you!
Would you like to share a quick introduction?
03/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 514 0193: I am Allen Taboka Nyoni. I am a boy aged 19 born on the 2nd of July 2004. I recently finished my Advanced Level and I managed to obtain 8points and my Olevel I passed 8 subjects. I want to study Law in India with the help of Edoofa
03/08/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I am glad to know you.
03/08/23, 2:26 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
03/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 774 7142: My name is Lorraine. I'm the mother to Allen
03/08/23, 2:47 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am pleased to meet you ma'am. I can assure you that being a part of this journey you will see your child's growth as an individual.
03/08/23, 2:52 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Soo may you briefly tell us what The EWYL program is about ?
03/08/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes sure!
03/08/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met
03/08/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
03/08/23, 2:54 pm - Aditi Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
03/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Okay soo the scholarship credits . What is the minimum and maximum amount that an edoofian can obtain
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 77 514 0193: And how do they obtain th3 scholarship credits?
03/08/23, 2:57 pm - Aditi Edoofa: There is no such minimum or maximum limit that a child can earn.
03/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Meaning that I can earn to the point where I can cover all my tuitions fully?
03/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: As I would like to tell you that Edoofa's student Persistence, studying at LPU has earned a 5000$ credit and paid off another fellow Edoofian's fees as well.
03/08/23, 2:59 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes, Allen
03/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 514 0193: Wow 😃

I will be appearing for my Advance Level Examination in (Year):-

Preferred year of Admission:- 
August 2023 or August 2024
29/09/23, 2:27 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay
29/09/23, 2:28 pm - Aditi Edoofa: And #2 – Back to the exciting part- your *Scholarship Credits*. So, here’s a quick recap of what’s the opportunity for you here-
 1. For every student that enrolls in our Edoofa Program and pays the first part of the enrolment fee, you will be awarded *$20 worth of Scholarship credits*.
2. Similarly, upon completing the Admission Formalities of the university à you will be awarded *$30 worth of Scholarship credits*.
3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
29/09/23, 2:33 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay 😃. This is interesting
29/09/23, 2:36 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: -*A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*
  
*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*ALLEN/ADITI/29SEPT23*
29/09/23, 2:38 pm - Aditi Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)

Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay mam
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students
29/09/23, 2:39 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay okay

29/09/23, 2:39 pm - Aditi Edoofa: <Media omitted>
29/09/23, 2:46 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay mam
29/09/23, 2:47 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay well understood
29/09/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
29/09/23, 2:53 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Ohkay okay understood
29/09/23, 2:53 pm - Aditi Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in Zimbabwe, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe.

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually. It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe.

I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.

While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached

Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!
29/09/23, 2:57 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay mam
29/09/23, 3:01 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Today's session ends at this point.
Please be aware that there are no planned meetings on Saturday and Sunday.

Our following meeting is scheduled for *Tuesday* as on Monday on the occasion of Mahatma Gandhi's birth anniversary also known as  India's Father is revered worldwide for his tireless efforts in promoting non-violence and independence.

10/10/23, 2:25 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, they have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. Edoofa has been associated with more than *100 schools*. This includes collaboration with more than _250 Headmasters, Chairman SDC, and Educationists_ who have been part of our long partnership benefitting the students to accomplish their international dream of studying in India.

10/10/23, 2:37 pm - +27 64 621 2214: I have read it and understood
10/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: When the school’s per-term fees are less than $100, we do not get a school call done by Edoofa's Program Director.
The reason behind this is that it is very much doubt that the students from this school will or will not be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education.
So in such a case, we insist that students to forms a WhatsApp where they add me, Mr. Jyotishman, Ms. Deepali, Mr. Abhinav, and the Headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact from that school. After forming the group they:
1) either ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to specifically add those prospective students who will be able to pay around $2000 for their Higher Education. After they add, then tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them
or
2)ask the headmaster/Principal/Person of Contact to share those prospective students' contact details with you, so that you can add them and then educate them about Edoofa. After that, tell them about Edoofa and share the community-building form with them

 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
12/10/23, 2:40 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay okay
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So, may I know if you are aware of these terms?
12/10/23, 2:41 pm - +27 64 621 2214: SEO meaning ?
12/10/23, 2:42 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Okay so *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.
12/10/23, 2:49 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Okay I understand now
12/10/23, 2:49 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Ohhh okay well understood
12/10/23, 2:51 pm - Aditi Edoofa: So here are a few more important points that I would like to share with you regarding the projects.
There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
12/10/23, 2:54 pm - +27 64 621 2214: No limit on the scholarship credits😃
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Yes!
12/10/23, 2:55 pm - +27 64 621 2214: This is wonderful
12/10/23, 2:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Allen, that concludes our initial orientation. I trust that you've gained valuable insights and anticipate that there will be more to come as we progress towards achieving great success.
12/10/23, 3:01 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Yes yes . I’ve gained mam
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - Aditi Edoofa: Good day!
12/10/23, 3:15 pm - +27 64 621 2214: Same to you 😊

During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

15/11/23, 4:56 pm - Aditi Edoofa: WEDNESDAY LESSON OF THE WEEK

Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:
Open Microsoft Excel: Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:
Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities: Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days: In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time: In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time: Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect: In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit: Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity. Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Team EWYL.

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝
