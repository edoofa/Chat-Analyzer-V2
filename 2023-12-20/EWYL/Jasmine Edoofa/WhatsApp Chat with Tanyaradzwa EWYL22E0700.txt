15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 11:00 pm - +263 78 343 6487: Hello Ms Jasmine  it's Tanyaradzwa ,due to my schedule  l can not participate my sessions on Saturday but on Sunday  am free all day .
21/10/23, 5:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening,
I hope everything is going well for you. I understand that your child isn't currently available to begin the "Earn While You Learn" program. However, I'd like to suggest if you could complete the initial orientation part with me today.

Could you let me know if this is possible for you?
23/10/23, 11:18 am - +263 78 343 6487: Hello Ms Jasmine .
It's me Tanyaradzwa , yah you  are correct about my situation  .lam  writing  my final exams the term .
23/10/23, 11:19 am - +263 78 343 6487: But l was thinking if l can do my sessions on the weekends.
30/10/23, 4:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good evening, dear.

Tanyaradzwa, I'm aware that you have your exams, and that's why we've arranged an option where your parents can participate in the initial orientation with me for three days. Once that's completed, you can temporarily pause your sessions until your exams are finished.

Could you please inform me if your parents are available to join the session starting tomorrow from 8:30 am to 9:30 am?
05/11/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 343 6487: +263 773791192 please add my father ma'am.

19/12/23, 12:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon Tanya*
How are you doing today? You know, while I was traveling to the office today, I thought that we were already late to begin our EWYL journey and work on the project, as you were occupied with your exams. So, I was thinking of connecting daily here in your EWYL group.

This way, I can ensure proper guidance and an effective path to work on your project, maximizing scholarship credits. *Therefore, from now on, let us connect at 1:30 pm in the afternoon in your EWYL group to proceed with your EWYL journey*!
May I know will that is okay?
19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 343 6487: It's ok ma'am. Lets start from tomorrow
19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +263 78 343 6487: Have a blessed day.
