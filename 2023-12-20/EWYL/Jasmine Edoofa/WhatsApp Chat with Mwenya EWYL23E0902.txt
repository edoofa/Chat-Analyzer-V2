04/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 761919720: 1. Edoofa offers a guaranteed minimum scholarship of 50%, with the potential for a higher quantum based on academic and extracurricular records. The organization has forged partnerships with top universities in India to secure enhanced scholarships for its students.

Edoofa's approach extends beyond traditional education, incorporating internships and industry-oriented training through live projects and digital internships seamlessly into university curricula. The 'Earn While You Learn Program' empowers students to earn scholarship credits, reducing fees and enabling self-financing for their higher education.

This comprehensive program includes weekly training sessions and mentorship, providing students with valuable 21st-century skills. Graduates exit their programs with degrees, substantial work experience, and without financial burdens, boosting their employability.

Edoofa ensures that its students, upon graduation, maintain a lifelong alumni membership, granting ongoing support and access to opportunities for employment and outplacement in their respective fields.
04/12/23, 9:13 am - +260 761919720: 2. 
Students at Edoofa seize internship opportunities with influential organizations, acquiring international experience. They also engage in voluntary work with inspiring organizations, take on part-time projects, and develop valuable skills during their studies. Their hard work and sustained efforts translate into earning Scholarship Credits, empowering them to self-finance their higher education.
04/12/23, 9:15 am - +260 761919720: 3. To enter the Edoofa Program, a student initiates the process by submitting their application. Following this, they engage in one-on-one counseling sessions with Expert Career Counselors, and parents are encouraged to participate in the discussions.

The next step involves the student undergoing an Eligibility Check Interview with Edoofa Program Directors and Academic Board members. Upon successfully clearing the interview, the student is issued The Letter of Acceptance.

Subsequently, the student collaborates with Edoofa's Admissions team to prepare their Statement of Purpose (SOP) while simultaneously finalizing their university admission. Concurrently, students work closely with Earn While You Learn Mentors to acquire skills and accumulate scholarship credits.

As the journey progresses, the student prepares for travel to India, with visa assistance provided by the Admissions team. The culmination of this process sees our proud Edoofians arriving in India to live their dream of higher education abroad.

For instance, on LinkedIn, you can enter "Education" in the search bar after logging in. Similarly, on Google, you can search for terms like "Small-scale educational companies in African countries." This search will display various websites that might contain information about different companies. We can then review these companies and search for the necessary details using LinkedIn and Google.

If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to ask.
