15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
15/09/23, 4:29 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_. 

Session time will be *Tuesday and Friday* from *12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.
15/09/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I understand

How are you?

Let's begin with our session🥳
22/09/23, 12:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
22/09/23, 1:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I would end the session here and we would like to have the next session on Tuesday in the coming week, till then have a great weekend!

I encourage you to explore our weekly newsletters. These newsletters serve as a direct connection between our founder, Mr. Angad Singh, and all of our fellow Edoofians. It's a powerful medium through which we can learn from his experiences and wisdom. Thank you for your understanding, and I look forward to our session next week.

03/10/23, 12:44 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Good Afternoon ma'am
03/10/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for NAME’s  EWYL journey:
1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Michelle?
03/10/23, 12:46 pm - +263 78 307 7977: It sounds very good
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Michelle will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.
03/10/23, 12:47 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/10/23, 12:48 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
03/10/23, 12:55 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Michelle can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page?
03/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Yes we are
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now there are some basic formalities that you need to follow.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: EWYL Line.vcf (file attached)
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: You have to come on the EWYL Line and say 'Greetings, Ms. Saloni, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Every day you have to come and say *"I am a proud EDOOFIAN'* on the EWYL line.
03/10/23, 12:58 pm - Saloni Edoofa: It serves as a link between each and every student, counselor, mentor, and parent associated with Edoofa. Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.
03/10/23, 1:01 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I understand 🙏
03/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
03/10/23, 1:03 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Once you have done this, do let me know.
03/10/23, 1:11 pm - +263 78 307 7977: I did it .
16/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
I hope you are doing well.

It's been a while since we started our EWYL Journey, and I must say, I am thrilled to be on this journey with you, aiming to reach new heights together and provide you with valuable earning and learning opportunities🍂.

While we are currently in a phase before resuming our EWYL Projects and regular sessions, I want to ensure that both you and your parents stay engaged and excited by sharing weekly updates.
16/10/23, 1:00 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To begin, I would like to share our *weekly newsletter* with you. In this newsletter, Mr. Angad shares his experiences, thoughtful insights, and motivational quotes, and even highlights a student in our Hall of Fame. I encourage you to *read through it and let me know your thoughts and takeaways from the newsletter*. If, for any reason, you are unable to provide feedback, I kindly request that *your parents share their thoughts instead💭*

05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Michelle. I’m happy with your understanding.
05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you. Read it thoroughly as well as with careful details. I assure you- it’s as important as it sounds. After reading it, I want you to share what you understood from it. It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!
05/12/23, 9:33 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
05/12/23, 9:37 am - Saloni Edoofa: After you go through this, I would appreciate it if you can briefly summarize your understanding of it.
05/12/23, 9:43 am - +263 78 307 7977: I have read the document and I understand that it expects one to look for potential companies that can collaborate with Edoofa and that are willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for the Edoofa program 

I've also understood that one needs to understand the company better in terms of it's nature and background
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, let me summarize it for you once!
05/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: 1. _Avoid reaching out to large-scale companies._
2. The company can be _African or Indian_. If the company is Indian then it should have some operation or association in African nations.
3. The _target audience_ of the company should focus on youth. Domains- Ed-Tech, E-Commerce, Gaming, Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics, Media/PR, Food and Beverages, etc.
4. The company should _not_ belong to these particular sectors:
- Manufacturing
- Finance
- Real Estate/Construction
- Energy Solutions
- Cloud services/Business solutions, etc.​
05/12/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright I understand
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.
05/12/23, 9:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay- now here are 2 things I would like to briefly summarize –
1 –  You can use the following form to share the company details with me
*Company Details for Project 1*

08/12/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 307 7977: I understood that this project helps students to have a mindset of identifying opportunities and sharing them openly
08/12/23, 9:28 am - Saloni Edoofa: That’s awesome- Michelle, I’m confident that if you continue to pay attention to the information shared and then respond accordingly, we will make a great team. Now, here are 2 things I’d like to briefly remind you of from the Community Building Project.

3. There is an additional opportunity to earn $5 worth of Scholarship credits by connecting with students to provide clarity to them about the Edoofa Scholarship, which the Edoofa team will share with you!
08/12/23, 10:04 am - +263 78 307 7977: Ok I understand
08/12/23, 10:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 09:00-10:00 AM

Till then, have a great weekend🌺
11/12/23, 7:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How did your weekend go? 

This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *09:00 - 10:00* AM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
11/12/23, 8:38 am - +263 78 307 7977: My weekend went well thank you 

Ok I understand
11/12/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: Have you understood till here?
11/12/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 307 7977: Yes I have
11/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
11/12/23, 9:35 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
11/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Michelle/Saloni/11DEC2023*
11/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
11/12/23, 9:35 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
11/12/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
11/12/23, 9:36 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6). You can do the same thing in Form 5 as well. So, 60+60=120
11/12/23, 9:40 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright I understand
11/12/23, 9:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: Can you share what you have understood from the process?
11/12/23, 9:44 am - +263 78 307 7977: I understood that I have to take the initiative of forming a group where A level students get to be educated about the advantageous opportunities provided by the Edoofa program
11/12/23, 9:47 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
11/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
11/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
11/12/23, 9:48 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥
Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
11/12/23, 9:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:54 am - +263 78 307 7977: Alright
11/12/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me introduce you to the scholarship program that is providing me an opportunity to fulfill all my dreams related to higher education - *EDOOFA -Education For All.*

To give you an insight about Edoofa, it is a scholarship program initiated by *Anhad Edutrain Solutions Pvt. Ltd., INDIA*. Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *a lack of affordability and employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as a mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
11/12/23, 9:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:57 am - +263 78 307 7977: Okay I understand
11/12/23, 10:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: As we wrap up today's session, I'm eager to reconnect with you tomorrow during our EWYL Group meeting from 09:00-10:00 AM! 🌟 Anticipate another engaging and fruitful session. I'm excited about what we'll achieve together. See you there
12/12/23, 9:04 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day,

12/12/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay, that would be great!
12/12/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now, it’s been an interesting conversation with you so far. However, I have some cool things left to share and thus, I think we’re ready to move forward. I’m sharing an audio file below which has an easy yet detailed explanation of the last project. So, let’s follow the same process- you hear it more than once, and then recall it quickly for me!
12/12/23, 9:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 9:56 am - +263 78 307 7977: I've listened to the audio and I understand that the last project expects students to reach out to schools starting with their old school and sharing with them why one joined the Edoofa program and in this project one can set up a meeting with the principal or headmaster and the Edoofa program director
12/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay great, now allow me to recap this project quickly for you in 2 steps:
12/12/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: As a proud edoofian and as a student who is going to go for international higher education, you will connect with various principals on this project.

​​
​After that, you will share in details about the program with the principals and ask them if you can schedule a call with the Edooa program Director so that the students of their school can also achieve the same. 

After the school authorities respond to your message and you can set up our meeting with them, you can ask them about the date and the time when they would be available. Once you get that information, you can send me the school details and the time and date of the meeting via this form.
