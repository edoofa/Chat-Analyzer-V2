▪️Your journey back from Zimbabwe, through your counselors, EWYL Mentor, and then to LPU in the form of a *handwritten note on plain paper with clear handwriting* whose sample I will be sharing with you. The main idea of getting this from you is to inspire hundreds of other edoofians miles away who might think this is an impossible journey.

Once both the things are done, your name will be approved for the $300 plan.

As your mentor, I want you to know that I truly understand the challenges posed by your classes, tests, and other assignments, which can make it difficult for you to attend our calls on weekdays.

In light of this, I'm excited to share some adjustments to our schedule.

1. We'll connect on alternate *Wednesdays through EWYL Group*. This *chat-based format* aims to make our interactions even more accessible, ensuring that you can continue to receive guidance and support conveniently.

2. Additionally, we will now hold our *mentoring calls on alternate Saturdays*. This change should provide you with more flexibility to participate without any added weekday pressure.

11/10/23, 9:10 am - +91 95018 86958: Greetings to you Ma'am

11/10/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So to ensure the same, we are planning that all the students whose forms you will share, will be shown your video *highlighting your journey and experience*. There we would be required to make a short video on the same.
11/10/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case of the absence of video, your forms will not be counseling, due to lack of video and therefore, you will not be considered for the $300 plan.

11/10/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The video has to be entirely about *your journey, starting from the counseling stage till your arrival*. You should share with the student that you paid your enrollment fee after getting eligible for the program and are informed about the cost of education in India before and after the Edoofa Scholarship which is far more affordable as compared to their home country.
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please include:
a) *Your journey so far with the program,*
b) Initial apprehensions that you had during the counseling stage.
c) You highlighted the *importance of being proactive in the counseling session and being transparent with their counselor* and how having these two aspects helped you to be a part of this program and the rest of the process seamlessly.
d) Your* initial feedback on how life is different in India how your basic amenities are cheaper as compared to their homeland* (use the example of Cheap Internet and unlimited calls).
e) Advantages of being an Edoofian as compared to applying by yourselves and struggling with the process. 
f) *Your University experience and how you feel things are different as compared to your home education system.*
11/10/23, 3:40 pm - +91 95018 86958: Noted Ma'am... I will try to include all these points.
11/10/23, 3:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Tell me honestly by what time will you be able to share the video this week?
11/10/23, 3:51 pm - +91 95018 86958: To be honest Ma'am l can share the video after my exams
11/10/23, 3:52 pm - +91 95018 86958: I have a lot to do from my courses...

I hope this message finds you in good spirits. Today, I am delighted to inform you that our lesson will revolve around one of the most celebrated festivals in India - Diwali. This vibrant and joyous occasion holds immense significance in the Indian cultural landscape, and it is essential for us to understand its importance and the profound lessons it imparts.

Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is not merely a festival; it is a celebration of light triumphing over darkness, of good prevailing over evil. During this auspicious time, families come together, homes are adorned with colorful lights and decorations, and the air is filled with laughter and cheer. Diwali is a time of unity, gratitude, and spiritual reflection.

Wishing you all an enlightening and insightful lesson ahead. Let's embark on this learning journey together and celebrate the essence of Diwali as a community.

09/11/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali celebrates the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.🤩

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Celebrate Diwali by lighting Diya's🪔, and capture the moment by snapping a photo of your lit and amazing celebration.🤩 Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.❤️

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

09/11/23, 2:28 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great!
15/11/23, 4:19 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Happy Wednesday! 🌟 Today's wisdom is a powerful reminder that life is a canvas, and you hold the brush. Our theme for this Wednesday is "Mastering Your Circumstances Rather Than Being Mastered by Them."

In the face of challenges and uncertainties, it's crucial to remember that you possess the incredible ability to shape your own destiny. Instead of letting circumstances dictate your path, empower yourself to take control and navigate through them with resilience and determination.

Consider the story of Alex, who transformed adversity into triumph through a mindset of empowerment. His tale serves as inspiration for us all to view challenges as stepping stones, opportunities for growth, and not as roadblocks.

As you go about your day, reflect on how you can embrace a mindset of mastery. What intentional choices can you make to steer your life in the direction you desire? Remember, you are not a passive observer of your circumstances; you are the protagonist of your story.

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights with your fellow students. Let's inspire each other to rise above challenges and strive for greatness.

Wishing you a day filled with empowerment and resilience!

Best,
Team EWYL

08/12/23, 3:52 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Well, since you have now seen your performance table, I would appreciate it if you answer the following questions so that we can discuss our plan of action for December accordingly:
1. You have become eligible for the grant as of November and it is something really big, however, I want to ask you what extraordinary you wish to do for December to sustain where you are and achieve something even bigger?
2. I saw a dream that you would help your family by funding your University fees on your own, but I think you are still behind that and it is the primary goal that I have for you.

09/12/23, 6:59 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello My Proud Edoofian,

I hope this message finds you well. Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

Best regards,
Ms. Saloni Rastogi

13/12/23, 1:44 pm - Saloni Edoofa: What did you learn with her, tell me?
13/12/23, 2:13 pm - +91 95018 86958: She was explaining to us what it means to listen to our mentors. There is a reward after that. She taught us that you can focus on few students who really wish to come to study abroad than to focus on many students who are not ready to come. She taught us to explain the whole story about my journey to someone who wish to come to India so that the student will be able to answer all questions to be asked in Counseling group
13/12/23, 2:14 pm - +91 95018 86958: Another reason is to get the credits into my name.
13/12/23, 2:16 pm - +91 95018 86958: She taught us to keep ourselves busy so that we won't be surprised when exams come, meaning if you keep yourself busy reading daily basis, reading according to your own schedule you will pass, you will be available for EWYL sessions and Webinars.
13/12/23, 2:19 pm - +91 95018 86958: My summary of today's Wisdom

Honesty is a virtue that fosters trust, integrity, and authenticity in both personal and professional relationships. It builds a foundation of transparency and contributes to a positive ethical environment.
The virtue of hard work instills discipline, resilience, and a strong work ethic. It not only enhances individual productivity but also contributes to personal growth, achievement, and the betterment of society as a whole.

Hope you are enjoying your first winter season in India! 🥶

I've received messages from you and other Edoofians at the University, expressing their focus on exam preparations. Considering your likely Christmas celebrations and festive engagements, the team and I thought it would be best to _relieve you from sessions until the end of December_. We plan to *resume our first session of the new year in the first week of January*. 😌
19/12/23, 3:21 pm - Saloni Edoofa: *Every week, I will connect with you for quick updates for 5-10 minutes*. Along with this, *you can share concerns with me Monday to Friday from 06:00-08:00 PM IST if needed🫶🏻*. I'll still be accepting student application forms and African school forms. If you _wish to schedule a one-on-one call for project-related doubts during this time, I'm more than happy to accommodate🫱🏻‍🫲🏼._ I hope you won't waste this time and stay focused on projects. I would appreciate it if you dedicate some time and show productivity during that period.

Best wishes, and enjoy the festive season!
19/12/23, 3:24 pm - +91 95018 86958: Yes Ma'am

19/12/23, 3:24 pm - +91 95018 86958: Thank you so much Ma'am

19/12/23, 3:25 pm - +91 95018 86958: All the best too my Mentor
19/12/23, 3:25 pm - +91 95018 86958: Yes l will continue working on it Ma'am... Together we will reach the goals
19/12/23, 3:26 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Yes Rachael, we will do so!
