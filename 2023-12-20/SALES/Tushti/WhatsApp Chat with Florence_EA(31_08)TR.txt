*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program from your friend and our student.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!
31/08/23, 2:24 pm - +263 71 475 9444: Hello everyone
31/08/23, 2:26 pm - Tushti: It is a pleasure to connect with you today, Florence!

You can address me as Ms. Tushti and we do have Mr Piyush the Senior Academician & Mr Jyotishman, Head of Admissions who will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

Also do note that my working hours are *9:00 to 5 pm CAT Monday to Friday*. Your active participation would be greatly appreciated.
31/08/23, 2:27 pm - Tushti: I would love to add your family members to this group, can you please share their Whatsapp numbers so that I may do so?
31/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 475 9444: l am very glad to be  part of your group  Ms Tushti  
I share the same phone  with  my mom and my father does not have a whatsapp number
31/08/23, 2:36 pm - Tushti: Noted, dear
31/08/23, 2:37 pm - Tushti: Florence, before beginning the session, I'd like to know if you have any knowledge about the Edoofa Scholarship Program
31/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 475 9444: I only know that you help students academically by giving them the best education
31/08/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: That is correct!!
31/08/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: Adding to your knowledge you see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denotes the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
31/08/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 1500 students enrolled in the program just in the last year. We are associated with more than 200 schools with more than 250 Headmaster, Chairman SDC, and Educationists that are associated with EDOOFA. Our associate partner, Mr Shorwi Kawadza, is a reputed Educationalist from Zimbabwe and is the Principal of Hartzell High School. Hartzell High School, Mutare has collaborated with us for the past Four Years from which more than 80 students have enrolled and arrived in India already. The Child of the DEO, Manicaland Sir Abson Mapfumo is a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. United College of Education, Bulawayo the best college in Bulawayo is Associated with EDOOFA, and Respected Sir Adam Luthuli has her daughter enrolled under the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Similarly, the Daughter of Mr.N.M Maposa, Headmaster of Chibuwe High, the son of Ms Christina Rockson, The Principal of Hilltop Christian High School, South Africa, and the child of Mrs. Aleta Makomeke, DEO at Masvingo province are Edoofians and we have many more success stories from St. David's Bonda High, St. Albert’s, Christ Ministries, Advent Hope Academy, Nhowe Mission, Nyazura High, First Class High, etc.
31/08/23, 2:44 pm - Tushti: I feel you too are looking for something like this for yourself so that just like these students you can become independent and start taking a little bit of responsibility towards your higher  education by yourself and help your parents, reduce the financial burden, isn't it?
31/08/23, 2:48 pm - +263 71 475 9444: That's right l am looking for the best education and also l want to help my parents by reducing their financial burden
31/08/23, 2:52 pm - Tushti: Okay so Florence, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 

In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session*- In my experience of interacting with over 5000+ applicants, what I have observed is that an applicant who is able to complete their counseling stage within a day’s span has 93% chance of getting a scholarship between 80% to 100% on tuition and accommodation. 

*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*- You see students have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process.

Having said that, do you think you have what it takes to meet these two significant metrics and get a higher quantum of scholarship?
31/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 475 9444: Yes
31/08/23, 2:56 pm - +263 71 475 9444: I am ready
31/08/23, 3:01 pm - Tushti: Alright so Florence, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.

Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work) since I honestly don't know a lot about you?*
