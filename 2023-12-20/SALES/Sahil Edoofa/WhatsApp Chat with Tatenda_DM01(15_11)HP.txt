15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well please
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
15/11/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.

15/11/23, 6:21 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Thank you
15/11/23, 6:21 pm - Harmehak: So may I know Tatenda better as a student?

How she is at school, her interests and hobbies?

I can see you mentioned her desire to pursue Medicine, what are the subjects that she is currently pursuing?
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Tatenda is a good student, her behaviour is good , she listen to her teachers very well as well as us her parents.she is doing form 5 and she is taking three subjects which is Maths , Chemistry and Biology
15/11/23, 6:25 pm - +263 77 980 3320: She likes to read books
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Mrs Evermore,

She surely seems to be a hardworking and a dedicated student.
15/11/23, 6:26 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
15/11/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes im very confident that she will make it
15/11/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: I am delighted to know that
15/11/23, 6:35 pm - Harmehak: So did you or Tatenda ever happen to research about the requirements for Medicine, Mrs Evermore?
15/11/23, 6:39 pm - +263 77 980 3320: To be honest, i only understand that she should have those mentioned subjects .may you help me about that
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - Harmehak: Oh alright please,

Surely I would assist.

Would you like to add on what really motivates her to go for a career in medicine, Mrs Evermore?
15/11/23, 6:45 pm - +263 77 980 3320: She always says she wants to be a doctor so that she will help the sick  , have a better life .she will also look after us her parents when we grow old .And also help her sibling  to also go further with his studies
15/11/23, 6:47 pm - Harmehak: I can surely see she has a kind heart, Mrs Evermore.
15/11/23, 6:48 pm - Harmehak: May I ask, why she didn't pursue Physics in her A level?

I believe it's a crucial subject, isn't it?
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Thank you
15/11/23, 6:53 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes its a crucial subject ,like i said she  likes to become a doctor that's why she took Biology instead of Physics .she always wanted medicine
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: I can understand
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Harmehak: Well, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 980 3320: I didn't know that
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please.
15/11/23, 6:56 pm - Harmehak: Now, majority of the time Zimbabwean students study subjects as per Zimbabwe's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. *Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology*

2. *Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics*

3. *Bachelor of Science in Microbiology*

4. *Bachelor of Science in Chemistry*

5. *Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology*

6. *Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

7. *Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy*

8. *Bachelor of science in Optometry*
15/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok
15/11/23, 7:01 pm - Harmehak: So far, may I know if you have any queries, Mrs Evermore?
15/11/23, 7:07 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes may i ask , do you offer  scholarship only to  tertiary eduacation .what i mean is , do you also offer scholarship to the students from form 1 to 6 who wants to study here in Zimbabwe.
15/11/23, 7:09 pm - Harmehak: No please, Mrs Evermore.

The scholarship is only for students to pursue Diploma, Graduation, Post Graduation and PhD in India itself.
15/11/23, 7:10 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Its okay , im very thankful to you
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
15/11/23, 7:14 pm - Harmehak: So, did you happen to go through the courses she can opt for?
15/11/23, 7:17 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Let me check again
15/11/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Surely Mrs Evermore.
15/11/23, 7:24 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Im sure if she takes between option 5 and 8  although im not sure about her choice
15/11/23, 7:25 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

Let me brief you about the same so that you can thoroughly discuss with her too.
15/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes its wise to discuss it with her
15/11/23, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: Bachelor of Science in Optometry
*Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
15/11/23, 7:27 pm - Harmehak: We can surely complete the discussion as well,

This would help you have a better clarity and discuss with her later properly.

15/11/23, 7:40 pm - Harmehak: That's completely alright please.
15/11/23, 7:41 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evermore, Now as we proceed ahead, I am sure you might have a question in mind, what exactly are the reasons due to which Edoofa Recommends India as a higher education platform?
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes
15/11/23, 7:45 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

15/11/23, 7:51 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok this is good
15/11/23, 7:52 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Mrs Evermore.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
15/11/23, 7:56 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Sorry may you try to make easier to understand. I didn't get it .im sorry
15/11/23, 7:58 pm - Harmehak: Are you aware of the costs of higher education in India or internationally without any scholarship, Mrs Evermore?
15/11/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes , its very expensive and we can not afford it
15/11/23, 8:02 pm - Harmehak: I can understand please
15/11/23, 8:03 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
15/11/23, 8:05 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Its expensive in Western countries and in India is indeed much lower
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:06 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok that's good
15/11/23, 8:08 pm - Harmehak: I am glad to know that, Mrs Evermore
15/11/23, 8:12 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Its fine.its a very good opportunity
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate please.
15/11/23, 8:13 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evermore, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes its  true
15/11/23, 8:15 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Mrs Evermore?

Along with the opportunity like Earn While You Learn Program!
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes Edoofa is really helping
15/11/23, 8:17 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Edoofa is doing a great job
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

15/11/23, 8:19 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:24 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evermore, So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
15/11/23, 8:27 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 980 3320: I understand
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - Harmehak: So far, are there any queries please, Mrs Evermore?
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 980 3320: No Ms Harmehak
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

15/11/23, 8:33 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Waal its amazing
15/11/23, 8:33 pm - Harmehak: That is great, 

Mrs Evermore, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 10-15 minutes. 

Are you ready?
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes im ready
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evermore, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
15/11/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 980 3320: A lot .it will costs like $1500 or more
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:40 pm - Harmehak: Mrs Evermore, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
15/11/23, 8:41 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Thats  better
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
15/11/23, 8:43 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok i understand
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
15/11/23, 8:51 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 980 3320: I think we did step number 1
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Correct, Mrs Evermore.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok
15/11/23, 9:02 pm - Harmehak: Do go through the video as well, Mrs Evermore.

Please be informed, that Tatenda would be allowed to change the course even after she is accepted and enrolled into the program.
15/11/23, 9:03 pm - +263 77 980 3320: So can  i start chat with her today or tomorrow is it possible
15/11/23, 9:03 pm - Harmehak: You can connect now itself if you wish too.
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 980 3320: I understand Ms Harmehak
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Its okay
15/11/23, 9:04 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful,

So far, are there any queries please?
15/11/23, 9:05 pm - +263 77 980 3320: No
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - +263 77 980 3320: The vedio might take some time to download because im not using Wifi .im using data
15/11/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

Once you have enough data, you can go through it.
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

15/11/23, 9:12 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
16/11/23, 12:46 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Good Morning Everyone

*I am Sahil, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa* , and I trust you are doing well.

First and foremost, allow me to extend my warm congratulations to you for successfully completing stage 1 of the Edoofa Program. I hope your recent session with *Ms.Harmehak* was enlightening and provided you with a deeper understanding of our program. I've been closely reviewing your responses from your counseling session, and I trust you've taken the time to revisit the session with your family members.

Now, as we move forward, I will be your guiding light through the eligibility check stage, ensuring that all your queries and concerns are addressed.
*Are we good to proceed with your eligibility check evaluation now?*
16/11/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Very well and how are you
16/11/23, 12:49 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes we can proceed
16/11/23, 12:53 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I am fine thank you
16/11/23, 12:54 pm - Sahil Edoofa: How did your session  with Ms.Harmehak  go? Were all of your questions effectively addressed by her during the session?
16/11/23, 12:56 pm - +263 77 980 3320: It went well and she addressed all of my questions
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are you in touch with other students from your school who already are part of the program as we have a lot of students from your school .
16/11/23, 1:01 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Have you and your parents had the chance to connect with Mrs. Ruth? Were you able to discuss all your queries and gain insights into her journey with Edoofa? As a single parent of two daughters and a small-scale farmer, how did she successfully manage her responsibilities? Additionally, how did Edoofa assist her in overcoming any challenges she encountered, and what was her experience throughout the process?
16/11/23, 1:03 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes i managed to speak with her through Whatsap and she explained very well.
16/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 980 3320: She told me how Edoofa is helping her twins to study further
16/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Although she couldn't manage to reply my last question maybe due to network or she is busy
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You can call her directly
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
16/11/23, 1:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: so now I would like to ask you a few questions

Are you ready?
16/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Ok
16/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes
16/11/23, 1:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So now can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. What is the country finalized for your child's higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If your child is found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of their enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your provisional offer letter from the Edoofa Academic Board, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalise your university admission and reserve your scholarship seat. This registration fee will be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?

16/11/23, 2:03 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Number 7 : yes
16/11/23, 2:04 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Please are you ready for the same ? Can you please answer using voice notes.
16/11/23, 2:08 pm - +263 77 980 3320: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.

16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 2:24 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:
1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 21st or 22nd November 2023 for $200 and the 21st or 22nd of December for the remaining $150.
2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 21st or 22nd of November 2023.

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
16/11/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Can i discuss this with my husband. And i will come back to you in few minutes
16/11/23, 2:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Yes please
16/11/23, 2:49 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Thank you
16/11/23, 3:36 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Inform me once you are done
16/11/23, 5:36 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Im very sorry Mr Sahil , we dont have that amount
16/11/23, 5:38 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Which amount are you concerned for now ?
16/11/23, 5:39 pm - +263 77 980 3320: To be honest with you. We dont have any amount .we are really struggling with life
16/11/23, 5:41 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Are these dates not suitable for you ?
16/11/23, 5:42 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes sir , next year i have my child who is supposed to go for form 1 enrolment again
16/11/23, 5:42 pm - Sahil Edoofa: Did you manage to discuss everything with your husband ?
16/11/23, 5:43 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes , im sure if has time , he will also answer
16/11/23, 5:44 pm - Sahil Edoofa: But soon or later you have to plan for Tatenda's tertiary education right ?
16/11/23, 5:44 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes that's for sure
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - Sahil Edoofa: So how you planning that  Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
16/11/23, 5:48 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes i agreed .but i thought the scholarship will cover like 100 % .im very sorry about that
16/11/23, 5:52 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I would like you understand from you as parent what plans financially have you done if your don't gets any scholarship ?

21/11/23, 12:47 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I wanted to have a word regarding the formality completion of Tatenda, since you shared with me that because of recent completion of Tatenda's fee formalities it is a bit challenging for you to complete the enrollment formalities within the stipulated timeline. I did happen to discuss the same with the Academic Board and I did get an appropriate solution for the same. so are we good to have a word regarding the same please?
21/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Yes you can go ahead
21/11/23, 1:02 pm - Sahil Edoofa: I did discuss about Tatenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tatenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
21/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 980 3320: Thanks very much for giving our child this opportunity, but can you give us 14 days to be full prepared .we are not employed but we are self employed.
