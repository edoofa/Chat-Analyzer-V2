It's a pleasure to know about them

I can see your parents lead a family that values education.
11/12/23, 3:58 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess they really try to get us educated by all means
11/12/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 438 9968: All the boys in my family are very talented soccer players and my mother has a diploma in business administration

11/12/23, 4:18 pm - Harmehak: Well Tadiwa now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
11/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I believe higher education abroad is a life changing decision as it will give you an opportunity to interact and share ideas with international students. There is nothing more beneficial than being exposed to interaction with people from different countries. I believe my career path requires that. Higher education abroad also helps us to bring back ideas to home countries which allows global connection to make the world one place.
11/12/23, 4:44 pm - Harmehak: Very well put across, Tadiwa.

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
11/12/23, 5:14 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am mentally prepared Ms Harmehak. The passion of wanting to study without financially burdening my parents has  helped me to prepare.
11/12/23, 5:31 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
11/12/23, 6:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yes my family members are aware and they are delighted to support me mentally but financially to  a lesser extent.
11/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate regarding financial aspect, Tadiwa?
11/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 71 438 9968: The total amount of money that my parents earn is not enough to support all the 5 children in our family. My parents encounter a lot of expenses such as school fees, food as well as clothes and other rentals so it becomes difficult for them to support the five of us.
11/12/23, 6:42 pm - Harmehak: I do understand, Tadiwa 

So how are you planning your higher education in India?
11/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: My mother is saving from her salary every month

12/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: And did you thoroughly read the document?
12/12/23, 9:32 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 9:33 am - Harmehak: Well now that you have gone through the document could you please share with me-

1. Your understanding of the Edoofa program?
2. Your understanding of the financial aspect of the program?
12/12/23, 9:37 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa is a program which aims at helping deserving students to study abroad and acquire high education at a very affordable prices and internship programs. It provides students with skills through practical training and the earn while you learn program. It also provides students with career guidance and mentorship.
12/12/23, 9:41 am - +263 71 438 9968: And as for the financial aspect of the program, Edoofa is not a charity organization hence does not offer fully funded scholarships to everyone. It only helps to offer education at lower and affordable prices. However students can be able to fund their education through the earn while you learn program by acquiring scholarship credits which enables them to pay their fees.
12/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: That's great,

I am glad you thoroughly read the document,

So do you understand the following too?
12/12/23, 9:47 am - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 438 9968: I understand Ms Harmehak.
12/12/23, 9:49 am - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you for enlightening me.
12/12/23, 10:01 am - Harmehak: That's great,

Did you happen to discuss everything with your parents too?
12/12/23, 10:03 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did
12/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: What all did you discuss with them, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 71 438 9968: We discussed that India is one of the best country in terms of studying medicine and pharmaceutical or even engineering. Well cultured nation,that accepts everyone from different nations and they will try by all means to get me there. My parents are also eager for me to come they vowed to make ends meet for me to come and pursue my education. My mother also has been doing side hustles besides earning a salary.
12/12/23, 10:14 am - Harmehak: I am glad you had a thorough discussion and they were supportive,

So are they thoroughly willing to support you financially, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. They are willing to support me.
12/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Duly noted please
12/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
12/12/23, 10:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: I understand. Thank you
12/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Pharmacy ?
12/12/23, 10:32 am - +263 71 438 9968: At O level.. I did 11 subjects and i came out with 6As 4Bs and 1 C
At Alevel i took Maths, Physics and Chemistry.
12/12/23, 10:36 am - Harmehak: Duly noted
12/12/23, 10:36 am - +263 71 438 9968: My motivation to do pharmacy is the urge to help others and deliver medication where it is needed. I have seen a lot of my relatives struggling with diseases such as diabetes hence i would like to be the one who helps them access the medication needed. I am a person who also likes to work with patients directly. I have also discovered that i can earn a living from pharmacy which allows me to uplift my family. I also want to be an important member to the community
12/12/23, 10:48 am - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing, Tadiwa, I can see you have a kind heart that only wishes to do well.

On that note, let me brief you about your desired course.

12/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 438 9968: Yess Ms Harmehak. Thank you
12/12/23, 10:49 am - Harmehak: You can go through the same and inform me once done.
12/12/23, 10:56 am - +263 71 438 9968: I am done reading. Thank you
12/12/23, 11:01 am - Harmehak: Alright then Tadiwa, since you have understood the course, can you please tell me, if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself in 5 years and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
12/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 438 9968: In 5 years time, i see myself owning my own pharmacy and having discovered a different type of medication that cures a certain disease which is different from those already discovered. I also see my self as a graduate who has valuable work experience and knowledge who is able to also create opportunities for those that want to follow the same path.
12/12/23, 11:22 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa will enable me to achieve my dreams by creating a favorable environment where i can interact with other students who know better and through high education at an affordable price. It will also help me to acquire the required practical skills through internships and learning
12/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: Edoofa will also enable me to achieve my dream by learning how to help people as they would have helped me also
12/12/23, 11:23 am - +263 71 438 9968: I am sorry Ms Harmehak. My network is a bit slow
12/12/23, 11:25 am - +263 71 438 9968: I also see myself building an all in one pharmacy which caters for the less previledged and having a joint venture with pharmaceutical manufacturers in India who can supply medicines at a cheap price so that the less previlege benefit too
12/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: I understand please
12/12/23, 11:40 am - Harmehak: That is really great Tadiwa, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations!

Now, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
12/12/23, 11:41 am - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you
12/12/23, 11:46 am - +263 71 438 9968: I would want to study abroad because there are better learning facilities and opportunities. My career path deals with interating with different patients from different races and studying abroad will make me familiar with people from different nations. In most cases patients in our country when they need quality healthcare they're flown to India for best medical assistance hence i want to study there. India has top notch equipment and offers the best in healthcare. Even raw material of drugs mostly comes from there.

12/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: Did you thoroughly go through the shared resources, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 12:27 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss. I am still reading the images
12/12/23, 12:28 pm - Harmehak: That's good,

You can inform me once done.
12/12/23, 12:29 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am done Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful,

Did you find the information interesting and helpful, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess I did
12/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
12/12/23, 12:38 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think i am familiar. From the document you gave me yesterday, i think its from $ 8000-$9000 without any scholarship
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Very correct
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
12/12/23, 12:40 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 12:43 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Noted. Thank you
12/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $2000-3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, 

Now *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

What are you thoughts on the same please?
12/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think it is a very good program because it instills a sense of independence by learning while earning. It also gives people an opportunity to study despite their financial situations.
12/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Ms Harmehak,If i may ask despite earning credits are learners allowed to do part time jobs or it is also considered as illegal in the document due to the student visa and not work visa?
12/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: Indeed please
12/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: You cannot work in India on a student visa please.
12/12/23, 1:04 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you
12/12/23, 1:05 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
12/12/23, 1:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss i agree. Cost of living in Zimbabwe is high ans people tend to struggle to make ends meet.
12/12/23, 1:17 pm - Harmehak: Indeed,

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tadiwa?
12/12/23, 1:31 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yes Ms Harmehak. Thank you
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: That's great

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program and how it would be assisting you further.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0


Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

12/12/23, 1:33 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 1:40 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: You're welcome
12/12/23, 1:45 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 1:47 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand.
12/12/23, 1:50 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: I understand please
12/12/23, 1:56 pm - Harmehak: You can inform me once you have gone through.
12/12/23, 1:57 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay
12/12/23, 2:01 pm - Harmehak: Meanwhile, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 2:02 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess i am
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: Tadiwa, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 2:03 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 2:04 pm - +263 71 438 9968: About $1500-$2250
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - Harmehak: You see, Tadiwa, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 2:06 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
12/12/23, 2:07 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okayy thank you
12/12/23, 2:08 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I think so Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 2:09 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 2:11 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Noted. Thank you
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I am done thank you
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - Harmehak: Wonderful
12/12/23, 2:16 pm - +263 71 438 9968: That is fair
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
12/12/23, 2:17 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I understand
12/12/23, 2:19 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yess. Thank you
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
12/12/23, 2:20 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

12/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Thank you Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/12/23, 2:23 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>

12/12/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 438 9968: I'm sorry my network is slow so the videos and images are taking a while to download
12/12/23, 2:26 pm - Harmehak: That's alright please,

You can go through the video once downloaded.
12/12/23, 2:27 pm - Harmehak: Do connect your parents with Mrs Ruth as well.
12/12/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay thank you.
12/12/23, 2:40 pm - Harmehak: You're very welcome please
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/12/23, 2:41 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

13/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 71 438 9968: I went through the video. Thank you Ms Harmehak.
13/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great
13/12/23, 12:04 pm - Harmehak: Okay so Tadiwa, can you tell me:-

1. What is the name of the course which you would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. Through Edoofa in which country would you be pursuing your higher education?

3. What is the average cost for studies in that country without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if found eligible for the program (yearly fee after Edoofa Scholarship)?

5. What is the enrollment fee of the Edoofa Program? 

6. If you are found eligible for the program in how many days you will have to pay the first part of your enrollment fee?

7. After receiving your offer letter from the University, you will have to pay your registration fee in order to finalize your university selection and reserve your scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee would be adjusted in your first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of your first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
13/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 71 438 9968: 1. Pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences
2. India
3. $6000-$8000
4. $2000-$3000
5. $350
6. 7 days
7. Yes
13/12/23, 12:14 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, I am glad you thoroughly followed, Tadiwa.
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - Harmehak: So are your parents willing to support you for the same, Tadiwa?
13/12/23, 12:15 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Yesss they are.
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: So can they acknowledge the same using a voice note in the group?
13/12/23, 12:17 pm - +263 71 438 9968: Okay Ms Harmehak
13/12/23, 12:19 pm - +263 77 330 0932: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
13/12/23, 12:24 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:33 pm - +263 77 330 0932: True, there has to be a clear communication line between the child and parents and support is needed in attaining desired levels for our children. I am well in total support of her endeavors
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Very correct, I am glad you are supportive please.
13/12/23, 12:34 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 20th  or 21st December 2023 for $200 and the  20th  or 21st of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 20th  or 21st December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - +263 77 330 0932: Yes, I am in for the first option.
13/12/23, 12:39 pm - Harmehak: Surely please, Mrs Muchada,

Could you please acknowledge the same using a voice note?
13/12/23, 12:48 pm - +263 77 330 0932: <Media omitted>
13/12/23, 12:48 pm - Harmehak: Received please, Mrs Muchada
13/12/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 330 0932: Thank you.
13/12/23, 12:55 pm - Harmehak: Now that you and Tadiwa have addressed the queries, shall I share the video call interview slots for tomorrow with the Program Director?
13/12/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 330 0932: It is well

13/12/23, 1:01 pm - Harmehak: The available slots are of 9:30 AM CAT and 10:30 AM CAT,

Which slot shall I reserve for you?
13/12/23, 1:01 pm - +263 77 330 0932: P

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

6.supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.
A) NO CHANGE
B) supplement and convert it into gas to use as fuel in electricity production.

Research has shown that the majority of Africans, about 78% or more than 1 billion people have a poor diet. The reasons behind the poor diet of most Africans include recurring droughts, conflict and instability. Among these reasons, the major cause of poor diet is tge stagnant and inefficient farms owned by Africans.
A stagnant farm refers to an area of land where agricultural productivity and production remain unchanged over a period of time without showing significant increase or improvement. A poor diet is defined as unhealthy food which include food high in sufars, saturated with fat or food containing low fibres just to mention a few. 
 The growing of plants and rearing of livestock on stagnant farms has lead to crop failure as well as animal failure. Stagnant farms are usually caused by climate change and environmental degradation. Due to crop failure, there is a rise in food prices and food speculation in Africa which will eventually lead to a poor diet as people may fail to access or buy  healthy food.
 The inefficiency of various farms in Africa are caused by a wide range of factors such as natural disasters and outbreaks of pests and diseases. This leads to disturbance of plant growth as well as livestock death which reduces the amount of nutrients contained in the plant that is supposed to be consumed by Africans, hence leading to a poor diet.
Climate change and human activities such as monoculture, stream bank cultivation, soil erosion and applying toxic chemicals to the soil also lead to farms being inefficient. This results in crop loss which does not only affect farmers' livelihood but also impacts national food security leading to a poor diet in Africa.The other reason for  farms in  African  being stagnant is the lack of basic things such as  access to improved crop varieties, irrigation and fertilizers. Africans tend to use the same old ways of farming which is not wise as they are easily affected by environmental conditions.  This lack of knowledge hinders then from growing crops or foods that are resistant to natural diseases or pests and diseases outbreaks so as to secure food. This also leads to the poor diet experienced by Africans.
 There is also lack of infrastructure and insurance on farms such that there are no improvements noticed in the agricultural activities done there. This is because some farmers may not be able to afford equipments and insurance payments. This also leads to crop amd animal failure which affects food supply such that a poor diet is the inly option left. Africans have poor diet due to lack of remunerative income offered to farmers thereby causing inefficient farms. Remunerative incomes help farmers to compensate for low or erratic rainfall so as to support plant growth thereby insuring food security.
However there are solutions to ensure a healthy diet in Africa. These include land reform programs on stagnant farms, development of infrastructure facilities like electricity, irrigation and transportation. A poor diet can also be eliminated  by a good health care system that provides immunization, oral rehydration, early diagnosis and proper treatment of common illnesses. Africans may have a poor diet but working together towards eliminating this can benefit people globally.

MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY

In a life full of different characters of good and evil, there is always an inspiration behind them. No matter how many times a person fails, there is always someone who inspires them to do anything and motivates them to unleash their maximum potential. My inspirational story is Mother Teresa's story. 
Mother Teresa treated everyone with compassion  and supported them regardless of their religious beliefs or social status, which makes her my greatest inspiration. Mother Teresa's efforts helped millions of people suffering from  diseases, homelessness and starvation. She is my inspiration because I would like to make a difference on Earth as she did, impossible as  it may seem. Mother Teresa once said, 'Love begins by taking care of the closest ones, the ones at home'. This quote has inspired me to help people in my community by assisting them with their chores and offering food or clothes to the less previledged. These little things can make a very big difference in someone's life. Mother Teresa won the Noble Peace Prize due to her incredible organizational skils along with her compassion and love for humanity. This has taught me to love others as well as to show sympathy and generosity to others without selecting among people. Mother Teresa's first miracle in India was when a lady with a large tumor was brought into her care. A religious medal which mother Teresa touched was laid on the woman's stomach and the tumor disappeared. This inspired me to take care of others. I might not be able to heal people but miracles can come in different ways. By taking care of the sick and giving them hope that they will get well, they will feel appreciated and the need to live which may also heal their hearts. Mother Teresa was an Albanian - Indian Catholic nun and the founder of missionaries of charity. She went to all extents to help others which has inspired me to put other's needs forst before my own. Due to this gesture, she inspired me to build a charity home if i am financially stable. 
A lot of people have been inspired by mother Teresa to do good in communities when she built  homes for the dying and unwanted from Calcutta to New York to Albania. She was one of the first people to build a home for people with Aids which clearly showed that she indeed cared for everyone despite their disease or disability. Mother Teresa received several honors but she clearly showed that she wasn't doing good to get these honors but out of the love for humanity. She is admired by many people for her charitable works. I woukd like to be like mother Teresa who helped others and changed the lives of many people. 
In conclusion Mother Teresa is my inspiration because she taught me that the power to change lives lies in us and everyone can do it.
