02/11/23, 11:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Tanatswanashe,


I am *Ms. Pallika*, and I am honored to serve as a Career Counselor at Edoofa. Alongside me, we have *Mr. Austin*, our Senior Career Counsellor, and *Mr. Jyotishman*, our Head of Admissions Officer.


We have received your application for the Edoofa scholarship program as referred by *Neville* from Zimbabwe


As we were flooded with applications earlier, we didn't want to rush your process, so I have managed to reserve a time slot for you at *08:30 AM CAT tomorrow (03/11/2023)*, I would appreciate it if you stay active and connected at the given time for the counseling session so that we can process your application. You can also go through our website( www.edoofa.com ). In case the applicant isn't available, parents can initiate the session. Let me know if you have any challenges with the schedule.

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
06/11/23, 8:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Hi Tanatswanashe, I hope you are in good health.

I was hoping to connect with you and take your application forward to check your eligibility for the Edoofa Scholarship Program as we have discussed your application, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put your application on hold temporarily. However please Note by Tuesday, I would have to submit my final response regarding your application, so failure to get back to me would mean cancellation of your application after which you would have to re-apply  

Feel free to connect with me again, when you think you are ready to proceed further. Below is a video explaining the details of the Edoofa Program
