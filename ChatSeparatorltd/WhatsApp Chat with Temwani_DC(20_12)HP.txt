You can address me as *Ms. Harmehak and we do have with us, Mr. Sahil who is the Senior Career Counselor and Mr. Jyotishman who is the Head of Admissions* and will be evaluating your responses for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.
20/12/23, 9:41 am - +260 761538090: Okay
20/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Now, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries. We receive applications from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Malawi, Uganda, Zambia, Liberia, Kenya, Rwanda, Cameroon, and many more countries. For more than 50,000 applications there are just 5000 scholarship seats which denote the intense competition and the strict eligibility process to find deserving students and *make education, not just affordable and accessible to them but also employability driven so that Edoofians become future leaders in their domains!*
20/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: EDOOFA has commended the new government for its dedicated efforts and positive changes in the education sector, including the elimination of school fees, an increase in the number of teachers, and a focus on protecting vulnerable learners, particularly adolescent girls.
20/12/23, 9:42 am - Harmehak: Eoodfa is proud to support the government in its mission to transform the education sector and achieve sustainable development, aimed at ensuring quality education that is inclusive and equitable for all by 2030.
With the influx of students from Zimbabwe, we recorded more than 1500 students to the program in each of the last two years. Having a strong network and grasp of more than 100 schools with a panel of Headmasters, teachers, parents, and other educators, we now look to replicate our success in Zambia as well where we have already begun enrolling students since the since the last 6 months and we have closed 2023 intake with over 1500 students..


Our strong relationships with educational institutions, such as Penmal Connect Ltd. and Trident College in Zambia, have led to numerous successful outcomes and partnerships with schools including Kamulanga High, Canisius Secondary, Sanjongo Secondary, The Copperbelt University, Chavuma Boarding Secondary, Mutanda Boarding Secondary, Chimwemwe Secondary, National Hillcrest, Matero Boys Secondary, and others. We are also connected with institutions like Njase, Ndola Girls, Fatima Secondary, Torbit, and Zambezi Boarding among others, to provide, expand and build upon the opportunities of the Edoofa Scholarship Program for deserving students throughout Zambia

20/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: *Alright so Temwani, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

And with that a detailed description of your family background, what do your parents do *(Which field do they specifically work in (Profession or Nature of Work)?*, what is their highest education level along with if you have any siblings, please?
20/12/23, 5:07 pm - +260 761538090: I recently completed my High school education this year at Dominican convent secondary school and completed my primary education at Ndola trust school in 2018 . During my school years I had attained a greater passion in Mathematics and business subjects as well as literature in English and enjoy solving problems and challenges even though it is  hard and  putting everything in place and for that I would like to study auditing  , I would say my strengths are being patient, collaborative , problem- solving skills , honest , innovative and attentive and as for my weaknesses I would say I’m not very good at public speaking but I’m getting there each and every day in order to be the best version of my self. I love swimming, reading novels and watching movies and traveling . I am the first born child of  the three children in my family , my mother is a managing director in the marketing department and my father is an accountant. I apologize for the late response
20/12/23, 5:41 pm - Harmehak: Well received and well expressed Temwani, Its a pleasure to know about you and your family!
