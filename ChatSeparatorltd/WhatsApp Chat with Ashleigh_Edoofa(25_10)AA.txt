25/10/23, 7:28 am - +263 78 866 7478: Greetings stuff 
I'm Ashleigh 
The schedule is okay I'll be active
25/10/23, 7:41 am - +263 78 866 7478: 🙏🏽very powerful and motivational
25/10/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: That is well noted
25/10/23, 2:43 pm - Arshita: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
25/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Noted ma'am
25/10/23, 2:45 pm - Arshita: As your evaluation progress, I would like to appreciate your interest in studying abroad, there are only a few who dream of such opportunities with the existing constraints in the country. In this process did you make any prior research on foreign education or applied to any University abroad?
25/10/23, 2:48 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Thank you ma'am 
Yes I applied at Parul university in India
25/10/23, 2:49 pm - Arshita: Have you got the acceptance letter?
25/10/23, 2:50 pm - +263 78 866 7478: No not yet
25/10/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: First of all, the degree shared by Parul Universities are not recognized on a global level, if after spending $3000 for education abroad, degrees are not considered in other countries, would that be a worthwhile investment?
25/10/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: *The most important reason is that the University isn't ranked under the  NIRF ranking under the Ministry of Education of the Government of India!*
25/10/23, 2:50 pm - Arshita: https://www.nirfindia.org/2021/Ranking.html

This is the Official Website of ranking of Colleges and Universities by Ministry of Education under Government of India and you will be surprised to see that Parul University *is not even a part of this ranking*
25/10/23, 2:51 pm - Arshita: I understand ! 
Foreign education is just one challenge in this challenging world. I hope you agree that the major problem that the youth is facing is employability.
We want you to understand the difference between a Scholarship Program that has an end goal of making you individually employment-ready, and agents luring you for University Admissions abroad.
Let me share an article that is part of an awareness initiative for students interested in Studying Abroad.

Do you want me to explain the course in depth?
25/10/23, 3:01 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes ma'am please explain
25/10/23, 3:03 pm - Arshita: *Bachelor of Arts in Political Science* is a 3-year undergraduate program in Arts and Social Science

BA Political Science degree holders, usually, find employment in a variety of sector like Public Service, Media, Education, Social Service, Publishing, Politics etc.
Politics has been one of the sustaining features of governance across civilization.

This course is ideal for students who have an interest in learning the mechanisms of the administrative aspects of a country. The course not just deals with modern political scenarios but also encompasses the history of political development, various political revolutions across the world, thus helping a student learn the Political practices of countries around the world.

After a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science, a student has multiple academic options available in India. A student vying for higher studies can opt for an MA in Political Science which is a Master’s degree in Political Science. A student can also opt for an MA in International Relations.

Other than the traditional MA options, there is the option to pursue studies in Law. Students who wish to study law after graduation in political science have the option of 3 year LLB course which is offered to students after graduation in any stream.

The option to do an MBA is also open for students after BA in Political Science. In MBA too, there are multiple options like MBA in HRM, MBA in Marketing etc.

*Career Prospects*

The students have a lot of BA Political Science job opportunities once they complete this course. Some of the major job profiles are:

*Public Administrator*    
As a Public Administrator, BA Political Science graduates can utilize their knowledge to inform policy decisions and administer those decisions effectively.

*Academician*    
Those who choose to pursue further education can, in turn, become lecturers and professors.

*Archivist*    
A political archivist is responsible for assessing, collecting, processing, organizing, maintaining and preserving important records which possess long term value.

*Correspondent*    
A political correspondent is responsible for relaying important political events primarily for news channels.

But can you pursue international relations without having to study bachelor of arts?
25/10/23, 5:50 pm - Arshita: No, you have to do Bachelors.
25/10/23, 5:50 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Okay noted ma'am

25/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 78 866 7478: If I manage to finish my course in bachelor of arts in political science, I might see myself working for an international organization or think tank in five years. With my education and experience, I would be able to provide valuable insights and contribute to important discussions about global issues. Additionally, as an Edoofian, I would have access to a global community of students and alumni who could provide support and mentorship as I pursue my career goals. Do you think this would be a realistic path for me?
25/10/23, 5:58 pm - Arshita: I am glad that you are willing to work hard for your career.I believe you will be researching more about the course in detail.
 
So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education Platform
May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and the Indian Education System?
25/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 78 866 7478: I'm glad you asked! I have done some research on the Indian education system, and I think it's quite impressive. India has the world's second largest higher education system, with over 50 million students enrolled in various programs. There are over 800 universities in India.  The Indian education system is also very diverse, with programs offered in a wide range of fields and languages.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: Good to know about your understanding.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you why Edoofa recommends India for higher education.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *1. It’s Home to the World’s Second-Largest Higher Education System*- The Indian Education system is the world's second largest Higher Education System with more than 1000+ universities, 39,931 colleges and a capacity of enrolling more than a whopping 20 million students. Higher Education Institutions in India offer courses/degrees that are competitive in the world market in terms of quality but are delivered at one fourth the cost, hence guaranteeing value-for-money education and has led to a robust placement oriented education as about 200 of the Fortune 500 companies hire regularly from Indian campuses.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *2. Its Universities Are Well-Ranked and Climbing*- From politics/law to philosophy and biology to business and media/journalism there’s something for everyone in India’s massive higher education system. Indian education ranges from exposure to the latest advancements of science and technology like Virtual and Augmented Reality, Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Computing to Yoga, Ayurveda, Sanskrit and classical dances.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *3. It’ Affordable*- Compared to many of the world’s finest institutions, India’s low cost of education is a bargain. Additionally, various scholarships, loans, and financial schemes are available to offset the cost.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *4. It’s the fastest growing Economy in the World*- India’s economy continues to surge. Not only do experts predict that it will be the world’s third-largest economy by 2030.India is also well known for Comprehensive Tax System,Business Friendly Laws,Low Operational Costs for Corporates and Industries,Vast trade Network,International Alliances and Work Ethics
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *5.Global Recognition of Indian Education*- Did you know that the CEOs of Google, Microsoft,IBM,Adobe are all Indians? 18 % of doctors in the US are Indians, as are 36 % of the scientists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) are Indians and 34 % of Microsoft employees are Indians as well, all of this is possible because of the education system in India.
25/10/23, 6:02 pm - Arshita: *6 Cultural Harmony and inclusiveness*- India is a country with diversities in Caste,creed,colour,culture,costume,convictions and cuisines.People come from different backgrounds and there is a Unity in this Diversity that makes India Unique. India ranks second in terms of the Number of English Speaking people in the world making India the most preferred destination for higher education for International Students

25/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Wow 
Seems like it's an interesting country
Noted thank you ma'am for the information
25/10/23, 6:08 pm - Arshita: Well I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India.So can you now tell me,How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your career and How do you aim to achieve your career aspirations by studying in India?
25/10/23, 6:11 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Absolutely, studying in India would be an amazing opportunity for me. I think it would have a positive impact on my career for several reasons.

Second, I would have the opportunity to study at some of the best universities in the world, which would be a very great  experience. Finally, it would also allow me to network with other students and professionals from around the world, which could lead to future career opportunities.
25/10/23, 6:11 pm - Arshita: As I can see,you have understood the quality of higher education which Edoofa aims to provide the students so that after completing the Education the student is capable enough to achieve their career aspirations and have a successful career ahead.

By any chance are you familiar with the cost of similar quality higher education for an international student without any scholarship?
25/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 78 866 7478: No I'm not ma'am
25/10/23, 6:13 pm - Arshita: Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth! 

In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc,it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program,the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library,Wifi,Laundry,etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
25/10/23, 6:13 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 6:14 pm - Arshita: Looking at the reduced cost of education, do you feel it is affordable to your family?
25/10/23, 6:21 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes ma'am
25/10/23, 6:21 pm - Arshita: Good to know that! 

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians.Looking at this cost of education also, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits and which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
25/10/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 866 7478: No I don't
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: Let me tell you how Edoofa helps Edoofians bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the
*Earn While You Learn Program*
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
 Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: *Projects with Brands and Companies:* -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: *Recruitment Partners:* -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.
These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: * Webinars:* -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje

25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
25/10/23, 6:24 pm - Arshita: What are your views on the same? Do you think you will be benefiting from the Earn WHile You Learn Program?
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes 
Its very beneficial
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - Arshita: If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $3000 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1800 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $150-$180 a month.
 
*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*
25/10/23, 6:46 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>

25/10/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: Great,Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counselling :
25/10/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: *1. Expert Career Counselling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value.

Here students save upto $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off
25/10/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: *3. Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. Whats more, students earn
25/10/23, 7:06 pm - Arshita: *4 Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker.

26/10/23, 1:44 pm - Arshita: That's completely understandable,

So I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counselling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.
So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
26/10/23, 1:45 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Okay noted 
They're fine with it 
They're actually supporting it
26/10/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: Good to hear that!
26/10/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
26/10/23, 1:45 pm - Arshita: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be

*1) Application Form*

*2) Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

*3) Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes it is
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it. 
Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be* somewhere between $1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even recieving a guarantee to be selected on not*
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:47 pm - Arshita: *So shall I sum up, why and when the enrollment fee is paid?*
26/10/23, 1:50 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes ma'am
26/10/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: The enrollment fee is to be paid if a child is found eligible for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, it includes your

-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team
-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities
-Earn While You Learn Program and training
-University sessions and interactions
-A guaranteed scholarship seat 
-Visa Documentation Assistance 
-The Foster and Care throughout your course
26/10/23, 1:50 pm - Arshita: However , as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein *if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
26/10/23, 1:51 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Okay noted
26/10/23, 1:52 pm - Arshita: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.
 
*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa , then their final university evaluation and Admission would continued. However if the student wouldn’t have met the necessary requirements as per the university and Edoofa , then the paid $350 will be refunded to the parent.
*Amount of credit earned by the student in phase 2 can be used for the student’s first year’s annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
26/10/23, 1:54 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Noted
26/10/23, 1:55 pm - Arshita: <Media omitted>
26/10/23, 1:56 pm - +263 78 866 7478: We are still at stage 1
26/10/23, 1:57 pm - Arshita: Though we are still at stage 1 but we have discussed about eligibility, Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which is stage 4.

In Step 1:Connect with a counsellor- As your counselor, now we are going through the counseling process discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

In Step 2:Eligibility Check- The eligibility check includes the interviews with Academic Board and Test

Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.

We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
26/10/23, 1:59 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Yes ma'am
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *Step 5* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by making a payment of the registration fee within a few weeks.
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
26/10/23, 2:00 pm - Arshita: I hope you are clear with the process.
26/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 78 866 7478: Noted 
Yes I am
26/10/23, 7:17 pm - Arshita: Alright , we have come to the end of your counselling session, now before I guide you for Step 2 which is the Eligibility Check.
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
*1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*
26/10/23, 7:17 pm - Arshita: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experience

07/11/23, 3:20 pm - +263 77 266 0042: Hello Sir its Ashleigh's mother. Hope you are fine. I have gone through the conversations and there are some questions I need to ask . I have seen Ashleigh chose the degree in Political Science. Can she change that because in our country its not a viable programme. Then this is a 50% scholarship . How much are the fees per year?Apart from fees how is the accommodation paid for and the food? I have no full information about the programme. And what do you mean by earn as you learn? Is she suppose to work as she is learning and is she paid? Again when is she supposed to start because she is in  form 5 this year next year she will be in form 6 the she is supposed to start university education in 2025. May you elaborate also about the air ticket fares and other expenses so that we make valid decisions.
07/11/23, 4:08 pm - +263 77 262 2634: Same questions wanted to ask as ashleighs father,  kindly elaborate.
07/11/23, 4:09 pm - +263 77 262 2634: For clarity
07/11/23, 9:16 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
07/11/23, 9:18 pm - Austin: @263772660042 , I hope you have been following the sessions on this platform, as we have covered most of these aspects and let me please re iterate them for a better understanding
07/11/23, 9:18 pm - Austin: Yes, it is possible for her to change the program. @263788667478 , apart from the field of Political Science, are you having other career goals?
07/11/23, 9:20 pm - Austin: Please note that Edoofa Scholarship offers 50-100% scholarship on tuition fees, The final percentage of the scholarship will be decided after the University Sessions of an Edoofian after his/her enrollment. The percentage of scholarships is determined by the following factors

1) Academic Excellence
2) Merit
3) Previous Experiences
4) Recommendations from Edoofa
5) Statement of Purpose(SOP) 
6) Extracurricular Activities

The final percentage will be mentioned in the Offer Letter from the University
07/11/23, 9:21 pm - Austin: *Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester.
This cost can be further reduced by her through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program
07/11/23, 9:21 pm - Austin: Basically, the *Earn While You Learn program* offers Edoofians the opportunity to Earn Scholarship Credits by doing online projects on different platforms. Our students will be given online projects related to Researching, Content writing, Managing and Leading People, Community Building, Digital Marketing and many more. Based on their performance students can Earn Scholarship credits and reduce their fees. This fee will not be physical cash rather it would be reduced from the cost of education directly

All these projects are performed on online platforms and our EWYL mentors will be guiding them. The working hours are flexible and students can invest their free time.
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: Please note that the intakes of 2024 and 2025 are already open for applicants!

There are two important reasons why the 2025 intake has been open now!
1) Zimbabwean students receive the results very late compared to other African Nations. The WAEC results of Ghana, Nigeria and other Western African Nations are declared mid-year. Malawians receive around the same time, Zambians receive the results much earlier compared to Zimbabwe, and students from other nations will be occupying the majority of the scholarship seats.

07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: 2) The other major aspect is a *proper financial preparation as higher Education abroad is an important decision*
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: Early financial planning for tertiary education is crucial for parents for several reasons:

*Cost of Education:* Tertiary education, including college or university, can be expensive. Tuition fees, books, accommodation, and other associated costs can add up significantly. Planning allows parents to save and budget for these expenses, reducing the financial burden when the time comes.

*Time Horizon:* Tertiary education typically takes several years to complete. By starting to save early, parents have a longer time horizon to accumulate the necessary funds.

*Financial Stability:* By planning early, parents can avoid financial stress and debt. Without proper planning, they may have to rely on loans or other high-cost financing options, which can lead to long-term financial challenges. SAVE YOURSELF FROM LOANS

*INTERNSHIPS AND OPPORTUNITIES TO WORK:* Early planning can also involve students participating in projects that will be offered by the EWYL Department of Edoofa after Induction which can help offset the cost of education. These opportunities often have application deadlines, so planning allows parents to take advantage of them.

*Teach Financial Responsibility:* Involving children in the financial planning process can teach them valuable lessons about money management, savings, and responsibility. It helps instill good financial habits from an early age.

*Avoiding Last-Minute Rush:* Delaying financial planning until the last minute can lead to rushed decisions and inadequate savings. Early planning provides a more thoughtful and organized approach.

*Goal Setting:* Setting specific financial goals for education allows parents to track their progress and adjust their savings strategies as needed. It provides a clear roadmap for achieving the desired educational outcomes.

*Peace of Mind:* Knowing that you have a financial plan in place for your child's education can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty and allows parents to focus on other aspects of their child's development without constant worry about funding education.


In conclusion, early financial planning for tertiary education is essential for parents to ensure that they can provide their children with quality education without compromising their own financial stability. It allows for more effective financial management and better opportunities for both parents and students.
07/11/23, 9:23 pm - Austin: If you understand the concept of International Education, the finances that play a major role is not visa fee or flight ticket because visa fee is given once in the whole program and the flight ticket is taken a limited number of times,maybe twice or once,because international students don't often travel back to their country.

They look forward to settling down and making sure education is not hampered.So they learn and do internships at breaks.But still students can definitely visit their family during holidays and spend time with them.

But I personally have seen that students don't travel often,so considering these the traveling fee
(air fare :-around $450,Visa fee:-$83) *is to be borne by the student* which is mostly a one time investment.
07/11/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 266 0042: Well said and clarified. Thank you. Can i have a list of the degrees on offer Sir? And when are the fees to be paid?Can all this  be communicated through the embassy as Well?Where can I get more information from besides online

07/11/23, 9:44 pm - Austin: If we begin the eligibility check stage of Ashleigh tomorrow, it would be of 1-2 days and the due date for her enrollment fee payment will fall towards the end of next week if she qualifies. The cost of education is supposed to be paid in August 2025 and January 2026 , ie in two installments
07/11/23, 9:45 pm - Austin: Please note that the Embassy handles the international affairs between Indian and Zimbabwe. Our students visit the Embassy for visa purpose. You won't practical receive such a detailed communication from Embassy as there are 40000+ Institutions and 3 Million+ organizations in India

07/11/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 266 0042: Noted thank you. I have gone through the list of courses on offer. Are there any points allocated to a given course to allow one to  be ligeble
07/11/23, 9:51 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about your child achieving it

All my questions have been answered
08/11/23, 12:06 pm - Austin: This is well noted, did you manage to discuss as a family regarding the financial aspects and timeframe?
08/11/23, 12:17 pm - +263 77 266 0042: Not yet Sir. There are some areas we are not sure of. We heard about the registration where by you pay $200 then $150. And am I right the other amounts will paid in August 2024 and august 2025. What is not clear is the amount per year  or per semester and the length of each semester. May the financial side be clarified as well and do we have a choice as when we can start paying when we are comfortable after we are made aware of the financial aspects
08/11/23, 12:37 pm - +263 77 266 0042: How about information technology? What's its requirements
08/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 266 0042: And social work?Is it available

10/11/23, 8:00 pm - Austin: Good Evening to you all!
How are you doing?

We are having festival season this side due to which I was a bit occupied
10/11/23, 8:01 pm - Austin: You are right about the enrollment fee which is to paid only if Ashleigh qualifies
10/11/23, 8:03 pm - Austin: Her cost of education is supposed to be paid in two parts, each part before a semester, there are two semesters in a year. The first part is in August 2025 and the second part is in August 2026. This can be paid directly at the University fee counters
10/11/23, 8:05 pm - Austin: *Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fees etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. 
This cost can be further reduced by her through the earnings from the Earn While You Learn program
10/11/23, 8:05 pm - Austin: The duration of each semester is 5 months with a Summer break of 2 months
10/11/23, 8:05 pm - Austin: The enrollment fee is supposed to be paid in 7 days of receiving Acceptance Letter if the child qualifies
10/11/23, 8:06 pm - Austin: We can consider Asheligh's application for Bachelor of Computer Applications but she will have to work hard as this is a different field from the subjects she chose in A level.
10/11/23, 8:07 pm - Austin: We offer Bachelor of Arts in Sociology in Bachelors and Master of Social Work at Masters level
10/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 77 266 0042: Hello Austin. How are you doing? We are all fine. We were wondering why you had gone quiet . It's fine then. So how  much can each instalment be?
10/11/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 266 0042: I think its fine for her to do law  to avoid letting her struggle with areas she did not do during her A level
11/11/23, 4:47 am - +263 77 515 7157: From my own understanding each instalment is half of her total cost of education since he said it can be paid in two equal instalments,so let's say total cost will be $3000,her first instalment can be $1500
11/11/23, 4:48 am - +263 77 515 7157: My thinking as well
11/11/23, 4:50 am - +263 77 515 7157: So if she studies law,will it be international law such that her certificate can be used anywhere around the world when she needs to apply for a job.
11/11/23, 4:52 am - +263 77 515 7157: And also after finishing her studies,can she get a job in India as well or once she is done she has to come back home?
13/11/23, 10:46 am - +263 78 866 7478: Good morning
13/11/23, 10:47 am - +263 77 266 0042: Good morning Sir Austin

14/11/23, 9:03 pm - Austin: I am doing well, hope you are too
14/11/23, 9:03 pm - Austin: Each instalment of the cost of education would be equal. If the cost of education of Ashleigh is $2000 per annum, then each semester would be $1000 each
14/11/23, 9:04 pm - Austin: Indeed and it aligns with the subjects in A level as well as her aspirations
14/11/23, 9:04 pm - Austin: That is correct
14/11/23, 9:05 pm - Austin: There are few courses in the field of Commerce and Law which have similar basics across the Globe but the syllabus varies based on the location where you study the course

Let us take the example of the law. The basics of law are the same if you study from Zimbabwe, India, the USA, the UK etc but vary in terms of the type of laws, economy, governance of a country, etc. Once the student completes the course and wants to practice in a different country, then the BAR Council of the country will evaluate the subjects of the students and there would be an exam which he/she needs to clear after which they can practice law in that country. This procedure is the same if you want to practice it in any country. The Indian law degree is internationally accredited and you can practice Globally
14/11/23, 9:05 pm - Austin: After the studies, she will have the liberty to choose her career, be it to work or do Masters in India or abroad, or to travel back home
15/11/23, 8:14 am - +263 78 866 7478: Morning sir Austin
