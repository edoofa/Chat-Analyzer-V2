She is a wide reader and an inquisitive student who is always ready to seek assistance wherever she is challenged. She is a goal getter who keeps a positive attitude even when the chips are down.

26/10/23, 1:36 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mr. Penwell, as you have shared Tsungirirai wants to pursue medicine or pharmacy, right, Let me tell you that the requirements vary depending on the country Since Medical Education and Engineering are two aspects for which the Indian Education System is known, both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level: Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. If they want to study any Engineering Course, they should have Physics and Mathematics at their A level mandatorily.
26/10/23, 1:39 pm - +263 77 845 9792: Physics for Medicine that means its not possible for her cause she is doing Biology, Chemistry and mathematics
26/10/23, 1:45 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, Since you do not have Physics, I regret to inform you that Tsungirirai is not eligible for Medicine and Pharmacy, but considering your interest there are better courses from the Medical Field itself that Tsungirirai is eligible for and which can help fulfill your dreams of working in this field



*Bachelor of Science in Medical Lab Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*

*Bachelor of Science in Optometry*


Would you like me to explain any of these programs for you? <This message was edited>
26/10/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 845 9792: Thank you
26/10/23, 2:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: May I know which you would like me to explain?
26/10/23, 2:35 pm - +263 77 845 9792: Optometry
26/10/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please let me explain
26/10/23, 2:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Bsc in Optometry is a 4 year course*

Bachelor of Optometry is an undergraduate program concerning eye care. Optometry is the science of eye care including eye examination, diagnosis, treatment and management of diseases and disorders of the visual system. It is a vision care science. Bachelor of Optometry is a four-year course containing three years of learning and a year of internship in clinical experience.

It can also be defined as the science of eye equipment (including lenses and spectacles) aimed at improving the vision of the human eye. This involves removal of all kinds of obstacles of sight which an individual may suffer from. This is a dynamic and challenging career, which allows one to nurse people, achieve personal growth, community respect, job flexibility and financial stability.

The core training and practical exposure offered in the course is designed to prepare eligible candidates for providing competent services in capacities such as Optician, Optometrist, Refractionist and Ophthalmic Assistant. A graduate of this stream can serve the community in urban, semi-urban and rural settings in private, semi-governmental and governmental sectors.

Optics is the branch of science involving the structure, function, and operation of the human eye. Optometrists are health professionals who have specialized in eye care. They deal with eye testing and provide solutions to patients suffering from vision disorders such as partial sight, hereditary vision defects, squint, weakening of eye muscles etc. They suggest alternate vision aids such as spectacles or contact lenses.

They also provide preoperative and postoperative care to individual suffering from cataract. Often optometrists discover eye conditions caused by systemic problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, and refer their patients to other medical doctors.
Since the eye is one of the most important human organs, optometrists are offered a wide range of lucrative career options both in India and abroad, assigned the responsibility of leading others from darkness to light, literally.
