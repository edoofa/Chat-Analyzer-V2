So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
12/10/23, 11:08 am - +263 71 851 7321: No,none if us are aware of the expenses
12/10/23, 11:09 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dumoe, Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

13/10/23, 9:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dumoe, glad to know that it is affordable to your family, So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

And do you know how that is done?
13/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 851 7321: It sounds really interesting and makes things easier for those supporting me
13/10/23, 9:25 am - +263 71 851 7321: I would like to know it is done
13/10/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
13/10/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
13/10/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
13/10/23, 9:36 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

13/10/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

13/10/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/10/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
13/10/23, 9:37 am - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
13/10/23, 9:54 am - +263 71 851 7321: I think it is a great opportunity as it provides work experience before the students finish thier course whilst they earn to fund their education.......Therefore l am 100% sure l will benefit a lot from the EWYL program
13/10/23, 9:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed Dumoe,


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
13/10/23, 9:59 am - +263 71 851 7321: This would really help a lot ...and l fully understand how it works now
13/10/23, 10:00 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Dumoe.
13/10/23, 10:01 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dumoe, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
13/10/23, 10:12 am - +263 71 851 7321: I like the 3. *Higher Education Concierge* in the sense that l am reassured that l wont be alone at any point during the course,seeing that l will be far from home
13/10/23, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*.

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

13/10/23, 10:14 am - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work. However may I know, who will be helping you with the remaining fee, after the Edoofa Scholarship and the Earn While You Learn Program?
13/10/23, 10:19 am - +263 71 851 7321: This is great
13/10/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 851 7321: Sizalobuhke will be helping with the remaining fee
13/10/23, 10:34 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable, Dumoe,

So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
13/10/23, 10:58 am - +263 71 851 7321: I will be definitely discussing with them  after............My family sees studying abroad as an opportunity that will open doors to a brighter future
13/10/23, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: Exactly!!!

Please note that as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
13/10/23, 10:59 am - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
13/10/23, 8:55 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone,
I hope that you are doing well today.


I am here to begin the session, Shall we begin? <This message was edited>
14/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 851 7321: Good afternoon
14/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 851 7321: Yes it is
14/10/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 851 7321: I was experiencing network issues

I am here to begin the session, Shall we begin?
16/10/23, 9:55 am - +263 71 851 7321: Yes..we can begin
16/10/23, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Dumoe, I hope that you have understood what we have previously discussed.
16/10/23, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the discussion, Please note that When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
16/10/23, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*

16/10/23, 10:05 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
16/10/23, 10:07 am - +263 71 851 7321: Yes,l dd understand
16/10/23, 10:07 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!
16/10/23, 10:08 am - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me know this before going through the above information.
16/10/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 851 7321: Its quite a lot of money considering the fact that one is not reay sure whether they will be selected
16/10/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 851 7321: Edoofa has really made things easier and its also takes into consideration what people are going through.....and l believe 350 is affordable comparing to the initial amount
16/10/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 851 7321: Please do explain
16/10/23, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Dumoe
16/10/23, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
16/10/23, 10:15 am - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
16/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 851 7321: This is great because then l will know ukuthi l hv been accepted and it covers a lot of things
16/10/23, 10:22 am - +263 71 851 7321: The payment plan sounds good....and will make things easier for me
16/10/23, 10:22 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Dumoe.
16/10/23, 10:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/10/23, 10:27 am - +263 71 851 7321: We have discussed up to stage 5
16/10/23, 10:28 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Dumoe,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
16/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 71 851 7321: All right ....l understand now 



Please do explain 5 and 6
16/10/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
16/10/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$750) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
16/10/23, 10:35 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.

16/10/23, 10:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dumoe, Please let me know the query.
16/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 851 7321: So the registration fee is 500-750?
16/10/23, 10:46 am - +263 71 851 7321: And will be deducted frm the first year's school fees?
16/10/23, 10:48 am - Pallika Edoofa: Dumoe, Please note that the registration fee($500-$750) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived off from the cost of education.
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2200 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2200-600= $1600

As discussed earlier the cost of education ranges between $2000-$3000 which includes the registration fee too.
16/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 71 851 7321: Sounds good to me...its now clear
16/10/23, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Dumoe.
16/10/23, 10:53 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
16/10/23, 10:53 am - +263 71 851 7321: Thank you for explaining
