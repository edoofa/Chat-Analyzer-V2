04/08/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Indeed, Now, allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when you are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.
04/08/23, 1:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I am dropping a video that will help you know me a little better.

04/08/23, 2:02 pm - +265 883 43 12 87: Yes I did

04/08/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: That is great, So, have you heard of the EWYL Program before? If so, can you provide me with some information about it?

So that I can ensure that we both are on the same page.
04/08/23, 2:19 pm - +265 883 43 12 87: So from what I understand, the EWYL programme is a programme that requires a scholar to be working in order to make some income that will help in paying the school fees for that particular semester. This is all done in the course of learning. That's why it is called Earn While you Learn programme.
04/08/23, 2:19 pm - +265 883 43 12 87: I don't know if it's clear though?😅
04/08/23, 2:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, that’s correct!
The EWYL (Earn While You Learn) Program aims to provide accessible, affordable, and employable higher education. Through this program, you will acquire 21st-century skills, enhancing your employability for future job opportunities. Additionally, you will earn scholarship credits that will help lower your expenses. 

Now, I am delighted to inform you that I have two documents that will provide you with comprehensive information about our program. These documents have been carefully crafted to offer insights into our vision, the courses we offer, and how your entire journey with us will unfold.
04/08/23, 2:26 pm - +265 883 43 12 87: Alright.

Now what you learn through the theory of Wednesday wisdom, you will be implementing the same in our Saturday Activities, these will be simple yet testing tasks that you are required to complete. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the *lesson and activity* on the respective days.
14/08/23, 2:07 pm - +265 883 43 12 87: Noted👍🏽

As we approach a significant day, I wanted to inform you that _*today, August 15th*_, marks *India's 77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳 

*On this occasion, our organization will remain closed to commemorate this historic event.*

Independence Day holds immense significance for India, much like the freedom struggles in African nations. Just as you celebrate your independence with unity and spirit, India too comes alive with patriotic pride, remembering its history of struggle and honoring the sacrifices of its ancestors. Let's appreciate the shared spirit of determination and celebrate this bond of freedom together.

I look forward to hearing your thoughts and insights. Wishing you all a reflective and joyful Independence Day celebration tomorrow! ☺️

29/08/23, 2:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 2:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, there will be *no sessions tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

We are about to start our session in 15 minutes. So are you ready?
31/08/23, 1:15 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: I am ready
31/08/23, 1:22 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, Along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you will also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you.

31/08/23, 1:38 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: Alright
01/09/23, 1:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: This message was deleted
01/09/23, 1:02 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon,* 
I hope you are doing well. 
We are about to start our session in 30 minutes. So are you ready?
08/09/23, 12:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Afternoon*
I hope this message finds you in high spirits. I want to begin by sharing my excitement about the recent orientation program we organized. Meeting all the students in person was a truly delightful experience. It's been a journey of 7-8 months of staying in touch, and finally having the opportunity to meet face-to-face added a whole new dimension to our connection.
_*I can't express how much I'm looking forward to the day when we can meet in person as well. That moment will surely be something special.*_

Now, let's seize the day and dive into our session. Are you all ready?
08/09/23, 12:48 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: I'm ready

11/09/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Today, I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
11/09/23, 1:55 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>

11/09/23, 2:10 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, so very quickly you summarize whatever you learned in the audio for me? Just so we’re on the same page about it.
11/09/23, 2:14 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: The purpose of this project is to help me find the market that I'm interested in at an early stage. My objective is to find those markets that are within my country and region. 

I will also have to create a LinkedIn account to get to these markets. This account will also help me to attain credibility.
11/09/23, 2:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Amazing, thanks Matai. I’m happy with your understanding. So, I am going to share an extremely significant document with you.

It helps me get a sense of how you’re learning with me!

11/09/23, 2:26 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: The nature of the  company has to be either recreational or student centric.

The company scale should be moderate.

The company must also be financially sound.

The company founders must have good reputation and strong background.
11/09/23, 2:26 pm - +265 994 24 34 53: Should I also elaborate on the steps?
11/09/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: No Matai, This is enough. You know what Matai, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.

How are you doing? It has been quite a while since we have had a proper detailed conversation. I am bothered that you will be left behind from the rest of the students so if you are facing any challenges then I would really appreciate it if you come to me and let me know. 

I am here to help you and take out the solution in the best way possible. So, what is actually stopping you from taking one hour in a day out for your sessions? Please feel free to discuss them with me.
17/09/23, 3:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_* @265994243453 @265888314166 
I hope you are in great spirits. Since we have been connected for so long and we haven't recently completed our introduction about the EARN WHILE YOU LEARN PROGRAM.

The session is *scheduled today at 3:30 pm (African Time).* 
May I know if are you available?
19/09/23, 10:50 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?

Monday is a *national holiday* in India as we celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often referred to as the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice continues to inspire people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.

Have you ever heard about the incredible feat of _Felix Baumgartner_, who jumped from the edge of space and landed safely in New Mexico? It's a remarkable testament to human courage and the thirst for exploration. Let's channel that spirit into our week ahead and reach for the stars in our own way! 🚀🌠
*So, are you ready for the session?*
12/10/23, 1:30 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,@265994243453 @265888314166

16/10/23, 8:39 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Matai and Parents* @265994243453 @265888314166 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @265994243453 @265888314166*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Matai*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:53 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Matai* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly. <This message was edited>
