Studying in India is a great experience where students can explore the rich cultural heritage of the country.

*1. Diverse Academic Offerings*: India's education system offers a wide range of courses from modern science and technology to traditional subjects like Yoga and Sanskrit.

*3. Affordable Education*: India's low cost of education, coupled with various financial aid schemes, makes it an affordable option for students.

*4. Growing Economy*: India's rapidly growing and diverse economy, home to several Fortune 500 companies and start-ups, makes it an attractive destination for education and career opportunities.

*5. English Language Advantage*: India's high proficiency in English, with the second-highest number of English-speaking people, makes it a preferred destination for international students.

*6. Globally Recognized Education*: India's education system has produced successful CEOs and professionals in top global companies, with a significant number of Indian doctors and scientists in prestigious organizations like NASA.

26/05/23, 4:40 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *Monday at 8:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

29/05/23, 9:18 am - Gurvinder: Good morning, Dear.
I hope you’re doing well!

Excuse me for the delayed response, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
29/05/23, 9:36 am - +263 71 863 9864: Good morning we may start
29/05/23, 9:47 am - Gurvinder: Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
29/05/23, 9:48 am - +263 71 863 9864: No we are not
29/05/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the cost of a Bachelor's degree from a university *ranges from 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.
29/05/23, 9:51 am - Gurvinder: Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

29/05/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 863 9864: Oh okay
29/05/23, 10:15 am - Gurvinder: In simple words, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

*Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
29/05/23, 10:15 am - +263 71 863 9864: Yes
29/05/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
29/05/23, 10:18 am - Gurvinder: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.

29/05/23, 4:09 pm - Gurvinder: Dear, I was expecting your response, but it seems you are occupied at the moment, so I will have to schedule your session for *tomorrow at 8:30 AM CAT* as my working hours are over for the day.

03/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 267 7749: PETER NDLOVU.🇿🇼

On 19 August 1992, Zimbabwe's🇿🇼 🇿🇼 peter Ndlovu made history by being the first African footballer to play in the English Premier league...
😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳😳

Peter was a trailblazer for Zimbabwe. Alongside Bruce Grobelaar, the forward became the first Zimbabwean to play in the Premier League in the competition’s debut season in 1992. The Bulawayo native had joined Coventry City a year earlier and remained a mainstay with the team until his eventual departure in 1997. In the time elapsed, he scored 39 goals in 176 games.   The youngest Ndlovu brother spent the entirety of his English football career in the Midlands, playing for teams in the first and second divisions. Following his departure from Coventry, the striker enjoyed an equally impressive stint with Birmingham City, embarked on a brief loan spell with Huddersfield Town, and was at his usual prolific best during a later spell at Sheffield United. He finished with more than 300 appearances and 90 goals in English football and spent his later career in South Africa.
