I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
08/09/23, 3:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
15/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 380 5774: How are you.
15/09/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 380 5774: We are very busy
15/09/23, 3:55 pm - +263 77 380 5774: May we communicate end of October
15/09/23, 3:57 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if you are facing any challenges?
15/09/23, 3:59 pm - +263 77 380 5774: Your student is at school
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - +263 77 380 5774: They are not allowed to use cellphones
15/09/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I now have a better understanding of the situation, and I appreciate you providing this information in advance. It's clear that Donnel may face some difficulties in attending our session due to school activities. I kindly request both you and Donnel  to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 380 5774: Right now we at work

18/10/23, 1:02 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings!

I trust this message finds you in good health. In the past few days, there has been some inconsistency in our conversation, which is leading to a delay in our session. *The session was ideally to be completed within 2 days, and most of your peers have already completed their admission process.*

I understand that there might be challenges that led to this inconsistency, and *I would like to inform you that any one of the available family members can be involved in this discussion as well.*

In light of this, the Academic Board has encouraged me to reach out so that we can complete our session on time and not miss out on the *opportunities* that lie in your admission process. Please do let me know if you were able to recieve my message so that we can speed up and move forward with the session.

19/10/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 

I trust this message finds you in good health. I have been eagerly awaiting your response, though it appears my previous messages may have been left unattended despite seeing my message. *Your prolonged absence has had a negative impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity.*

When you initially enrolled in the Edoofa Scholarship Program, you exhibited enthusiasm to embark on this educational journey. *Meanwhile, your peers, who initiated their processes simultaneously, have successfully completed the admission process and are now preparing for their upcoming arrival in India in 2024.* Recognizing this discrepancy, I personally engaged with the Academic Board to explore suitable solutions for your application, given that you're falling behind your peers at this stage. Having said that I am eagerly waiting for your reply.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Donnel!

I am *Mr. Shivjeet, the Admissions Officer at Edoofa.* Over the past several days, we have eagerly awaited your response and active engagement with our admissions team to advance your university admission journey. Unfortunately, despite our unwavering dedication and continuous outreach, we have yet to receive any communication from your side.
21/10/23, 12:53 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand that there might be challenges that have led to this inconsistency, such as students' unavailability due to exams, etc. *Please note that any available family member can be involved in this discussion as well and we can schedule it by the available hours.* However, effective communication is essential for us to assist you in planning your higher education. Your prolonged unavailability or inability to update us on the challenges you're facing suggests that there might be underlying reasons. <This message was edited>
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Regrettably, your extended absence has had an adverse impact on your scholarship application status, potentially jeopardizing your scholarship opportunity. It's crucial that we address this promptly to ensure the best possible outcome. Please be aware that any available family member can be involved in this discussion as well.
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In light of this, the Academic Board has advised me to contact you so that we can ensure our session is completed on time and not miss out on the opportunities presented by your admission process. With that being said, I will be available from 3:00 PM onwards this Monday to conduct our session, provide you with insights about the available opportunities, and address all your concerns.
21/10/23, 12:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Have a great weekend, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
21/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 380 5774: Thank you. May you please be patient with us till end of this coming week. Your scholar will be available .
21/10/23, 12:57 pm - +263 77 380 5774: Myself i am  really occupied.
21/10/23, 1:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: certainly, I understand. I am happy that we get to connect with each other today. However, as much as I would like to proceed further with the session, it is late here and my available hours are ending soon as it is the weekend. So, let us connect on Monday from 3:00 PM onwards. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
23/10/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear parents and Donnel!

I am happy to let you know that I am available to take our session. Please how was your weekend?

20/12/23, 4:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*.

I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better.
