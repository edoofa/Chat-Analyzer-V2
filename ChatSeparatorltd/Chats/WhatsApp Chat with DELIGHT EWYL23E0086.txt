02/08/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Waaal nice. Happy for the kids.

02/08/23, 4:16 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Thank you for the update.
15/09/23, 9:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Morning
I hope you are doing well. You know, in order to proceed with further arrangements like admissions and scholarship credits, every student should complete these initial sessions where we discuss the session outline, credits, and projects. If we put these sessions on hold, you might lag behind.

I understand your situation, and I know you have your exams coming up. I definitely want you to not compromise on your studies and give your best. Therefore, in order to help you and prevent you from falling behind, I am willing to extend my working hours.
15/09/23, 9:36 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am considering two options:

1)  Your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. You can choose your slot.
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 8:30 am to 9:30 am*
OR
*Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday: 1:30 pm to 2:30 pm* 

2) You can attend a session on Saturday yourself. Please be regular because we don't usually have sessions on Saturdays at:
*8:30 am to 9:30 am*

This way, I will be able to mark your attendance, and all your further proceedings will be secure and smooth. Please let me know your thoughts on this.
15/09/23, 11:24 am - +263 77 490 3952: Hi Jasmine, it's delights mother. She didnt take her phone to school because they are not aloud to bring phones at school therefore let me d the sessions on her behalf. You can slaughter me on Monday, Tuesday,,Wednesday between 1:30 to 2: 30 pm. I work as a nurse so mostly will be busy but for those 3 days will try to accomdate you.. Thank you
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Maybe a trial but not sure. Your objective is to assist children who wish to study in India with scholarships and also assist with finding better universities for them
18/09/23, 2:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring that Delight is prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach his/her professional goals. <This message was edited>
18/09/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Well explained , thank you
18/09/23, 2:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of the student’s tuition fees.
18/09/23, 2:39 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Noted with thanks
18/09/23, 2:42 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms.Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students.
18/09/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Thank you. Nice knowing you Ms Sanjana
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, Now she is not online, but she will definitely get back to you once she is online.
18/09/23, 2:45 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: We also have *Ms. Davi*, the *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
18/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Thank you
18/09/23, 2:48 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates Delight to connect with us over a minimum of 4 times a week i.eThe student will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that the students practically execute what they learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
18/09/23, 2:50 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Yaaa of course. Sound interesting
18/09/23, 2:52 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once NAME forms a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 05 minutes should be enough.
18/09/23, 2:54 pm - +263 77 490 3952: You can share the news letter
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 2:57 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
18/09/23, 3:09 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Interesting. Will go through them again, my battery phone is now complaining. My phone might shut down anytime from now
18/09/23, 3:26 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: At this stage, I would like to share with you the _three goals_ I have set for myself for Delight’s  EWYL journey:

1. Make sure that your academic journey is GREAT!✨
2. Ensure you are given enough opportunities to self-finance your higher education here in India!
3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Delight?
18/09/23, 5:38 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Nice. Thank you
19/09/23, 11:08 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning* 
I hope you are in great spirits. *I would like to remind you that you have your session scheduled at 1:30 p.m* So are you ready for the session?
19/09/23, 11:13 am - +263 77 490 3952: Good morning. Yes am ready for the session
19/09/23, 12:50 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
How are you doing?
19/09/23, 2:46 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Am good thanks and you
20/09/23, 1:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Greetings!*
I hope you are doing well. This is to remind you that you have your session today from 1:30 pm onwards. So, are you ready?
05/10/23, 1:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *_Good Afternoon,_*
I hope you are doing well. I would like to tell you that we have been connected for so long but we haven't really finished our introduction. I would kindly suggest you to please connect with me today for 2 hours so that we can move to the next stage. 
Kindly acknowledge and let me know.
05/10/23, 2:02 pm - +263 77 490 3952: How are u. It's okay
05/10/23, 2:03 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. You can take today’s time and go through the document and answer these questions for me. Will that be okay?
05/10/23, 2:04 pm - +263 77 490 3952: It's okay
05/10/23, 2:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 2:08 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Here are the questions
1. Name all three projects.
2. What do you understand from Project 1?
3. What do you understand from Project 2?
4. What do you understand from Project 3?
You can read the document and answer the questions before our session tomorrow. May I know if is it clear?
05/10/23, 2:10 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Clear
05/10/23, 2:11 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how Delight can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-

1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc., and make your mentor trust you fully
I hope we are on the same page.
05/10/23, 2:17 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Yes thank you
05/10/23, 2:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, So now we have completed our introduction of the Earn While You Learn Program.

So, Now there are two options, First of all, I would like to know if Delight is available. If no then, 
1. Either you put your program on hold for now and resume after you have completed your exams
2. Follow the new timetable of meeting me twice a week. 
May I know which one you choose?
06/10/23, 1:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon, 
May I know that are you available for the session now?
06/10/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Sorry am busy at work today.
06/10/23, 1:59 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay and where is Delight?
06/10/23, 2:01 pm - +263 77 490 3952: She is still at school . Finishing writing their examson the 20 th of November . Phones are  not allowed at school so she left hers here at home
06/10/23, 2:01 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, May I know when can I have a 15 minutes conversation with you?
06/10/23, 2:22 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Will come back to you
06/10/23, 3:14 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay Great. Have a nice day ahead!
11/10/23, 1:43 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon,

It is time for the session. Are you ready?
12/10/23, 1:33 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good afternoon,
I trust you're in good health. 

Is it possible for us to commence our session now?
16/10/23, 8:41 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning Delight and Parents* @263774903952 @263776633299 
I trust you're doing well. I'd like to inform you that I understand that you have a lot on your plate with school, but I'd like to extend an invitation to the parents for a session where we will delve into the vision and mission of the EWYL PROGRAM. After this discussion, I'll officially suspend sessions so that the child can concentrate on the upcoming exams. 

I'm wondering if you agree with this plan and if you're available for the sessions today?
18/10/23, 10:55 am - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Morning @263774903952 @263776633299*
It has been a while since we have connnected and I can see that you have not even replied to my above message. I hope everything is alright. 

I would like to tell you that I understand your child is currently immersed in exam preparations, and I fully appreciate your concerns about avoiding distractions for *Delight*.  I hope you recall our previous discussion where we intended to conduct an initial orientation session for parents. Unfortunately, due to time contraints, you were unable to follow that.
18/10/23, 10:56 am - Jasmine Edoofa: In light of the circumstances, I am eager to go the extra mile to ensure that *Delight* remains on par with fellow students. *I'd like to propose scheduling a session with you on Saturday, running from 5:30 pm to 7:30 pm.*
Kindly confirm your availability so that I can arrange the session accordingly.
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Ist okay
18/10/23, 1:06 pm - +263 77 490 3952: It's okay thank you
21/10/23, 5:24 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I hope you are in good health. *IT'S TIME FOR THE SESSION*
May I know are you available?

May I know am I talking to Delight?
21/10/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 490 3952: No. Delight is at school and they don't carry phones to school. You are talking to the mum
21/10/23, 6:06 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Okay, First of all, Allow me to paint a picture of myself, not just in words, but in actions. Since I will be connected to your child for the longest period and I will be their mentor, guide, and friend throughout the journey with the Edoofa Program, I will be connected even when they are here in India. 

I am a seasoned professional with extensive experience in mentoring students, and I possess a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities that arise when studying overseas.

21/10/23, 6:16 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Thank you. It was clear
21/10/23, 6:18 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I hope you did get an idea about me, my goals, and my excitement for this journey with you.
Moving ahead, I'd like to tell you about the EWYL team. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our two key objectives are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
21/10/23, 6:20 pm - +263 77 490 3952: Not sure . Would appreciate your explanation
21/10/23, 6:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the first goal is to ensure that all Edoofians have an equal opportunity to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers.

21/10/23, 7:17 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes, once we finish the initial orientation, we will officially pause Delight's sessions until the exams are over. Is that arrangement acceptable to you?
21/10/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 490 3952: It's okay but at school she doesn't have a garget for her to use for communication unless if you want us to assist in her absence
21/10/23, 7:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So, once she will be back, we will resume the sessions then.
21/10/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 490 3952: It's alright, thank you. Will inform you once she is back home
