But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources, and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*
06/11/23, 2:10 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident for Bernadatte about achieving it

06/11/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 3:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me 

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?

2)How do you aim to make sure that your child achieves her career aspirations from studying in India? <This message was edited>
06/11/23, 3:54 pm - +263 77 503 7058: 1: Indian institutions have proud beyond any reasonable doubt to offer top notch education which positively impact one's life. It doesn't only offer academic breakthroughs, but also shape on integrity of an individual
06/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 503 7058: 2: by keeping constant check ups, prayers and support efforts rendered by the university to help my child. Also ensuring that scholarship rules are adhered to before,  during and after her studies.
06/11/23, 4:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Zhira, Thank you for sharing this, I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing their education, the students can achieve their career goals and have a prosperous career ahead of them.

So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
06/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 77 503 7058: No ,I have no idea
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/11/23, 4:16 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, as per my experience, I can share with you that if a student performs well in his/her evaluation, then the average annual fee for them could be somewhere between $1500-$2300, simply after the Edoofa Scholarship, and even after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.



*So looking at these reduced fees do you feel it is affordable to your family?*
06/11/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes it's affordable especially when she gets the opportunity of Earn while you learn program
06/11/23, 4:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that, Mrs. Zhira,


So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.

06/11/23, 4:46 pm - +263 77 503 7058: That's great news.may you shed More light on the process
06/11/23, 4:47 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Sure, Mrs. Zhira, Let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:

06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-

06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
06/11/23, 4:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think Bernadatte will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*

07/11/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 906 3954: Network is our major challenge and some power cuts during the day

08/11/23, 11:38 am - +263 77 503 7058: Good morning Ms Palika
08/11/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

*“If there is no struggle, there is no progress.” —Frederick Douglass*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
08/11/23, 11:41 am - Pallika Edoofa: How are you doing today, Mrs. Zhira?
08/11/23, 11:42 am - +263 77 503 7058: Yes I'm ready
08/11/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 503 7058: I'm good my dear how are you there
08/11/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: I am also doing great, Mrs. Zhira, Thank you for asking
08/11/23, 11:54 am - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that!!!
08/11/23, 11:55 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Zhira, Continuing our discussion I have explained you about the EWYL Program, If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
08/11/23, 11:58 am - +263 77 503 7058: That's great Ms Palika but I have a question on this EWYL program
08/11/23, 12:00 pm - +263 77 503 7058: What types of jobs which are available for the student.are they within Edoofa premises, let's say at the campus or it's outside the Edoofa program
08/11/23, 12:13 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Zhira, Please note that the EWYL projects are online. In India, international student isn't permitted to do part-time to ensure they focus on education completely. The same is ensured in the Earn While You Learn Program. Just imagine, you having a physical job. You have to travel from your residence and prepare your routine accordingly which would affect your study hours, especially during exams. Now, the Earn While You Lear Program offers projects that are online which you can perform at your residence itself with flexibility in working hours which allows a complete balance between the program and education!
08/11/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 503 7058: That's where my worry was.how would the student balance the studies and the work issue but now I'm answered
08/11/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 503 7058: So you are saying if the student gets the opportunity of EWYL, she will start working before the semester begins
08/11/23, 12:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Exactly, Mrs. Zhira, Once the student gets eligible for the program their EWYL and the admission process will be started.
08/11/23, 12:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Thank you Ms Palika.All the points are quite interesting mostly the fourth point of the higher education concierge
08/11/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on *Higher Education Concierge*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

08/11/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: There is no limit to which a student can earn scholarship credits as it depends upon his/her hard work.
08/11/23, 1:55 pm - +263 77 503 7058: That's great hey.so this amount will reduce his fees
08/11/23, 1:56 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Yes, Mrs. Zhira, These scholarship credits will reduce the tuition fees.
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So, Proceeding further, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how you and your family feel about Bernadatte studying abroad?
08/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 503 7058: This is nice
08/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 503 7058: That's a good idea
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Zhira, I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make Bernadatte's career advance at an even greater pace, as she will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help her in uplifting her family there by herself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to her parents. <This message was edited>
08/11/23, 2:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
08/11/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 503 7058: As a family we feel great and humbled that our daughter being recognized with such big global organization.and we also feel the heavenly touch
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Mrs. Zhira, I understand this feeling of a heavenly touch adds an extra layer of significance to this wonderful achievement.
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
08/11/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes ma'am
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Mrs. Zhira, This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course*
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
08/11/23, 2:24 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
08/11/23, 2:38 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Thank you Ms Palika
08/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 503 7058: I'm getting to know more about Edoofa
08/11/23, 2:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/11/23, 2:59 pm - +263 77 503 7058: We have covered stage 1
08/11/23, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's correct!!!
08/11/23, 3:00 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes ma'am you can go further with the explanations
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5*: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.



*August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.*



This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
08/11/23, 3:14 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
08/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes it's quite clear ma'am
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's great!!!
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -
08/11/23, 5:41 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *1. About the EDOOFA Program and its vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*
*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

09/11/23, 11:59 am - Austin: You are welcome, what else would you like to ask me please?
09/11/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 503 7058: For now I think it's clear.
09/11/23, 12:25 pm - Austin: That is fine, 

May I know your thoughts regarding the financial aspects such as enrollment fees and cost of education, please
09/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Rergading financial issues we have some challenges.Here in Zimbabwe as teachers we are not paid in us dollar.our basic salary is in the local currency only a few allowances in us so it becomes a challenge
09/11/23, 1:19 pm - Austin: I do understand the challenges, Our Senior Academician was in Zimbabwe for 4 months this year and Let me highlight the importance of this opportunity for Zimbabwean students. I want you to think about this situation, where you are studying at UZ. The Tuition fee at UZ ranges from $1000-$1200 per annum with hikes most of the years. The living expenses in Zimbabwe are much more costly than in India. Even the staple diet sadza costs $1 per meal. So you have to spend around $3 per or more per day for meals. A taxi ride for a short distance costs $1, Wi-Fi costs $120 per month, the living rents are high with hikes and the unemployment rates are increasing. Many students work at petrol pumps, markets, selling SIM cards etc after graduation. You might have observed this. All in all, students studying in Zimbabwe have informed us they have to meet an expense of about $3000 or more per annum.
09/11/23, 1:20 pm - Austin: @~📖 At the same time, Edoofians are studying here in India at a cost much less than that of Zimbabwe and even self-sponsoring their education through the Earn While You Learn Program. We also ensure them develop employability skills so that they are job-ready by the time they graduate. I believe you are looking forward to such an opportunity for your child's career, aren't you?
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes sir looking for that opportunity to knock on our child's door
09/11/23, 2:20 pm - Austin: That is good to know!
09/11/23, 2:21 pm - Austin: So in the counselling session, we discussed the importance of Application forms, SOP, and then we have University Sessions, the Earn While You Learn Program, visa assistance, and all services for which the cost is cut down making the enrollment fee reduced to $350 which can be paid either in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining $150 in 30 days) or together

If Bernadette is found eligible for the program, are you in a position to raise the enrollment fee within 7 days after receiving the Acceptance Letter?
09/11/23, 2:27 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Maybe in two phases.200 in 7days then 150 in 30days
09/11/23, 2:27 pm - Austin: This is well noted!
09/11/23, 2:30 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Thank you
09/11/23, 2:37 pm - Austin: As you know, form 6 students are currently occupied with lessons and exam preparations due to which they are unavailable now. When you compare this with the Western African Countries students will be available with results much earlier than Zimbabweans, and there is a high chance that the scholarship seats would be occupied by them which in turn would be a loss for Zimbabwean students. At the same time, the day scholars in Zimbabwe are still applying and clearing the tests. 

All these factors have been a disadvantage for the boarding students and specifically the students who aren't supposed to use their devices in School. By the time they are back, the opportunity might be vacated by other applicants. This is the reason why our Academic Board along with the discussion with Universities has decided to allow parents to take part in the seat reservation interview for their children so that no deserving applicant is missed out. 

*So are you willing to take up the Seat Reservation Interview call for Bernadette?*
09/11/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes sir I can do the interview on her behalf
09/11/23, 2:40 pm - Austin: I appreciate your willingness!
09/11/23, 2:41 pm - Austin: Can you tell me,

1. What is the name of the course that your child would be studying through the Edoofa Program?

2. In which country will she be studying through the Edoofa program?

3. What is the average cost of studies in India without a scholarship?

4. What is the annual fee you will pay if your child is found eligible for the program?

5. After receiving the offer letter from the University, you will have to pay the registration fee in order to finalize your child’s university selection and reserve the scholarship seat in a particular university, this registration fee will be adjusted in the first year's annual fee, therefore, it is a part of the first year's annual fee after scholarship. Are you clear about the same?
09/11/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 503 7058: 1 BBA
2 India
3 $6000-8000
4 $2000 - 3000
5-Its clear sir
09/11/23, 2:53 pm - Austin: Good Work!

09/11/23, 3:00 pm - Austin: I understand and at what time do you think you will be available?

14/11/23, 1:42 pm - Austin: The visa process takes place 1-2 months prior to the intake
14/11/23, 1:43 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Ok thank you mr Austin

14/11/23, 1:45 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Thank you,and the rest with Edoofa?
14/11/23, 1:47 pm - Austin: Let me please help you with the financial aspects of the program. 

*Cost of education*
The cost of education is reduced from $6000-$8000 to $2000-$3000 per annum which includes Tuition fees, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library fee etc. It is paid in two equal instalments, each instalment before a semester. Your intake is in August 2023
This cost can be further reduced by her through the earnings from Earn While You Learn program

*Enrollment fee*
For all the services and assistance including Applications to Universities, Statement of Purpose, Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection and sessions, Earn While you Learn program and training, etc all you have is $350 which can either be paid in two phases($200 in 7 days and remaining within the next 30 days) or together
14/11/23, 1:48 pm - Austin: *Registration Fee*
The registration fee($500-$1000) is to be paid after you receive the Offer letter from University after the University sessions and then you receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. 

*The registration fee isn't an additional fee as it is waived from the cost of education.*
 
For example, if your cost of education after the scholarship is $2000 per annum and the registration fee is $600, then while you are in India you need to pay only the remaining amount which is $2000-600= $1400

The cost of transportation and visa application is catered by a student's family <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 1:56 pm - +263 77 503 7058: So currently as parents we are supposed to pay 350 for enrollment fee
14/11/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Then after that we pay registration fee which amounts from 500-750us
14/11/23, 1:58 pm - +263 77 503 7058: So we are looking at something like + 0r - $1000us to complete the registration process
14/11/23, 1:59 pm - Austin: That is right, you can pay the enrollment fee in two phases as mentioned with a total timeframe of 37 days
14/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 77 503 7058: On the last part of this, usually how much is needed for the transport cost
14/11/23, 2:01 pm - Austin: The registration fee is supposed to be paid after you receive Offer Letters from Universities and our Admissions team will be discussing the timeframe and will guide you with payment plans to lessen the financial pressure
14/11/23, 2:01 pm - Austin: That is right, this registration fee is a part of the cost of education itself due to which it isn't an addition fees <This message was edited>
14/11/23, 2:02 pm - Austin: The airfare from Zimbabwe to India is around $450
14/11/23, 2:26 pm - +263 77 503 7058: It's ok . thank you Mr Austin
14/11/23, 3:58 pm - Austin: You are most welcome, I have been caught up at a Board meeting
14/11/23, 3:58 pm - Austin: Are you having any questions for me please?
14/11/23, 5:06 pm - +263 77 503 7058: It's ok no problem
14/11/23, 5:07 pm - +263 77 503 7058: For now I'm answered, will come back to you if any question arise
14/11/23, 5:35 pm - Austin: Sure, that would be fine
14/11/23, 5:36 pm - Austin: I see you had a concern, what is Bernadette doesn't meet academic requriements
14/11/23, 5:36 pm - Austin: Are you aware of the minimum academic criteria to qualify for the program?
14/11/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes you said 6 points
14/11/23, 5:42 pm - Austin: I want to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the COVID, the minimum points required was 6 points to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the pandemic, the Government realized that not all students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are from a privileged background to afford a private high school, tuition, resources and online lessons. To help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and *as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, we always encourage students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about Bernadette achieving it
14/11/23, 8:42 pm - Austin: May I know, is it clear please, @263779063954 @263775037058 ?
14/11/23, 8:55 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Yes it's clear Mr Austin.thank you
14/11/23, 9:09 pm - Austin: You are welcome!
14/11/23, 9:09 pm - Austin: Even if Edoofians fail to meet the requirements, they have a positive path ahead. If a student qualifies as a deserving student for the Edoofa scholarship we believe that he/she has the calibre to meet the grades, so in case they fail to meet them, even then the eligibility will be valid, and students can write the exams again, gain minimum points and can join the intake. With the right needs and resources students will give their best to perform well.
14/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 77 503 7058: That's great hey
14/11/23, 9:13 pm - +263 77 503 7058: The other problem with us Mr Austin is of the funds.the 350 which is needed now for enrollment and the registration soon
14/11/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 503 7058: Remember we are still paying Bernadette 'A level fees.not her only,we have other 2 daughters who need school fees again
14/11/23, 9:25 pm - Austin: I do understand Mrs Zhira, you receive a timeframe of 37 days in total to pay the enrollment fees and our Admissions Team will discuss the University sessions only after discussing the tentative timelines and payment plans with you to ensure the ease of financial stress on you
14/11/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 503 7058: I'm hearing you my dear but in 37 days I only receive one salary and I once mentioned that it's in local currency which is weaker than us dollar.so l have to buy us dollar on black market and the exchange rates are so high
14/11/23, 9:35 pm - Austin: I am well aware the hyperinflation is Zimbabwe, Mrs Zhira and this is one of the major reason, students and families are trying their best to opt for Edoofa Scholarship Program
20/12/23, 8:43 pm - The group's settings have changed to allow only admins to add others to this group.
