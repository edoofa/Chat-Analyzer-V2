13/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you so much for sharing the documents with me, it is well noted by the admission team. We are ready and excited to commence your academic journey for the year 2024. 

To proceed with our discussion, I would like to enquire whether you remember our past discussion about your admission procedure. I am attaching the image of the 6 steps so that you might recall the procedure.
13/09/23, 3:35 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
13/09/23, 3:57 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Step 6 is of visa application . Which the edoofa will assist with document Admission Acceptance letter and just pay a few amount
13/09/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: According to the above steps we have competed up to step 3 and now we shall commence with the following steps. Shall we proceed with the session?
13/09/23, 4:17 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
13/09/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that you have comprehended the university admission process. As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
13/09/23, 4:24 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes we completed step 3  and  waiting for step 4
13/09/23, 4:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 224 1615: This message was deleted
13/09/23, 4:55 pm - +263 77 224 1615: May you elaborate
13/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Kindly excuse me for the late reply, our available hours for the first slot have just ended.
13/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.
13/09/23, 7:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For your clarity let me explain it to you with an example. Say your Registration fee is $750, out of that $150 would be borne by Edoofa, which means effectively the Registration fee which you have to pay would be $600, and now this $600 could be paid in 2 installments within 30 to 45 days.
 
As Edoofa gave you the word that throughout your higher education, we would be here to help you financially plan for your journey ahead. I believe this would relieve your parents a lot in terms of financial constraints itself. Isn't it?
13/09/23, 7:40 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok noted
13/09/23, 7:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing to hear that, do you wish to know more about the Early Decision Benefits as well as the $150 Grant?
13/09/23, 7:46 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
13/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know, so, for the past few years, we have noticed that the students from West Africa always get an advantage over the students from other parts of Africa because their exam results are out earlier and they complete their Admission Formalities by January and take the advantage of Early Scholarship Seats. Were you aware of that?
13/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 224 1615: No
13/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024. Let me brief you about the Early Decision benefits:

1. Gain Early Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Preserve your university fee structure based on the current batch of admissions.

3. Avail an Early Decision Grant of $150 on the registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
13/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, choosing the early decision benefits brings two additional advantages:
13/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able admission for the 2025 intake.

2. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

3. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
13/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
13/09/23, 7:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
13/09/23, 7:53 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes i have gone through them
13/09/23, 8:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Before we proceed further, would you be able to share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. A-Level Result/Letter of Recommendation/Statement of Entry (A-Level).*

*2. O-Level Results*

*3. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*

13/09/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Step 3 the Edoofa board  will share recommendations to various universities. I so remember that various acceptance letter may be offered and to choose 1 from those
13/09/23, 9:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, I have a piece of exciting news to share with you that will help you and your family alleviate some of the financial strain associated with your higher education costs.

This news is directly linked to students like you who are currently navigating their admission process and brings advantages of the early decision for those who opt to finalize their admission in the month of September. Have you been made aware of this opportunity?
13/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Not sure  tell me the exciting news
13/09/23, 9:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand, it is alright, let me brief you on the same. So, basically, under this opportunity, the student's admission process is fast-tracked after which the student receives his/her Offer Letters from the University within 3 to 4 working days. However, the benefit they get from this is whatever their registration fee would be, out of that $150 would be paid by Edoofa towards reserving a seat in the university.

14/09/23, 8:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?

14/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad you are aware of that now. Considering that, we came up with a solution to help the students from other African countries like Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana, Malawi, Cameroon, etc. with an Early Scholarship Grant for 2024 Admission since their A-Level results will be out by the month of February 2024.

*The student will be eligible for the guaranteed earnings under the EWYL program by completing one year under the program*
14/09/23, 8:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Pleasee lt me know once you have gone through these benefits so that we can discuss all of them one by one.
14/09/23, 8:56 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes I gone through them
14/09/23, 9:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Let's now discuss the Early Decision Benefits:
14/09/23, 9:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. As you await your A-Level results, initiating the university admission process now positions you as an early applicant. This status comes with the advantage of receiving a provisional letter of intent from the university. This letter will outline your scholarship percentage and associated fees. Once you complete your registration formalities and your results are available, you'll be provided with your Official Admission Letter. This letter will enable you to proceed with your student visa application. I trust this point is now clear to you.
14/09/23, 9:30 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. I'm delighted to share this with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Students now have the reamrkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This can be achieved by making an early decision to initiate the university admission process and securing your seat in advance. By taking this step, you can avail the early decision benefits previously mentioned. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/09/23, 9:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 9:42 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 3. I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
14/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be skillfully adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/09/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes noted
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 4. I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, we're offering the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
14/09/23, 10:04 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for September 18, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before September 18, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by October 18, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
14/09/23, 10:11 pm - +263 77 224 1615: It seems you said registration should be paid within 30_45 days  in two parts
14/09/23, 10:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is correct.
14/09/23, 10:20 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Okay noted
15/09/23, 7:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents Juliet. I hope you are well and blessed. May I know if you are ready to further proceed with the session?
15/09/23, 7:36 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Am okay how are you. ready
15/09/23, 7:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. With further continuation.
15/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
15/09/23, 7:41 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Not aware with the process .
15/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely, let me help you with this. When a student decides to initiate their admission process before receiving their A-Level results, they gain the advantage of early registration benefits. At this stage, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from entities like Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship percentage as promised.
15/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there might be a scenario where the student might not achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels. 

In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship. However, if a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university with early decision benefits, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged.
15/09/23, 7:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: On the other hand, if a student manages to achieve a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application once the results are available. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship.I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how this gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process as per the standard procedures?
15/09/23, 8:04 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok noted thanks for update
15/09/23, 8:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now that you are clear that a student needs to get a minimum of 2 E grades to pursue their higher education in India. To help you understand the remaining three points, let us say, a students fails to get at least two A Level Passes (or 2 E Grades) in their exams, this means that based on this set of results, they won't be able to pursue their bachelor's education anywhere in the world, right?
15/09/23, 8:25 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Noted
15/09/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is indeed correct, I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
15/09/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes i agree
15/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

1. Reappear in A Level

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
15/09/23, 9:03 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the early decision benefits, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for  another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
15/09/23, 9:07 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
15/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
15/09/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
15/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes it's clear
15/09/23, 9:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
15/09/23, 9:43 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I have read and understand that clear
15/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, I would like you to go through all 7 points again and let me know if you have any doubts or queries related to the same, and if you do not have any queries we can then proceed forward. So, are these 7 points clear?
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes they are clear
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Let's proceed
15/09/23, 9:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright, I’m glad to know that you have understood all of this well! Now, I would like you to take some time and have a discussion with your family concerning the next steps in your university admission journey and update them about the benefits of the early decision. I am sure they would be excited and open to the same opportunity. And we shall connect on Monday at 7:30 PM. Have a great weekend.
15/09/23, 9:49 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Thank you same to you
18/09/23, 7:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Juliet,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. Please, how was your weekend?
18/09/23, 7:34 pm - +263 77 224 1615: The weekend was okay what about yours
18/09/23, 7:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. It was good too, thank you for asking. Could you let me know if you're available to continue the session at any time now?
18/09/23, 7:43 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes available
18/09/23, 7:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm pleased to learn that. Mr. Crispen, I'm interested in knowing whether you've had the opportunity to engage in a conversation regarding the advantages of early decision, as we touched upon the previous day..
18/09/23, 7:47 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
18/09/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 224 1615: The seat is reserved and and even reappear in A-Level..
18/09/23, 8:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Great! It is good to know all of us are on the same page. I hope you are aware that the next step for students is to start with their university admission process and that is only done after their parents give us the go-ahead and share that they are mentally and financially prepared for their child's next steps.*
18/09/23, 9:17 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes  let's continue
18/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that.  After they do that and we get a go-ahead from their end, we will be sharing the student’s application with the universities that are applicable for his/her course and are recommended by the Edoofa academic board for a scholarship. 

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send him/her a scholarship offer letter.

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due date will be mentioned.
18/09/23, 9:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *In order to reserve/lock a student's seat with the university, one has to pay the Registration Fee of $500 to $750 which is a part of their first-year educational expenses of $2000 to $3000. May I ask if we both are on the same page here and if you recall the same?*
18/09/23, 9:35 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
18/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is amazing to hear. Alright, please. Now, before we discuss more on the registration fee and when it is to be paid, I would first like you to understand the importance of the deadlines which are given by the universities for the registration fee due and the action the university takes against a student if they miss the same.
18/09/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Keeping in mind the number of applications universities receive for scholarships and the limited number of seats, they have to be fair to each and every student, and each student is only given the opportunity once to reserve their seat with the university. If one fails to pay the registration fee by the deadline given by the university, the offer letter is revoked by the university and then they can’t be admitted into that particular university for the current academic year, meaning the Universities are very strict with their deadlines for the registration fee.
18/09/23, 9:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In order to avoid this, we ensure to always keep our students well informed of the finances so that they start preparing early. At the same time, we have a conversation with the students and their guardians/sponsors to understand their financial preparation better and to help them plan the same. 

Once they give us the go-ahead that they are mentally and financially prepared to pay the fee as per the deadlines shared with them, only then we move forward with the admission process and share their application with the universities. Are you clear on this?
19/09/23, 8:07 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes prepared
19/09/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Juliet,

I trust this message finds you in good health and spirits. I was not able to connect with you as I was occupied with retrieving our proud Edooﬁans from the airport. I would like to share a glimpse of this experience with my students. Along with that, I would like to reschedule our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM. I hope this timing works for you. Have a great day!
19/09/23, 6:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/09/23, 7:16 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Hoo happy for them
20/09/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon! I trust this message finds you in good health and high spirits. How are you enjoying this lovely afternoon?
20/09/23, 3:33 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes enjoying
20/09/23, 3:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Are you prepared and ready for our session? <This message was edited>
20/09/23, 4:51 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
20/09/23, 4:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great. Now you have two ways to proceed with your child’s university admission process -

*1. Proceed as per the standard procedures*
*2. Proceed with the Early Decision Benefits*

Be assured that I will help you understand the difference between both of them so that you can make a well-informed decision regarding your child’s university admission process. Shall we start with our discussion regarding the same?
20/09/23, 5:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected?
20/09/23, 6:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today and  I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
20/09/23, 8:40 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Can you explain 1 . sorry my network was bad the whole day
21/09/23, 2:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon, parents and my dear student.

How is your afternoon going?
21/09/23, 3:18 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Am okay how are you
21/09/23, 3:24 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
21/09/23, 3:32 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes but you don't explain the standard procedures
21/09/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Surely we will come to that.
21/09/23, 3:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: let us start with the *Standard Registration/University Admission process*-

As you are aware that one’s registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university, to be on the safer side, let us assume that the registration fee is $750 itself.

As per the standard procedures, once you get the offer letter from the university, you will be given a period of 15 days to make the payment of your complete registration fee of $750.

For example, if you get the offer letter on the 23rd of September and you are given 15 days to make the payment of your fee, the deadline for the registration fee would be the 9th of October 2023 and you would have to make the payment of the fee before then. Are you clear about this?
21/09/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I was not able to connect with you today. Hence, I'll be wrapping up our discussion for now as I need to connect with another batch of my students. To continue our conversation, I propose scheduling our session for tomorrow at 3:00 PM.

Wishing you a fantastic day, and please extend my warm regards to your wonderful family too.
21/09/23, 6:47 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Noted
21/09/23, 6:48 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Same to you
22/09/23, 7:41 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good evening, dear parents and my dear student,

I hope this message finds you well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for not being able to connect with you at our scheduled time today. I was currently occupied with a meeting with the admission team. So, I will connect with you on Monday at 3:00 PM. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your family as well.
22/09/23, 10:12 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Noted thank you
25/09/23, 2:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon.

As we embark on a fresh new week, how are you doing this lovely afternoon?
25/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I'm okay what about you
25/09/23, 3:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am doing well too. Thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with our session for your admission process?
25/09/23, 3:24 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
25/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Great, now let us discuss the *Early Registration/University Admission process -*

As the name states, a student is eligible for the early decision benefits if he/she makes the decision to proceed with their university admission process early.

If you do that, you are eligible for all 6 benefits that we discussed earlier. Since the benefit number 3 and 4 helps you ease the registration process, I will be discussing the same in particular and help you understand how that happens -

When we talk about the Early Decision Grant of $150 (benefit number 3)
25/09/23, 3:55 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To understand the same, let us once again assume that the registration fee due is $750 and if you have a grant of $150, this means that out of the fee due of $750, $150 will be paid by the Edoofa Academic Board on your behalf and hence this leaves your child’s fee due as $750 - $150 = $600.

So, the amount that you will have to pay to reserve/lock your child’s scholarship seat becomes $60
25/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Along with this, you also have a payment plan to pay the $600 (benefit number 4), Since the fee due is $600 after the grant, you can make the payment of $600 in two parts as below -

*1. The first part ~ $300* is to be paid within 15 days of when you get the offer letter. (Say if you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, the deadline becomes the 14th of October, 2023)

*2. The second part ~ $300* is to be paid within one month from the deadline for the first part of the fee. (Let’s say you get the offer letter on the 30th of September, and so the first deadline becomes the 14th of October 2023, making the second deadline the 14th of November, 2023).
25/09/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Noted thanks
25/09/23, 5:25 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now, I would like you to go through both of the admission procedures and let me know if you have understood them well or not. At the same time, if you have any queries or need any clarity on any particular point, feel free to bring the same forward. So, are the two admission procedures clear?
25/09/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Understood clear
25/09/23, 5:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, now before we move forward with our discussion, it is important for us to be on the same page, considering the same, could you please share your understanding of when your admission process will begin, the two ways in which you can proceed with it, what will be the registration fee and the deadline dates in each approach?
25/09/23, 7:06 pm - +263 77 224 1615: If i choose to be in early decision benefits suppose registration is $ 750 the $150 is paid by Edoofa board the balance of $600 is paid in 2 parts the first is paid within 15days after we receive offer letter and the balance in 30days a
25/09/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 224 1615: On the standard procedures once you receive the offer letter $150 pad by Edoofa board.then the balance of $600 should be completed within 15 days
26/09/23, 2:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good afternoon,

I hope you are well and blessed. Kindly excuse me for being unable to connect with you further, as our available hours had already ended by the time you reached out.

Please let me know if you are available so that we can proceed further with our session?
26/09/23, 2:41 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes available
26/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, please, that is correct. Let me also help you summarize the admission process and the difference between the registration process-

1. The Registration fee will be between $500 to $750 depending on the university and for understanding purposes, let us assume it is $750.

2. With Standard Registration, you will have to make the payment of the complete $750 in one part within 15 days of getting the offer letter.

3. With Early Registration, you will have the grant of $150 after which you have to pay only $600, and that too in two parts of $300. The first part is paid within 15 days and the remaining part is paid within the next 30 days. 

4. With the standard admission process, as a student you are not paying any more amount of fees for your university admission, but rather you are not getting the grant which is a benefit of early registration. 

5. I would also like you to keep a note that the admissions team won't be sharing your application with the universities unless and until the parents share that they are prepared for your admission process and would like us to proceed with the same. 

6. If you want to go with the early registration process, you will have to make the decision to proceed with the admission process.
26/09/23, 2:54 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Please let me know if you are clear on this?
26/09/23, 3:01 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, Now, considering the importance of the deadlines given by the university, first of all, you have to make a decision if you want to avail the Early Decision Benefits for your child’s admission process or not.

If you avail them, in that case, you can get a grant of $150 on the registration fee due and would have the opportunity to pay the fee in two parts at a gap of one month along with the remaining 4 benefits.

If you decide to not avail the benefits at this moment, in that case, you can proceed with the standard admission process when you feel you are prepared to start with your child’s university admission process.
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: While making the decision, you will also have to note that as the name suggests, the early decision benefits are only valid for a limited period of time, and as per the updates shared by the academic board, the students who are able to process their application for university admission before Monday, they would be able to get the same benefits.

If you as parents give us a go-ahead before then and decide to proceed with your child’s admission process early, we would then share the application with the universities this week so that you can get the offer letter early as soon as possible.

When you get the offer letter, after the grant of $150, the fee due of $750 will be reduced to $600 and you will have to pay it in two parts of $300 as per the tentative deadlines of *9th October* and *9th November*.
26/09/23, 3:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, If you as parents are comfortable with the above-mentioned tentative deadlines ( *9th October* and *9th November*.), you can give us the go-ahead so that we can prepare Juliet's application for the scholarship and share it with the universities that are applicable for the course and will be recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board?
26/09/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Go ahead
26/09/23, 5:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: There was an error in the above message. The tentative deadlines will be 14th of October 2023 and 14th November.
26/09/23, 5:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The same goes for this message as well. May I know if we are on the same page?
26/09/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok thanks go ahead
26/09/23, 6:19 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
26/09/23, 6:20 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, as you have given us the go-ahead, let us proceed towards preparing Juliet's application and forward it to the universities, applicable for the course and suggested by the academic board. Once we get an update from the universities, we will reconnect with you and share the same updates with you. In the meantime, if and when you have any queries, feel free to bring them forward so that we can address them and help you plan for Juliet's  higher education well.
26/09/23, 6:22 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Okay noted
26/09/23, 6:28 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to evaluate their application after which if they accept their application for a scholarship, they would send a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
26/09/23, 6:29 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok noted
14/10/23, 8:56 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Juliet.
I hope you're all well and in high spirits!

I have some incredible news to share with you all! Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been diligently processing your scholarship applications for universities in India under the Endowment plan.

With all the efforts we've invested, I'm thrilled to inform you that your application has been accepted by MVN University in India, and they've decided to offer you a scholarship. Congratulations! Your journey to a brighter future starts now!
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Milan Edoofa: The university will soon send you the official offer letter. However, we've received it in advance and couldn't wait to share this exhilarating news. Please take your time to review the letter thoroughly.

In the meantime, I encourage you to note any questions or concerns. Being prepared with your queries will make our discussion more productive. Moving ahead, I am scheduling our next conversation for today at 12.30 PM CAT in which we will discuss the offer letter in detail and move ahead with the next steps in your admission journey. Congratulations to you and your family on this fantastic achievement! 🌟
14/10/23, 8:57 am - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/10/23, 12:38 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Juliet!

May I know if you were able to go through your offer letter from MVN Univeristy by now and if you are available to discuss the same in detail?
14/10/23, 7:50 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Are we going to receive offer letters from some university
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: I'm sorry for going offline during our conversation earlier. I wasn't feeling well with a fever and had to take medicine. I'm back now and ready to continue with our conversation.
15/10/23, 9:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, regarding that, stay assured we will discuss that moving ahead during our conversation please. On that note, may I know if you were able to go through the offer letter by now please?
15/10/23, 9:22 pm - +263 77 887 4090: Yes
15/10/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 887 4090: But wanted to ask if we are going to receive other offer letters from other universities
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I will help you in understanding the same towards the end of our discussion please. For now, I am glad to hear that you were able to go through the offer letter. I would be discussing the letter with you in detail and help you with any of the queries you have, and to commence our letter discussion,  I would like to confirm the details mentioned in your offer letter from MVN University.
15/10/23, 9:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Hence, could you please take a moment to review your letter again and provide me with the following information:

1. What is your per annum tuition fee after the scholarship?
2. What is your per annum accommodation fee after the sponsorship?
3. What is your annual fee at MVN University after the scholarship?
4. What are your Sports and Misc. Fee (One-Time payable)
5. What is the Admission and Processing Fee to be paid to secure your scholarship seat?
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Juliet!
I hope you are doing well today.
16/10/23, 11:29 am - Milan Edoofa: I was expecting a response from your side on this message of mine, hence, can you please respond to the same so that we can move ahead with our discussion regarding the offer letter.
16/10/23, 2:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: Yes, please we will discuss that further during our discussion. For now, can you please answer all the questions here.
16/10/23, 3:17 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Check on my reply  here👆
16/10/23, 4:09 pm - Milan Edoofa: Juliet, please answer point 4 and 5 as well dear.
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Admission and processing $750
16/10/23, 6:08 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Annual fee $2250
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and JUliet!
I hope you are doing well today.
17/10/23, 1:14 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details. As per your offer letter, MVN University has awarded you a 75% scholarship on tuition fees, which means you will only have to pay 25% of the per annum tuition fee for your course at MVN University, i.e. $1000.

Also, coming to the accommodation fees, as you can see in your letter, you have also been awarded a 100% waiver on your accommodation expenses, this means that the accommodation provided to you will be free of cost throughout your stay at MVN University. This is a fantastic opportunity as it further contributes to making your education more affordable, isn’t it?
17/10/23, 3:41 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Noted
17/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as you can see in your offer letter from MVN University, after the scholarship on the tuition and sponsorship fee on accommodation fee, the remaining per annum cost of education that you would have to pay is:

1. Tuition Fee: $1000
2. Accommodation Fee: $0
3. University Infrastructure Fee: $575
4. International Student Development Fund: $300
5. Examination Fee (Per Year): $125
6. EDP & Book Bank Fee: $250
17/10/23, 4:41 pm - Milan Edoofa: With this, if you sum up all the components, you would be able to see that your per annum cost of education is $2250.

Now, for the first year, you can see that there are two components that are one-time payable i.e. Sports Fee and Misc. Fee, so your total expenses for the first year become $2250 + $250 = $2500.

Please note that this cost is only for the first year, and from the second year onwards, your per annum cost of education will be $2250. I hope you are clear about that?
17/10/23, 5:26 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Clear noted
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Juliet!
I hope you are doing well today.
18/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, Now that you are aware of your per annum fee, let me tell you what all facilities are offered by the universities and are covered as per the university's fee structure - 

1. Tuition Fee
2. Living Cost
3. Library Fee
4. Exmanitaion Fee
5. EDB and Book Bank
6. International Student Development Fund
7. 24-Hour Wifi Cost
8. Maintenance Fee, Water Bill, and Electricity Bill.

I hope you are clear with this?
18/10/23, 1:38 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
18/10/23, 4:02 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear thank you
18/10/23, 4:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, to understand how the EWYL Program helps you - Let us assume you earn scholarship credits worth $1000 in a year with the help of the EWYL Program.

Now with this, you can use the earned $1000 to pay a part of your per annum education costs of $2250 and so the balance fee becomes $2250 - $1000 = $1250 which will have to be paid by your parents/guardians at a stretch of one year.

With this, I believe you are able to see how you can make your education more affordable and reduce your family's financial pressure?
18/10/23, 4:37 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes noted
18/10/23, 4:39 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I have asked am I going to receive offer letters from some university from my goggle I have some interest from
18/10/23, 10:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

I am sure you are aware that the Edoofa Scholarship Program is a merit-based scholarship, and hence a student's application is shared with multiple universities that are recommended by the Edoofa Academic Board after considering a student's eligibility, along with the university's ranking and affordability.

After we share the application with the universities, it is on the admissions team of the university to accept or reject an application, and the decision to offer a scholarship depends on them. I hope you are clear till here, right?
19/10/23, 8:22 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok
19/10/23, 8:23 pm - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Clear
19/10/23, 8:28 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say University A and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
19/10/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Not aware
19/10/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.
19/10/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand it with an example as well - 

Let us say you have paid $850 to MVN to reserve your seat with the university and after that, you get a better offer from University A where your registration fee is again $850.

If you wish to change your university to University A, in that case, one is to pay $850, but because you would have already paid $850 for MVN, the same amount would be adjusted against your fee of $850 at University A and so you will not have to pay any other additional of money to reserve your scholarship seat with University or to change your university. 

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
19/10/23, 8:39 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
19/10/23, 9:59 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, I believe you are clear about how the admission process will be completed, right?
20/10/23, 6:18 am - +263 77 887 4090: In which city is MVN university?
20/10/23, 6:37 am - +263 77 224 1615: On previous discussion we have talked about the amount paid by Edoofa.With the MvN offer letter how much is going to be paid by Edoofa
20/10/23, 6:39 am - +263 77 224 1615: On our discussion it seems like you have said registration to secure seat will range to $750 and that we said $150 is the Edoofa
20/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Juliet!
I hope you are doing well today.
20/10/23, 11:58 am - Milan Edoofa: Sure, let me help you with your queries here. MVN University is located in the city of Aurangabad, which is in the National Capital Region of India in the state of Haryana.
20/10/23, 12:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, when it comes to the registration fee at MVN University, I would like to mention that at the time your application was processed, your counselor had shared a special recommendation for a higher quantum of scholarship. Now, when it comes to the $500-750 registration, it is true that it lies within that range, however, since the opportunity that you have received is an exclusive opportunity and the university is offering 75% scholarship on the tuition as well as 100% sponsorship on accommodation fee, therefore, the registration fee, in this case, is towards a higher end. I hope this is clear now?
20/10/23, 3:23 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Clear
20/10/23, 3:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, may I know if you are clear till here as well so that we can proceed?
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Proceed
20/10/23, 3:27 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving ahead, as informed, the admission and processing fee of $1000 mentioned in your offer letter will be adjusted against your first year’s expenses of $2500, therefore the amount of fee that you will be required to pay after you come to India will be $2500  - $1000 = $1500.

I hope you are clear about this as well?
20/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Now, as per the offer letter, you are supposed to pay the registration fee of $1000 to reserve your scholarship seat with the university within 15 days.
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: But, with regards to our previous conversations, I am sure you recall that you have the privilege to get the $150 grant as well as to make the payment of the same in two parts as below -

1. *$425 before 28th October 2023.*
2. *$425 before 28th November 2023.*
20/10/23, 3:32 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alternatively, if you are financially prepared, you can pay the complete fee of $850 within 15 working days by *28th October 2023*. I hope you are clear with this and we are on the same page.
20/10/23, 3:51 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Same page but it seems this ini fees are high thats why i need to compare to make  decisions right now was ranging mu figures at around 600 now stuck
20/10/23, 3:52 pm - Milan Edoofa: I did not get you here well dear, can you please come again?
20/10/23, 6:01 pm - +263 77 887 4090: It seems as if at MVN university the fees are high so we need yo compare with other universities
20/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 77 224 1615: On our last discussion we told to prepare for 500-750 which will be paid in 2 phases   .thats why i think maybe if other  university   will reply maybe there are a bit lower in price.
20/10/23, 8:46 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, I believe you are having some kind of misunderstanding about the offer letter as well as the costs at MVN Univeristy. Since MVN is one of those universities that offers the highest quantum of scholarship as well as makes it very affordable for you to continue with the higher education. However, I would still like to ask you which costs seem straining to you?
20/10/23, 9:09 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Or else  may i be allowed  this figure in 3 phases
20/10/23, 9:11 pm - Milan Edoofa: If I may ask, are you mentioning about the admission fee please?
21/10/23, 8:31 am - +263 77 224 1615: Admission fee
21/10/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Good Morning Parents and Juliet!
I hope you are doing well today.
21/10/23, 10:28 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please, thank you for letting me know of that please. Now, shall we move ahead with our discussion here regarding the same?
22/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
22/10/23, 9:28 am - +263 77 224 1615: Let me create a laugh to you .    when  i goggle about the India universties i find these universities and develop interests even though i never been at that place .
1.Lovely Professional University
2.Chandigarh
3.CT university
4Ana Galgotias
24/10/23, 3:40 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I was refering to this statement
24/10/23, 9:30 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Juliet!
I hope you are doing well today.

As you may know, today was Dussehra, a significant festival here in India, and our team was not available due to the holiday. On this auspicious occasion of Dussehra, I also extend my warmest wishes to you and your family. May the festival bring joy, prosperity, and success into your life. ✨

On that note, I would like to schedule a conversation with you at 09:30 AM CAT tomorrow to continue with our discussion here about your admission process. I look forward to our discussion tomorrow, until then have a blessed evening!
25/10/23, 10:38 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes, but not sure
25/10/23, 10:39 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me address this query of yours by helping you understand how a student's university admission process is carried out.

25/10/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 224 1615: Clear
25/10/23, 10:42 am - Milan Edoofa: As of now, your application has been only accepted by MVN University and since we have shared your application with multiple universities, we are also hoping to receive updates from multiple universities. Once we get the same, we will surely inform you, but each university takes its own time to consider the application and so you have to be patient while the universities are evaluating the application. 

I hope you are clear about this now?
25/10/23, 10:49 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
25/10/23, 10:54 am - Milan Edoofa: Now, As you know that each university takes its own time to evaluate an application, In that case, if you wish to wait for an update from let us say LPU and end up missing the opportunity given by MVN, you would lose out on the scholarship from MVN and won't be able to join it in the future. 

To help you with that, there is a transfer option available to the students. Are you aware of that?
25/10/23, 11:05 am - +263 77 224 1615: No thanks to let me know
25/10/23, 11:09 am - Milan Edoofa: Let me help you understand about the Transfer Option better -

Without any worries/concerns, you can go ahead and reserve your scholarship seat with MVN by paying your registration fee due. 

If and when in the future, you get a better scholarship offer and wish to change your university, in that case, you would have the opportunity to change your university without paying any additional amount of money.

If you do not get a better scholarship offer, in that case, you will be able to pursue your education at MVN without risking losing out on the scholarship.

I hope you are clear with this and have a better understanding?
25/10/23, 11:12 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
25/10/23, 11:13 am - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that please. Now, I believe you have proper clarity on the concern that you had, right?
25/10/23, 11:14 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
25/10/23, 11:14 am - Milan Edoofa: Great! Moving ahead, can you please also let me know if you are clear till here as well?
25/10/23, 11:17 am - +263 77 224 1615: Yes clear
25/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. Now, let us come to the payment mode for your university registration fee due -

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
25/10/23, 11:17 am - Milan Edoofa: There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
25/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 77 224 1615: I stay in Masvingo
25/10/23, 12:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for sharing this with me. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
25/10/23, 12:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
25/10/23, 12:16 pm - Milan Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
25/10/23, 12:43 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Am not in Harare  .its expensive to go to Harare From Masvingo meaning outside Masvingo town
25/10/23, 12:48 pm - Milan Edoofa: I understand that it can be expensive to travel from Masvingo to Harare, in that case, I was also going through your application file and noticed that you made a deposit of your enrollment fee through Mr. Charles's FBC Bank Account.

If you want to use the same mode of payment for your university registration fee, you can do that as well since it would be feasible and the International Transfer Charges are 12.5% of the amount you want to send. Shall I share the account details with you once again for your reference?
25/10/23, 12:53 pm - +263 77 224 1615: What about if i use visa card
25/10/23, 12:56 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright, please. On that note, if you wish to use the VISA Card, then you can make the payment directly through our website, shall I guide you with that?
25/10/23, 12:58 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Yes
25/10/23, 1:01 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>

28/10/23, 11:39 am - Vilsha Edoofa: Good Morning, Parents and Juliet,

I am Ms. Vilsha, the Head of Admissions at Edoofa. I was reviewing the recent discussions you had with Mr. Milan and noticed that you have encountered some challenges with the payment process. Hence, I wanted to reach out to you today to gain a better understanding of these challenges, so I can provide you with the necessary assistance and solutions. 

Our goal is to ensure that you can secure your scholarship seat at MVN University promptly. Your feedback will help us find the best way forward. How can we assist you in overcoming these challenges?
28/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 224 1615: You can address the invoice to this email  or else  send the link for the master card
28/10/23, 12:05 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Really i want to secure my seat
28/10/23, 12:08 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I understand @263772241615, let me request the accounts team for another invoice for Paypal. I hope you are aware that for Paypal, the transfer charges are 10% of the amount you want to send, and hence the invoice amount will be $467. If you are comfortable with the same, shall I assist you with the invoice?
28/10/23, 12:09 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Additionally, if you have a debit card, you can make the payment through Edoofa's website: [https://www.edoofa.com/]. The transfer charges for this option are the same as PayPal. You will find the payment button in the middle of the page, as shown in the screenshot below. <This message was edited>
28/10/23, 12:10 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
28/10/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 224 1615: We explained my situation yesterday  .
28/10/23, 12:26 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I did not get you well @263772241615. If you don't mind me asking, can you please come again and help me understand your messages better?
28/10/23, 12:28 pm - +263 77 224 1615: My invoice is here i want to pay with visa card can you provide a link  or address the invoice to that email for it to be able to pay
28/10/23, 12:29 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Surely @263772241615. In regards to the same, I was hoping to get a confirmation on the amount so that I can request the accounts team.
28/10/23, 12:29 pm - +263 77 224 1615: You have send me the invoice
28/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 224 1615: 425
28/10/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 224 1615: 425
28/10/23, 12:32 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Yes, please, the invoice amount would be $467 with the transfer charges. Once you deposit $467, after deducting the transfer charges of 10%, the amount we will receive in India against Juliet's fee will be $425.
28/10/23, 12:34 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: If we help you with an invoice of $425, the amount we will receive in India will be $386 since 10% of the amount would be charged by Paypal for processing rhe transaction from Africa to India. 5% will be deducted at the source (Africa) and the reamining 5% will be deducted at the destination (India).
28/10/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I explined that i leave in rural area  i made  the deposit   of 445  in some one s visa card failng to raised the 7/%extra    charge needed to pay the Harare gay .and 12 /% for mr Jerera    .the bank explained to me  it need 3 % transaction charges .now as we are talking i dont have any means
28/10/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I have the offer letter of   MVN and banking details    .i was given an invoice  i think he did not sign up  .
28/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Iam instructing someone to do the payment as im not well vesed with technology  .
28/10/23, 1:01 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: I can understand your situation @⁨~laizavarandeni⁩, the 3% transfer charges you are referring to must be the one that is deducted by the bank for the visa card and not for Paypal. If you wish to clarify the same from your bank, you can certainly do the same.

With that said, since you mentioned that you have already made the payment to someone, what we can do is, we can help you with a paypal imvoce of $425 and if there's any difference in the amount that can be later on. I hope that works?
28/10/23, 1:08 pm - +263 77 224 1615: What  about this one.
28/10/23, 1:13 pm - +263 77 224 1615: I just want to ask i am not allowed  to pay direct   to MVN .  May extend me   by a week . It seems you are now starting the story .but i told you what i  have    .i have the invoice .ijust request you to  direct the invoice or provide link .
28/10/23, 1:14 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Then you started the disscussion .
28/10/23, 1:15 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: https://www.paypal.com/invoice/p/#URF4XAXLGJJP74KQ

As we discussed over the call sir, here is the PayPal invoice for Juliet's university registration fee due. The invoice is directed to thaliamun@gmail.com
28/10/23, 1:17 pm - +263 77 224 1615: Ok.  But what is the procedure  of payment    we need to discuss also
28/10/23, 1:17 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Also, regarding this sir, I believe we discussed this over the call where I mentioned that due to the network challenges, it is quite possible that you might not be able to see the payment button and hence in that case, PayPal seems to be a better option? Please correct me if I did not understand you well.
28/10/23, 1:19 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: The payment procedure is clear and has been highlighted in Juliet's offer letter from MVN University. I believe Mr. Milan must have shared the same with you early on during your discussion with him. 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account through a telegraphic transfer. 

However, since you mentioned that you wish to make the payment through the visa card, alternative payment options such as Paypal and payment through the website have been presented to you and now it is upto you to decide which payment mode you feel most comfortable with me and then process the payment.
28/10/23, 1:22 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: Please understand that you are talking about securing a scholarshi[ seat with a university abroad and hence students from all over the world are competing against this scholarsho seat. The university has to be fair to each and every student and to ensure that all the students get the same opportunity, the university has given you a due date and that has to be respected.
28/10/23, 1:23 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: With that said, I just received an update that the payment of $425 has been processed through the above-shared link. We will share the same update with the accounts team and let the university officials know accordingly. Once the amount is received in India, we will reconnect with you and let you know the balance amount after deducting the transfer charges that is to be paid in the month of November to complete Juliet's remaining admission formalities.
28/10/23, 1:24 pm - Vilsha Edoofa: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Juliet,

I trust that you and your family are doing well today. It is me Mr. Shivjeet your admission officer and it is nice to reconnect with you again.
