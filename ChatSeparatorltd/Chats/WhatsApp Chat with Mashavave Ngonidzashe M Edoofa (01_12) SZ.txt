Then i moved to our Provincial town Masvingo  to seek better education  ,and i learned   at Ndarama High school  and chose to do Mathematics, geography  and  Computer  science   
I wish to do biochemical  engineering  or software  engineering  or any program under mining sector 
On a sad note, my parents didn't have qualifications ,all of them does not have even an O level  because of their backgrounds  so they  are not employed  ,my mother  is at home and my dad is in South Africa struggling  for the family to survive 
Actually  my family  is not financially stable  that's why my dad is struggling for me to have better education  so that i can change  our living  style 

I like playing indoor games such as chess  and I'm  also interested in outdoor games especially  netball and athletics  and i like ministering the word of God 
I don't like  embarrassing others
05/12/23, 12:50 pm - +263 77 992 5799: I'm  a very hardworking  girl and I'm  full of respect

Your achievements are indeed extremely remarkable. Your diverse interests and positive qualities make you stand out in a crowd. Your passion for indoor games like chess and your involvement in outdoor activities such as netball and athletics showcase a well-rounded and active lifestyle. The fact that you enjoy ministering the word of God reflects a strong spiritual connection and a commitment to sharing positive values. Your aversion to embarrassing others demonstrates a considerate and empathetic nature, qualities that contribute to creating a supportive and harmonious environment! I have confidence that you are an exceptionally diligent student, and you will undoubtedly demonstrate your capabilities if given the right guidance!

09/12/23, 1:22 pm - +263 77 992 5799: <Media omitted>
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I truly admire your vision, Ngonidzashe! Exposure to foreign tertiary education offers numerous advantages. It broadens students' horizons by introducing them to diverse cultures and perspectives, improving language skills, and providing a global outlook. They gain access to world-class academic institutions, form international networks, and develop invaluable personal and professional skills. This experience fosters personal growth, enhances career prospects, and cultivates global citizenship. In essence, studying abroad is a transformative journey that equips students with the knowledge, skills, and perspective needed to thrive in our interconnected world!
09/12/23, 1:24 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident about achieving it!
09/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 992 5799: Exactly  ,that's why i really  like to study in India ,besides that India is my favourite country
09/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 992 5799: Okay 
I hope and i have  faith that  I'm  going  to obtain   best results
09/12/23, 2:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I believe you will ace your exams with flying colours, Ngonidzashe! Could you kindly brief me regarding your career aspirations more vividly? <This message was edited>

11/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 992 5799: Good morning
11/12/23, 8:35 am - +263 77 992 5799: If i do biochemical engineering ,I'm excited by the idea of working in the pharmaceutical industry because of the impact that new drugs and treatments can have on people's lives. I'm also interested in the business side of the industry, and how new treatments are brought to market. I'm especially interested in working for a company that's committed to advancing science and improving the lives of patients.

But if i fail to do biochemical engineering  ,i can do software engineering since I'm also  interested in computer science and the impact it has on the world. I'm fascinated by the power of code to solve complex problems and make people's lives easier. I'm excited about the prospect of working with cutting-edge technology to create innovative software solutions. I'm especially interested in working for a company that values creativity and problem-solving.

14/12/23, 2:23 pm - +263 77 992 5799: It's fascinating to see the global impact of Indian programmers and tech entrepreneurs.

14/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 77 992 5799: What are other countries it  recommends  besides India?
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ngonidzashe. *Edoofa* exclusively endorses India, please!
14/12/23, 2:27 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: After reading all of these fascinating facts, I'm sure you're interested in studying in India. 
So, explain to me how studying in India can help you advance in your job and how you aim to achieve your career goals as a result of your studies in India?

Now moving forward, as far as I can tell, you recognize *Edoofa's* commitment to providing high-quality university education to its students, so that upon completion of their studies, they would be able to achieve their career goals and have a bright future.
 
Are you familiar with the cost of similar quality of higher education for an international student who does not have access to a scholarship?
14/12/23, 2:48 pm - +263 77 992 5799: I have learned that the cost of similar quality higher education without a scholarship can be quite high. In addition, there are also costs associated with living expenses, such as housing, food, and transportation. All of this can add up to a significant financial burden for international students. That's why I'm grateful that *Edoofa* is working to make education more accessible and affordable for everyone.
14/12/23, 3:01 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Not to worry, Ngonidzashe! Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth properly.
 
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around $6000-$8000 per year. Now this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc. It is still beyond the reach of many.
So with the Edoofa Scholarship Program the cost trips down to $2000-$3000 for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying in the Eligibility check Process.
This cost includes:
1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)
2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Gym, Laundry, etc.)
3. Food
4. Accommodation
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, If you meet and exceed our academic criteria with a high passing grade, you become eligible for the exclusive 90-100% scholarship. With the 90-100% Scholarship, you will only need to pay a minimal fee ranging from $1200-$1800, which covers your entire expenses, including food, accommodation, tuition, etc!
14/12/23, 3:02 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So looking at the reduced fees do you feel it is affordable for your family?
14/12/23, 3:07 pm - +263 77 992 5799: While the reduced fees offered by *Edoofa* are certainly more affordable than other universities, I must admit that it would still be a significant financial burden for my family. However, I believe that the long-term benefits of a high-quality education will outweigh the short-term financial challenges. I am confident that the investment in my education will pay off in the future, both for myself and for my family. I am also exploring other options for funding my education, such as student loans .
14/12/23, 3:12 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ngonidzashe. Our support doesn't stop there! Edoofa also offers an innovative *Earn While You Learn Program*. This program allows you to further reduce your remaining fees by gaining practical work experience while studying. It not only eases the financial burden but also provides you with valuable skills and industry exposure, enhancing your employability and ensuring a well-rounded education.

With *Edoofa's* 90-100% Scholarship and the opportunity to earn while you learn, you can focus on your studies, explore your field of interest, and prepare for a successful career.

So do you want me to guide you about the *Earn while you learn* program in depth?
14/12/23, 3:19 pm - +263 77 992 5799: Wow that's  so good 
Yes sir you can elaborate further
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Well, Ngonidzashe. Let me introduce to you *The Earn While You Learn Program* or the *EWYL Program* which is the backbone of *Edoofa* and the unique aspect of the whole program. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.

The EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0
Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 2.Recruitment Partners: -
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3.Webinars: -
We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.
Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world by Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade.
How to network like a boss by Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi
How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer! by Ms. Yasmin Bitugu
It’s never too late to pursue your passion: My journey from real estate to entrepreneurship by Mr. Ronard Kachaje
Decoding the science of personal branding by Mr, Simon Maingi
14/12/23, 3:22 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases. 

What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be beneficial for you?
14/12/23, 3:44 pm - +263 77 992 5799: I can certainly see the benefits of EWYL As you mentioned, they provide valuable insights into the job market and the skills needed to succeed. This is especially important for students like me who are about to enter the workforce after graduation. Knowing what employers are looking for and how to stand out from other candidates is crucial. I think that the competitive advantage Edoofians have is really valuable, and I'm excited to be able to take advantage of it.
14/12/23, 3:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Perfect! So now, if I have to help you explain, how the *Earn While You Learn Program* helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1600 a year. Now if you manage to self-finance scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can self-finance $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $400 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $40-$60 a month
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly._

Now you see, the amazing aspect about this is that the annual fee of the student which includes the remaining cost of tuition fees, food and accommodation expenses will have to be paid semester wise which would be in installments of 6 months each that too after the student arrives at the University.
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So for example, if after the scholarship the annual fee of the student comes to be let us say $1600, now to the University it has to be paid Semester Wise ( 2 Installments of 6 months each). Therefore it is paid like $800 in the first semester and $800 in the next semester, but there would be the Earn While You Learn Program which would help the student in reducing the semester fee as well.

Usually what parents do is, since after arriving in India students do get an Indian Bank Account opened, parents can also deposit the fee on a monthly basis into the students account and the student in one go can complete the semester fee after the interval of 6 months itself!
14/12/23, 3:50 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

In my experience of educating and counseling over 1000+ students, I couldn't help but notice a very unique observation. The ones who have sincerely followed through with their Earn While You Learn Program by participating in and performing projects and assignments have always found success in building their skill set and earning credits.

A student who is consistent in attending their Earn While You Learn Program sessions, is always reaching out to their respective mentor in order to learn more about their performance and seek guidance on how to approve their performance across all the projects is always able to earn a higher amount of scholarship credits.

*"Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire." - W.B. Yeats*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
18/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 992 5799: I'm fine  sir
I'm so sorry for  replying late
18/12/23, 9:58 am - +263 77 992 5799: I'm ready
18/12/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ngonidzashe!
18/12/23, 10:07 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
18/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 77 992 5799: Yes, I'm starting to see how the EWYL program can benefit me in multiple ways. Not only will I gain real-world experience and insights into my chosen field, but I'll also have the opportunity to earn scholarship credits that will help offset the cost of my education. This is a win-win situation for me and my parents. I can focus on my studies without having to worry about the financial burden, and they can rest assured that I'm making the most of my education. I'm very grateful for this opportunity.
18/12/23, 10:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Amazing! I’ll have to add that I’m flabbergasted by the fact that you are comprehending every piece of information so brilliantly!

Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to be different from other scholarship programs, few facts which you must have noticed during our counseling :
1. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships* ​: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses,which is completely waived off.
 
2. *Employability through practical training* ​: We believe Students shouldn't just learn in theory, they should gain real-world experience instead of academic theory. That is why we help them by designing a practical employment oriented curriculum that helps students pick up job skills needed to be employable.
18/12/23, 10:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: 3. *Earn While You Learn* : The most valuable learning comes from doing and involving. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What’s more, students earn scholarship credits in the process, thereby further reducing the burden of the cost of their education.
 
4. *Higher Education Concierge* : A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education.
18/12/23, 10:26 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So, after looking over the facts that distinguish Edoofa, which of the four points did you appreciate the most?
18/12/23, 9:49 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 7:53 am - +263 77 992 5799: All four points are very impressive, but if I had to choose just one, it would be the "higher education concierge" point. I think having a dedicated team of professionals who can help guide me through the process of higher education is valuable. They can provide personalized guidance, help me with the application process, and offer support throughout my journey. I believe this level of support is unique and not offered by many other universities. I think it's the most distinguishing feature of Edoofa.
19/12/23, 9:06 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Good Morning,

*“The great aim of education is not knowledge, but action.” - Herbert Spencer*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
19/12/23, 10:10 am - +263 77 992 5799: Yes I'm ready
19/12/23, 10:23 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ngonidzashe!
19/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am elated to hear that, Ngonidzashe! One of the most reassuring things about being an *Edoofian* is that we, here at *Edoofa*, always have your back!
19/12/23, 10:24 am - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
19/12/23, 4:30 pm - +263 77 992 5799: My family is very supportive of my decision to study abroad. They understand that it's a great opportunity for me to experience a new culture, gain new perspectives, and develop important skills. They're also excited about the possibility of me coming home with a better understanding of the world and a stronger sense of independence. They know that it's a big step for me, but they believe that it will be worth it in the end. They're very proud of me for making this decision and taking on this challenge.
19/12/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I am glad to hear that. Studying internationally can accelerate your career progression, potentially leading to higher-paying job opportunities, enabling you to independently support your family, and ensuring a peaceful and stress-free life for your parents.
19/12/23, 4:30 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form* 

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university, isn't it?
19/12/23, 4:34 pm - +263 77 992 5799: Yes, those are all important aspects of the application process. You're right, the application form is the first step, and it provides basic information about you and your background. The statement of purpose is a critical part of the application, as it gives you the chance to tell your story and explain why you want to pursue a graduate degree. The letter of recommendation is also an important part of the process, as it allows your recommenders to speak to your strengths and qualities. In addition to these things, you'll also likely need to submit test scores, transcripts, and other supporting materials. The specific requirements vary depending on the university.
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Correct! Moving on, *When a student applies alone for an international University* , on an average the application fee of a University is $150-$200. Statement of Purpose of the students costs higher between $120-$150 respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, for a student to apply to just 5 Universities the average cost incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750 (Application Form + Statement of Purpose). *without even receiving a guarantee to be selected or not*
And do you know this is one reason which Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurity of what would happen, and just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create the statement of purpose but also helps you with the *Visa Documentation Assistance,University Selection and sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than $1350-$1750 without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only $750. This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 4:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: This enrollment fee includes your

- *Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
- *Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
- *Earn While You Learn Program and training*
- *University sessions and interactions*
- *A guaranteed scholarship seat*
- *Visa Documentation Assistance*
- *The Foster and Care throughout your course*

On a positive note, I am here to begin our session
Are you ready?
20/12/23, 12:34 pm - +263 77 992 5799: Yes I'm ready
20/12/23, 12:39 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: I hope you are having a wonderful day, Ngonidzashe!
20/12/23, 12:40 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: May I know whether you have comprehended the information propagated during the previous session, please?
20/12/23, 1:41 pm - +263 77 992 5799: I have definitely understood the information that was shared during the previous session. I am now aware of the benefits of enrolling in Edoofa's program, including the savings on services, such as visa documentation, university selection, and SLC classes. I understand that Edoofa is committed to helping students through every step of the process, and I'm confident that enrolling in the program will be a positive experience. I really appreciate you taking the time to share this information with me.
20/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.
*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).
*Phase 3:* Once the final A results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents.
*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*
20/12/23, 2:19 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
20/12/23, 4:06 pm - Shashwat Edoofa 2: Are we still connected? If you are facing any challenges, please do let me know.
