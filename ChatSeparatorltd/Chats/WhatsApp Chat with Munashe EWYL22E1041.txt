29/08/23, 4:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Now, I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – the festival of Rakhi. The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:50 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As a result, there will be no sessions tomorrow, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

I trust you're doing well

Our conversation on call was truly enjoyable, and I'd like to kindly remind you of the three tasks you need to complete:

📍 Please ask your *parents to confirm in this group that you've discussed the $300 plan with them*.
📍 *Share a screenshot* of the *Google review* you write for Edoofa.
📍 *share a screenshot* of the *Facebook review* you write for Edoofa.
03/10/23, 8:09 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *_Good evening, Munashe_*
It was lovely talking to you. I am sure that you have understood each and everything clearly. 

As discussed, kindly complete the following tasks as soon as possible. These are some interesting yet very less time taking tasks - 

📍 *A photo of you in your college campus* :

📍 *Date of birth* -
03/10/23, 8:46 pm - Sharda Edoofa: _*Attention*_

It's quite disheartening to observe that you haven't managed to spare *enough time to share your Facebook and Google reviews* with me. I see only two conceivable explanations for this:

1. You don't deem this as important or *valuable.*
2. You're *postponing it*, intending to do it at your leisure.

If there is any other reason, I am happy to understand that. If neither of these reasons applies, I expect you to submit them by *12 PM tomorrow!*

As your senior/brother I am here to share with you how I made it happen for myself, why I call myself a PROUD Edoofian, and why I want my brothers and sisters to join the community and start their higher education journey. Now I know you have a lot of questions. I had mine when I was at your place. So Let us start with:


1) How to apply and fast-track your application process in the Edoofa Scholarship
Program?
2) Why did I choose the Edoofa Program over other agents and consultants?
3) Before you ask me what the Earn While You Learn Program (EWYL) is, let me explain
to you the uniqueness of the Edoofa Program.

15/11/23, 3:17 pm - +91 92892 28166: Oky maam   Outreaching potential students from across the Globe now there is need to be a   Way where we can actually get a chance to let evry single students in Africa get to know about The Edoofa scholarship program  and i have seen  outreaching to schools is one way we can connect with student which we  the edoofians has already done that.But however there is still a challenge in that we have not reachouted to all four parts of Africa . As edoofians  we can choose from our students those from. Here and some who are still in Zimbabwe.   And send them to all parts of the african communities to do campaigns educating and informing aother students and school who are not aware of this delightful and amazing journey of education .this can help us in that there some students out there who are searching for this opportunity  but some do not have access for example cellpphone and internet . Therefore  employing   Some of these Students  for campaigns who will be going  moving around  all corners of education  providing information  will be  another development to reachout to our fellow pontential students out there
15/11/23, 3:19 pm - +91 92892 28166: I have to  answer from questions one to 4
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Your idea of expanding outreach to all parts of Africa through student ambassadors is brilliant and has the potential to make a significant impact. Utilizing students who have experienced the Edoofa scholarship program as ambassadors to reach out to their communities can bring authenticity and relatability to the message.
15/11/23, 3:30 pm - Sharda Edoofa: yes
15/11/23, 3:32 pm - +91 92892 28166: Yes maam  and it can in reducing doubts to  those  who wants to join

Thank you for your appreciation!
28/11/23, 1:53 pm - +91 92892 28166: From my own understanding The "spirit of competition" refers to the attitude or mindset with which people engage in competitive activities or challenging themsleves to reach certain goals  and archievement ,something that have never been done anyone . It embodies principles of fairness, respect, and sportsmanship. It's about striving to win while also acknowledging and respecting the abilities and efforts of others. In essence, it's the positive and respectful approach to competition

 This attitude of having a mindset  infuences me positively and most of the time its the reason why do not give up especially when i fail in archiving  certain goals . When ever i feel like um now giving up    , the spirit of competition always come back into mind and i start asking my self  so how did the other successful  individuals of my generation doing . In my mind i will raise a question of how did they make it up there  and these thoughts tracks me back to  my goals and the things i want to archive in my life . 

And it is this spirit of competition why i am here studying law in indai . It motivated me to take my education  internally ,to hold something bigger than just ordinary like  others . For me my passion is to do some that is recognised from the crowd .  There is a saying “If you have a positive attitude and constantly strive to give your best effort ,eventually you will overcome your immediate problems and your are ready for greater challenges.” And this can only be archived when one has a spirit of competition in thier mindset  giving exapmle of Elon Musk ,  and the founder of Amazon  just to mention a few .

And it is this spirit of competition why we are  here today  enjoying  this beautiful invention of technology and networks  where it is making our lives even more easier and overcome some challenges
28/11/23, 3:59 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Your understanding of the "spirit of competition" is comprehensive and well-articulated. You effectively highlight its positive influence on your mindset, emphasizing principles of fairness, respect, and sportsmanship. Your personal connection to the spirit of competition, using it as a source of motivation and resilience, is a powerful testament to its impact. The way you relate it to your academic pursuits, citing examples like Elon Musk and the founder of Amazon, adds depth to your perspective. Additionally, your acknowledgment of how the spirit of competition has contributed to technological advancements and improvements in our lives is insightful. Overall, your thoughtful reflection captures the multifaceted nature of the spirit of competition and its pervasive influence on personal and societal achievements. Well done!
28/11/23, 4:41 pm - +91 92892 28166: Thank you maan
28/11/23, 4:41 pm - +91 92892 28166: How are you today

09/12/23, 2:26 pm - Sharda Edoofa: As we embark on today's session, let's kick things off with a motivational riddle: "I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"

Before we unravel the answer, let's ponder on a quote from the legendary Steve Jobs: "Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work."
09/12/23, 6:57 pm - Sharda Edoofa: *It is time to wrap up our session.*

I would also like to understand the reason behind your absence.
09/12/23, 7:39 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

I hope this message finds you well. As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold.🤝

20/12/23, 7:53 am - Sharda Edoofa: Good Morning Munashe
I hope you are doing well

You are welcome please.
20/12/23, 9:19 am - +91 92892 28166: I am fine and you ma'am
20/12/23, 9:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: I am good too, thank you so  much for asking.
20/12/23, 9:45 am - Sharda Edoofa: I want to acknowledge and appreciate the effort you've consistently put into your community building project. Your dedication is truly commendable, and I'm impressed with the progress you've made.

To make sure you maximize your opportunities for scholarship credits, I'd like to share some important information. Your hard work deserves recognition, and I'm here to help you navigate the steps to secure the complete scholarship credits.
20/12/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Now that you have submitted the student application forms -

Please make sure the students are completely aware of what Edoofa is and what it does and even what a student goes through in the admission stages.

If the student goes to the admission counselor and denies *you* did not discuss anything about Edoofa then *you will not earn any scholarship credits*.

To be on a safer side. Connect with the students on WhatsApp personally. Once they fill the form. Then *give them resources and information about Edoofa*. 

*Train them about the process* so they are informed completely when the admission counselors will contact them and also, *we will have proof that yes you have explained it all.*
20/12/23, 9:46 am - Sharda Edoofa: Make it clear to students that Edoofa is not a sponsorship platform. Rather, you will get a scholarship on the basis of various factors which include your grades in previous classes, the way you perform in your interviews, your statement of purpose, your letter of recommendation and many more

Also, you can compare the cost of studying in your own country with the cost of studying in India through Edoofa. And guess what? *It's usually cheaper to study in India with Edoofa!*
20/12/23, 10:48 am - +91 92892 28166: Oky ma'am thank you for the information
20/12/23, 10:50 am - Sharda Edoofa: You are welcome please.
20/12/23, 10:51 am - +91 92892 28166: Soo maam  so far how many scholarship credits do I have now
20/12/23, 2:31 pm - Sharda Edoofa: Munashe, I am a bit occupied for now. It will take me some time to figure this out but I will get back to you once I get to know the same
20/12/23, 2:40 pm - +91 92892 28166: oky ma'am
