12/09/23, 12:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello Takondwa, I hope you are doing well. 
I am *Ms. Saloni* and I will be your *EWYL mentor* now.

How are you?
12/09/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This is a reminder that our scheduled session will be happening from *01:30-02:30* PM this week as discussed except on Saturday and Sunday. Also, if you cannot attend your session, please inform me beforehand for better clarity and communication.
12/09/23, 2:11 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
12/09/23, 2:19 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Am also thrilled to having this opportunity
12/09/23, 3:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.

13/09/23, 1:43 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Oky
13/09/23, 1:51 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Takondwa, I kindly ask you to invite your parents to join the group so that they can _actively participate in your progress and share in the achievements you will make._ I am providing you with the link once again so that you can extend the invitation to them. Once your parents have joined the group, we can embark on this thrilling journey together!

14/09/23, 1:36 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Happy Thursday my lovely student!_
How are you doing this morning?

Let's begin with our session👋🏻
14/09/23, 1:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/09/23, 1:39 pm - Saloni Edoofa: So Takondwa, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them?
14/09/23, 1:47 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: My long term go is becoming a Physiotherapist and opening a health center n EWYL will help me get enough money to make my school fees easier to pay
14/09/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: That is great, I am so happy to meet you and I promise that together we can achieve all these things.
14/09/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
14/09/23, 1:49 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Nk
14/09/23, 1:49 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: No
14/09/23, 1:56 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
14/09/23, 1:57 pm - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Ooh oky
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I am really happy with the progress we have made so far and I hope that we take many steps ahead toward a fruitful session tomorrow.
Hoping to see you with the same zeal and enthusiasm *tomorrow* at your given time slot (01:30-02:30 PM) here in your EWYL Group.
14/09/23, 2:38 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Oky thank you
15/09/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
15/09/23, 2:12 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/09/23, 2:33 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Your sessions will be held from next week, Monday onwards from 01:30-02:30 PM.
No sessions will be held on Saturday and Sunday.
Till then, have a great weekend🌺
15/09/23, 2:34 pm - +265 990 55 81 18: Same to u

Takondwa is currently out of reach, she is in school and no phone as of now,
May we request that we continue in Dec after she comes
26/09/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
26/09/23, 1:48 pm - Saloni Edoofa: In case you, as a student, are not available, your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days. 

Session time will be *Monday and Thursday from 12:30  PM to 01:30 PM*⏳

Please acknowledge the same, and I will plan the sessions accordingly.

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 4:02 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Emotions ran high as the students shared their hopes and dreams, igniting a wave of anticipation. From wishes for kindness to dreams of adventure, the excitement was contagious! The air buzzed with the thrill of anticipation as the magic of Secret Santa bound hearts together in the spirit of giving. 🤗💫
So, dear student, *what do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this year*? 🌟🎄
