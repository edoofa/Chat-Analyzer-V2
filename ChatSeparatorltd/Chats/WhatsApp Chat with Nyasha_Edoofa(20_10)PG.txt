So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
31/10/23, 8:32 pm - +263 77 349 4745: I'm  not aware of it but I sense it cost
31/10/23, 8:33 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Please Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*

31/10/23, 10:13 pm - +263 77 349 4745: The fees are reduced for sure, due to financial  constraints  I will  be struggling  to  pay. Our economy  is in bad shape at the moment  that has affected  our wages in such a way that we put food on the table with difficulties
01/11/23, 9:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!

I hope that you all are doing well, Kindly excuse me for the delay as my laptop was updating, 

Are you ready for the session?
01/11/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: I understand that, Mr. Moses!!

let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
01/11/23, 8:47 pm - +263 77 349 4745: I don't  know how it is done, I will be happy  if there is opportunity  like that for my daughter  to pursue  he dream

02/11/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing the session, Please let me tell you how Edoofa helps students bring down the fees themselves and make them affordable. It is through the


*Earn While You Learn Program*


The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable. <This message was edited>
02/11/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Actually, the Earn While You Learn Program helps the students to learn and develop the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely include Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.


*The EWYL Program*, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics. Promising a better future for its students, and converting an Individual into a Market Ready Professional. Who would have every weapon in their arsenal to conquer the place they shall be landing their foot in.
02/11/23, 1:04 pm - +263 77 349 4745: I'm  doing well and how are you doing too
02/11/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *The EWYL Program* has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.
02/11/23, 1:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Projects with Brands and Companies: -*
The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, The following are:
Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.
02/11/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Recruitment Partners: -*
Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics
02/11/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
02/11/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
02/11/23, 1:05 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think Nyasha will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
02/11/23, 1:15 pm - +263 77 349 4745: I think Nyasha  will learn a lot if she is successful  to be part of this program  and she will benefit  through  the knowledge  that has been outlined  above
02/11/23, 1:20 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed


If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
02/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 77 349 4745: I really  love this program ,  I will  be happy  if my daughter  can be part  of it
02/11/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: For any question apart from whatever has been discussed, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has answers to most of the queries
Furthermore if you have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions and get back to me
02/11/23, 2:22 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Also, I am sharing some pictures of the students who are studying in India through the Edoofa Program
