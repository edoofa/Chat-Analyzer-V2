For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them. 

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
01/08/23, 8:49 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes mam
01/08/23, 8:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/08/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 643 0351: We are done you may continue
01/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

Step 1: *Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
01/08/23, 9:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 2: *Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear?
01/08/23, 9:14 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes ma'am
01/08/23, 9:26 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

Step 3: *Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa share their recommendations and insights from their 13+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
01/08/23, 9:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 4: *Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
01/08/23, 9:27 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes
01/08/23, 9:32 pm - +263 77 643 0351: We are following ma'am
01/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps- 

Step 5: *Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $750. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
01/08/23, 9:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Step 6: *VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India for starting your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
01/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes it is clear
01/08/23, 9:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: That is great to hear. Now, if we are on the same page and if you are available, shall we proceed with the first step in your admission process which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
01/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Very clear thank you
01/08/23, 9:39 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes we can proceed
01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, please. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.
01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I shall share the videos with you now.
01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 1:  Important Message for Enrolled Students*

This is a video by the founders of EDOOFA, in which they share 2 important qualities of successful Edoofians- who've secured a maximum scholarship and earned scholarship credits.

01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

The third video is about Schools, Colleges, and Universities. I'm sure you're excited to learn more about the schools, colleges, and universities on the Edoofa Platform.

01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools- SOP*

The fourth video is about the Statement of Purpose (SOP). The most important step towards securing a good scholarship is to write the Statement of Purpose but to know why it is important, watching this video will clear your doubts and questions.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftsGGGBYMrs&feature=youtu.be
01/08/23, 9:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I have shared all four videos with you, these videos shall take you around 30 minutes of time if you have a smooth internet connection.

02/08/23, 10:33 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Good evening mam  sorry   we were not able to go through the videos  due to bad network

03/08/23, 2:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sibonokuhle.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for letting me know that, I understand, however, in order to move forward with the discussion, you will have to go through the videos, so may I know if by today 09.00 pm, you will be able to go through the videos?
03/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Good afternoon madam Kirti thank you for understanding we will try to go through the videos  today
03/08/23, 2:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, let us reconnect today at 09.00 PM.
03/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Oky ma'am
03/08/23, 9:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I hope you are doing well, with regard to our conversation may I know if you were able to go through the videos by now?
03/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Good evening ma'am yes we were able to go through the videos
03/08/23, 9:10 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Greetings ma'am we are doing fine thank and how are you?
03/08/23, 9:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for asking, I am doing great. So, could you please share your understanding of the 4 videos? <This message was edited>
03/08/23, 9:23 pm - +263 77 765 0076: I understood that a student has to work , be open minded , teachable and be able to follow instructions.I also understand Edoofa put a lot of time and effort to select good schools for Edoofians
03/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding, I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

In the first class, founders talk about two important qualities, which are open-mindedness and following instructions. 

You also understand that the vision of Edoofa for all the Edoofians is to see them all be successful in their career paths and make them more responsible and independent. 

The most essential characteristic is the ability to follow instructions as well as to be cooperative. Edoofa's vision is for the students to have employment and some skills to be the leaders of Tomorrow.
03/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Talking about the third class, yes, as you got to know that Edoofa's founders have invested over 10 years in identifying good schools, colleges, and universities. As a result, the founders advise students to have the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to succeed in the job market. In conclusion, all schools, colleges, and universities under the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria and checkpoints.
03/08/23, 9:28 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Another thing I could see from your answer is that you learned how Edoofa puts its students above other students to achieve their dreams. How much time and effort is put into finding colleges and universities that are qualified and not just ones that are business-based. 

You did understand that the Statement of Purpose (SOP) is a subjective document used by a student to communicate with or convince the admission board or school. The statement of purpose entails students’ skills, strengths, achievements in the past, vision, and dreams; why they opted to take a particular course; why one is seeking admission; and why one needs to be considered.
03/08/23, 9:37 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes I did  understand the SOP
03/08/23, 9:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. *Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle (Messages from the founder's office), and hence we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.*
03/08/23, 10:00 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Oky madam
03/08/23, 10:01 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Oky ma'am
03/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University which provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, it is required that you complete the following two tasks by Tomorrow at 09.00 pm.
03/08/23, 10:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. Once done, Kindly share the screenshot of the last page when the statement of purpose form is submitted.

https://goo.gl/forms/iWss6zPuOFbnGTXK2
03/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: 2. I am sharing two documents with you. Kindly go through both documents and submit your responses to the course document here in the group. Make sure you research well before starting the task. All the best!
03/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: <Media omitted>
03/08/23, 10:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Along with that, please share the following documents with us as they are required for your university application preparation:

*1. O-Level Results*

*2. Identity proof (International Traveling Passport or National ID or Birth Certificate)*
03/08/23, 10:07 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Oky that you ma'am
03/08/23, 10:09 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, let us reconnect tomorrow at 09.00 PM. I hope by that time you will be able to fill out the SOP form and complete the tasks.
03/08/23, 10:10 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Yes ma'am
03/08/23, 10:13 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, have a  great night.
03/08/23, 10:15 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Same to you
04/08/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 765 0076: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 765 0076: <Media omitted>

04/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 765 0076: 2 The difference between rights and duties is that a right is a power or a claim possessed by an individual to do something whilst a duty is an obligation to do or to omit something.A right is an interest recognised and protected by the state whilst a duty is an obligation created and imposed by the state .Another difference between rights and duties is that rights are given by the state to its citizens for self development whereas duties are  responsibilities stipulated by the state to its citizens to maintain law and order.


The difference between human rights and civil rights is that human rights are rights that one acquires by being alive whilst civil rights are rights that one acquires by being part of being a legal member of a certain political state .Civil rights are proclaimed by the government for the citizens of that country whilst human rights are derived from natural law .
04/08/23, 9:44 pm - +263 77 765 0076: 3 .A prosecutor is  a lawyer who defends the prosecution , the prosecutor  serves the people . A prosecutor works for the state and in cases involving criminal charges he/she works for the state . Whilst an attorney is a lawyer who represents a client in court.In criminal disputes attorneys provide clients with  representation and advice . The main difference between an attorney and a prosecutor is that a prosecutor determines whether to charge  an individual for a crime and works to prove that person's crime whilst an attorney offers professional advisor or advocates in legal matters.
04/08/23, 9:45 pm - +263 77 765 0076: 4 Out of the three law branches Civil, Criminal and Corporate,the branch that I am mostly interested in is Civil law .The reason being that it is more lucrative .Since Civil law is about conflict resolution and ensuring that disputes between individuals does not escalate to violent confrontations , it encourages cooperation between society members thus creating a safe environment for everyone .
04/08/23, 9:46 pm - +263 77 765 0076: 5 As a lawyer one should possess different and unique skills such as problem solving , communication skills,writing skills ,creativity,analytic skills , organisation and teamwork amongst other skill .I am proud to say that I possess some of the skills that make a good and successful lawyer such as communication skills , teamwork, creativity, teamwork amongst  others .When I was in high school me and my teammates in science club managed to successfully make a stove that used cow dung as its source of energy.This whole experience prove my creative, communication and teamwork skills as I was able to communicate and work with my team to successfully create and complete that stove with the little resources we had at a boarding school .
04/08/23, 10:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good evening Parents and Sibonokuhle.

I hope you are doing well, thank you for sharing the SOP form, academic documents and the academic interview questions, however, question 1 is yet to answer, may I know by when will you be able to share that?

04/08/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 765 0076: <Media omitted>
04/08/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Here is the audio mam
04/08/23, 11:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing question 1, however, Since it is past our available working hours, we shall reconnect tomorrow at 10.00 am. I hope you will be available.
04/08/23, 11:07 pm - +263 77 765 0076: Oky thank you ma'am
05/08/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: So, out of all the offer letters you receive, you will have to make a decision on which university you would like to study at, considering its ranking and your affordability, and then reserve your seat with that particular university.
05/08/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: *In order to reserve the scholarship seat, a student is supposed to pay a part of their university fee, which is also known as the registration fee. The amount is usually between $500 and $750, and the university will give them a few weeks (two to four weeks) of time to pay the same fee, reserve/lock their scholarship seat with them, and complete their registration process.*
05/08/23, 10:43 am - Kirti Edoofa: Usually, this registration fee that a student pays is an additional cost, but for Edoofians, it is not an additional cost, instead, it is a part of their first-year tuition fee paid while they are in their home country to reserve their scholarship seat with the university. I believe your counselor also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions right?
05/08/23, 10:45 am - +263 77 765 0076: Yes ma'am
05/08/23, 10:49 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is Great, now that you know about the registration fee better, let me also explain it to you with the help of an example -

I'm sure you remember that the cost of degree education in India is $6000 to $8000 per year, but because you are an Edoofian, you are eligible for a scholarship on your tuition fee, and this cost comes down to just $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food cost, accommodation cost, and other small basic expenses. Is that understood?
05/08/23, 10:54 am - +263 77 765 0076: Yes
05/08/23, 10:55 am - Kirti Edoofa: That is wonderful to hear. Now, to understand the registration process better, let us assume the university which you have chosen for your higher education has the following fee structure after scholarship.

Tuition fee - $1800 per annum
Hostel Fee (Food, Accommodation, and other basic expenses) -  $1000 per annum
Registration fee - $750, deadline two weeks.
Total Fee, Tuition Fee $1800 + Hostel fee $1000 = $2800 per annum

I hope it is clear.
05/08/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 765 0076: Yes it is
05/08/23, 11:13 am - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As your registration fee due is $750, you will have to pay the same as per the deadline given by the university to reserve your scholarship seat, and when you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which was $2800.

So, the balance fee you will have to pay after coming to India will be $2800-$750 = $2050 and can be paid in two installments of $1025 at a gap of 6 months. 
 
After the registration fee is paid, the students will receive the Admission Acceptance Letter, and the same will be used for securing admission as well as the student VISA.

I hope you are following?
05/08/23, 11:18 am - +263 77 765 0076: Yes ma'am
05/08/23, 11:20 am - Kirti Edoofa: Great! So, now do you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
05/08/23, 11:23 am - +263 77 643 0351: Morning mam so for now we will wait for the acceptance letter  in order to pay  the registration fee
05/08/23, 11:24 am - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, please you are correct. May I know if you have any other queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what will be the costs?
05/08/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 765 0076: I don't have any queries
05/08/23, 11:28 am - +263 77 643 0351: Let's say maybe you fail to pay the admission fees in time due to some misfortunes  maybe that may have befallen the family will the university give us more time?
05/08/23, 11:33 am - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for your query, however, may I know why you think that you will fail to pay the admission fee?
05/08/23, 11:43 am - +263 77 643 0351: I'm not saying  we will fail just asking  mam
05/08/23, 12:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, in such cases, after having a discussion with the parents and understanding the concern, if the concern is genuine we *try* to have a conversation with the Officials and Board members for an extension *under consideration.*
05/08/23, 12:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, may I know if we are still connected with each other?
05/08/23, 1:07 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am thank you for the explanation it's clear now
05/08/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, now, as you are clear about the admission process, I will now encourage you to inform your family of the financial requirements so they can work in the right direction on them. Since your university admission is for the August 2024 intake, we will reconnect with you after August 2023 to start your admission process. I hope by then your parents will be mentally and financially prepared to proceed with your next steps as well. 

In the meantime, for you to use the next few months wisely, we will start with your EWYL Program by Tomorrow so that you can work and earn scholarship credits simultaneously which will further help your parents in the financial preparation as well.
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Oky thank you ma'am
05/08/23, 1:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome.

18/10/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to know that. Could you please share your understanding of the registration process on the University Admission so that I can get to know that if we are on the same page?
18/10/23, 8:43 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Once you receive letter of Intent one has to register and reserve a seat with the university by paying  registration of a out $500 to $750
18/10/23, 8:44 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I can clearly see that you have understood the process really well. Moving forward I would like to inquire if you have any queries or concerns that you would like to share regarding the registration process?
18/10/23, 8:45 pm - +263 71 247 9106: No ma'am
18/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
18/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
18/10/23, 8:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As we embark on this exciting journey, we have received a special endowment for the students of the 2024 admission intake, and rest assured that we are working tirelessly to provide you with the most affordable and high-quality education possible. Your aspirations are our driving force, and together, we will shape a brighter future.
18/10/23, 11:10 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings, I was looking forward to receiving a response from you, but it appears that you are presently unavailable. Given that our working hours for today have come to an end and considering it has been a long day, I'll reach out to you again tomorrow at 02:30 p.m. I hope this timing is convenient for you and that you'll be accessible for our scheduled session without any delay. Wishing you a pleasant evening.
19/10/23, 11:21 am - +263 71 247 9106: Greetings Ms Kirti about the statement of entry I can't find it
19/10/23, 12:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sibonokuhle.

I trust you are in good health thank you for sharing that, in that case, may I know if you will be able to connect with your school and ask them for a letter of recommendation for your A- level which states the subject combination as well.
19/10/23, 12:51 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Afternoon ma'am I may be able to go to my school but not any time soon
19/10/23, 12:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I understand, in that case, I would suggest you connect with your school teacher and they can share the picture of the letter of recommendation or your statement of entry and you can share that with us, this will save you time that you would have spent to visit the school, does this plan sounds acceptable?
19/10/23, 1:02 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes I will try contacting my teacher
19/10/23, 1:04 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright, great in the meantime may I know if you are available to continue with the discussion?
19/10/23, 1:10 pm - +263 71 247 9106: I am available
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing. With great pride, I would like to highlight that this Endowment is a gift of support extended with the intention of assisting our Edoofians. Under this Endowment, you will enjoy various benefits aimed at easing the financial burden associated with your higher education costs.
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *Benefits of Endowment Program - 2024 Students*

1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.

2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.

3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.

4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *For students who are yet to write their A-Level Exams, this endowment plans brings three additional advantages:*

5. If a student doesn't attain a minimum of 2 passing grades in the A-level Examination and plans to take a gap year for retaking the exams, they will be able to take admission for the 2025 intake.

6. If a student doesn't achieve a minimum of 2 passes in the A-Level Examination, they will have the opportunity to switch to a Diploma Program. This ensures they don't lose a year and they can continue with their higher education in 2024.

7. If a student fails to attain a minimum of 2 passing grades and decides to discontinue their education, then the student will be guaranteed an earning under the EWYL program of the amount equal to their registration fee and enrollment fee along with certificates of various job-oriented projects.
19/10/23, 1:12 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.
19/10/23, 1:26 pm - +263 71 247 9106: I have reviewed the benefits
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the students A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and his/her Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive his/her letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where his/her scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete his/her registration formalities, you will be presented with his/her Official Admission Letter with the help of which he/she will be able to apply for the student visa.
19/10/23, 1:27 pm - Kirti Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means Sibonokuhle, as an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing his/her seat before the competition even begins. He/She will be the trailblazer among his/her peers, firmly positioning his/her as a frontier person in this endeavor.
19/10/23, 2:00 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oh okay
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
19/10/23, 2:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 2:03 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*
 
I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
19/10/23, 2:06 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
19/10/23, 2:09 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45 day period.*
 
I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
19/10/23, 2:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 02, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 02, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 02, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - +263 71 247 9106: No ma'am I have nothing to inquire about
19/10/23, 2:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Great. Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
19/10/23, 3:08 pm - +263 71 247 9106: My A'level results are out I finished A'level Lastyear
19/10/23, 3:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing that with me, in that case, may I know by when will you be able to share them with us here?
19/10/23, 3:15 pm - +263 71 247 9106: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:16 pm - +263 71 247 9106: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 3:36 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your A-level results. I empathize with the fact that students may occasionally find themselves in a state of uncertainty or confusion. However, considering that you currently have your examination results with you, it's worth highlighting that the first four advantages mentioned earlier are particularly pertinent and relevant to you. I hope you are clear here?
19/10/23, 4:00 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 4:03 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
19/10/23, 4:22 pm - +263 71 247 9106: No ma'am
19/10/23, 4:24 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. As your guardian, I am sure your parents are excited to initiate the process? Currently, 37 students have already secured their seats, leaving 63 positions available for this month. Let's begin our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you excited for the next steps and for your offer letter?
19/10/23, 6:12 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes ma'am
19/10/23, 6:14 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. With this, let's conclude our conversation for today, wish you a blessed day ahead and please extend our regards to your family as well.

The universities would take three to five days of time to *evaluate your application* after which if they accept your application for a scholarship, they would send you a scholarship offer letter. 

In the offer letter, their scholarship quantum, per annum tuition fee, accommodation fee, food cost, registration fee, and the deadline date for the registration fee due dates will be mentioned.
19/10/23, 6:49 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky ma'am
14/11/23, 10:48 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This message was deleted
14/11/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Evening, Parents and Sibonokuhle,

I hope this message finds you in good health and high spirits. It is a pleasure to reconnect with you today, and I am excited to share an important update with you.

Since our last discussion, the admissions team has been working diligently to process your scholarship application for universities in India under the Endowment plan. I am pleased to inform you that your application has been accepted by one of the leading universities, *Galgotias University* in India, and they have decided to offer you a scholarship.
14/11/23, 10:49 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The university will be mailing you the official offer letter shortly. However, since we received it in advance, we wanted to share this wonderful news with you and provide a head start on our discussions. I kindly request you to take your time to thoroughly review the letter. We will have a detailed discussion about its contents tomorrow at 05:30 PM.

In the meantime, I recommend that you make note of any questions or concerns that may arise as you review the letter. By setting a specific time, we can ensure that one of your family representatives will be available to connect with us.
14/11/23, 10:50 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This discussion will be an opportunity for me to assist you in gaining a better understanding of the remaining contents of your offer letter, addressing any queries you may have, and providing guidance on the requirements for the rest of your admission journey.

To schedule our discussion, please confirm your availability for the proposed time. If this time is not convenient for you, please share your availability within the window from 05:30 PM to 09:00 PM, and we will arrange a suitable connection time accordingly.

15/11/23, 6:37 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Greetings to you too may I know if you are available to connect with us now?
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. As we proceed with today's discussion, we will get into the details of this specific offer letter. I will guide you through the admission process, explain how it was carried out, and provide information about the steps you need to take to secure the scholarship offer.
15/11/23, 6:40 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The majority of your questions will be addressed during our discussion. If, by the end of our conversation, you still have any unresolved queries, we will certainly address those as well. I hope this approach works for you, and we can look forward to our discussion?
15/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Oky
15/11/23, 6:42 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Noted ok
15/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that you are all set to discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University. Rest assured that I will discuss the letter with you in detail and help you with the queries you have as well.
15/11/23, 6:42 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In order to commence our discussion and ensure that you have a clear understanding of the letter, could you please take another look at it and provide the following information so we can begin with our discussion-	

1. What’s your per semester tuition fee after the scholarship, as mentioned in the letter?
2. What’s the Standard Duration of your course?
3. What’s the Admission and Procedure Fee (One-Time Payable)?
4) You’ll also notice the ‘Registration Fee’ mentioned in the letter- a part of the total fee which you’re supposed to pay now. Can you look and tell me that as well?
15/11/23, 6:49 pm - +263 71 247 9106: 1.$900
2.5years ,10semesters
3. $300
4.$750
15/11/23, 6:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Yes, that is absolutely correct and thank you for sharing your responses. As outlined in your offer letter, your course is a five-year program, with each academic year consisting of two semesters, totaling 10 semesters for your degree. 

With the scholarship offered, your tuition fee per semester reduces to $900, which means your annual tuition fee (calculated as $900 * 2) is $1800. I hope this clarifies the tuition fee structure for you?
15/11/23, 6:52 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am pleased that we've been able to make progress. Moving forward, I would like to help you with a concise overview of the two accommodation options available at Galgotias University -
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *1. On-Campus Accommodation*

The Hostels at Galgotias University have different categories available as mentioned in your offer letter and the pricing for every room is different. 

So, for the Hostels, when the students come and report, they can see the room for themselves and select which room they want. The per annum on-campus accommodation fee for a three-seater AC room is $2000 and for the two-seater, AC room is $2500 and this includes the food cost as well.
15/11/23, 6:54 pm - Kirti Edoofa: *2. Off-Campus Accommodation*

As a student, if you want, you can opt for accommodation outside the campus as well and it would be a bit more affordable. 

- You will be able to seek guidance from the university officials and they will assist you in staying off campus at the university-approved accommodations, the cost for the same will be around $1200 per annum with the self-cooking facility. 

- If you wish to save more on accommodation expenses, you as a student can also go for accommodation independently and further reduce the cost of accommodation to $800 per annum including the cost of food and basic living expenses. <This message was edited>
15/11/23, 7:02 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Since it seems like off campus accommodation is more affordable are there any disadvantages of living off campus
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: No, please all our Edoofians prefer staying off campus. I'd like to emphasize that when it comes to off-campus accommodations, the convenience factor is truly outstanding. These housing options are strategically located within walking distance of the university campus, ensuring that students can easily commute to and from their classes. Along with that, all the basic facilities such as WiFi, Water Purifier, AC, etc. are included in the facilities, please.
15/11/23, 7:11 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Furthermore, it's important to note that all these accommodations are situated within gated communities, which adds an extra layer of security and peace of mind. To bolster security even further, there is 24-hour CCTV surveillance in place, creating a safe and secure environment for students. I hope this gives you the requires assurance in terms of safety and security, right?
15/11/23, 7:19 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 7:20 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is great to hear that you're following our conversation closely. I am sure you can see that Galgotias University values students' well-being and takes a thoughtful approach to accommodation arrangements. 

They understand the significance of students feeling comfortable in their environment to excel academically. Instead of imposing choices, the university allows students to visit the campus, assess their options, and make informed decisions about whether they prefer on-campus or off-campus accommodation. 

I hope this clarifies the university's approach to accommodation and transportation for you?
15/11/23, 7:21 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 8:01 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Moving forward, as you can see in your offer letter, you have the examination fee of $100 which is due every semester making it $200 for the entire year.

May I know if you are clear with this so that we can move forward with the registration fee due as well?
15/11/23, 8:23 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am l am clear
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alright please, it is reassuring to see you following through. Please allow me to share some great news with you. As you can see, the admission and processing fee of $300, mentioned in the letter, has been entirely waived under the Early Registration Scheme and the Endowment Plan. This means it will not be added to your overall cost of education.
15/11/23, 8:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In line with this, as stated in the letter, it is outlined that a student must pay the registration fee of $750 within 15 days to guarantee their scholarship seat at the university. Therefore, *your deadline for securing your scholarship seat falls on November 28th, 2023*. I hope we are together so far?
15/11/23, 8:28 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Following ma'am
15/11/23, 8:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: In reference to our previous discussion and the advantages granted to you through the Endowment plan, I believe you recall that you are entitled to receive a $150 grant applicable to the registration fee. Additionally, there is a flexible payment plan in place to facilitate the payment of this fee. Would you like me to explain how this works?
15/11/23, 8:30 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am explain
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me help you with this. Given the $150 grant, Edoofa will cover that amount on your behalf, as a parent/student you will be responsible for the remaining $600 of the registration fee. This $600 can be conveniently paid in two installments as outlined below:

1. An initial payment of *$300 before the first deadline date of November 28th, 2023* (which is 15 days from the offer letter release).

2. A subsequent payment of *$300 before the second deadline date of December 28th, 2023* (which is one month from the first deadline date).
15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This payment plan offers flexibility and ensures your registration is completed smoothly. Alternatively, if you are financially prepared and wish to expedite the process, you have the option to make the full payment of $600 within 15 working days, before November 28th, 2023. 

I hope this option is clear, and now we are in agreement regarding the details mentioned in the offer letter?
15/11/23, 8:34 pm - +263 77 643 0351: We are in agreement mam it's clear
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now that we are clear with the payment plan, let us also move forward to the modes of payment - 

The payment for the fee is to be made to the account details mentioned on the offer letter, however since the same is an Indian account, you won't be able to find the same in Zimbabwe, a deposit into that account can be made if you have a foreign currency exchange bank account.
15/11/23, 8:35 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Hence. There are alternative modes available as well, to help you with the most feasible mode, if you don't mind me asking, may I know where do you stay in Zimbabwe? Are you residing in Harare?
15/11/23, 8:37 pm - +263 77 643 0351: We are in Bulawayo mam
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Thank you for letting me know. If you or someone on your behalf is able to make the payment from Harare, in that case, the most feasible mode of international payment would be to make the payment through our associate Mr. Rajan, who is also residing in Harare. You can meet him and make the payment of your fee to him in the form of cash.
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: He is helping students process the payments of their university fees at a 7% transfer rate which is comparatively low when compared to other modes of payment. The payment can be made in the form of cash and you will be able to meet him at 76 Broadlands Road, Emerald Hill, Harare. Let me share his contact details with you so that you can connect with him and coordinate with him yourself.
15/11/23, 8:38 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Mr. Rajan - Harare.vcf (file attached)
15/11/23, 8:44 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Oky ma'am noted this is one is different l thought we will use the same payment methods  which  we used last time where we deposited the money  to Mr Shorwi kawadza here in Bulawayo
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Once you make the payment to Mr. Rajan, he will issue a payment receipt that includes all relevant details such as the student's name, depositor's name, payment amount, payment purpose, and more. This receipt can be shared with us for payment confirmation and serves as proof of payment.

It is important to note that Mr. Rajan is a trusted businessman based in Harare and is an associate of Edoofa. With that said, I would like to inform you that you should only make the payment through Mr. Rajan if it is convenient for you and aligns with your preferences.
15/11/23, 8:45 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Alternatively, you can revert to the payment method you previously used to make a cash deposit through Mr. Shorwi FBC Bank for your enrollment fee.

If you prefer to use this same payment method for your university registration fee, you are welcome to do so as it remains a feasible option. Please keep in mind that the international transfer charges for this method amount to 12.5% of the sum you plan to send. Would you like me to provide the account details once again for your reference?
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 8:58 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Let me do the same. If making the payment through Mr. Shorwi is a convenient method for you, you can use the same mode of payment to pay your registration fee as well. Let me share the account details with you once again for your reference -

Bank Name: FBC
Branch: Mutare
Account Holder Name: Kawadza Shorwi
Account Number: 5333 0380 0918 0214
Contact Number: +263 77 364 0738
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Thank you ma'am
15/11/23, 8:59 pm - Kirti Edoofa: You are welcome, now moving forward, to facilitate a simpler understanding, let me provide a summary of all the fee components we have discussed and share the total cost of education that you are expected to incur at Galgotias University:

1. Per Annum Tuition Fee - $1,800
2. Per Annum Examination Fee - $200
3. Per Annum Off-Campus Accommodation Fee (Independent Accommodation Options) - $800

Total per annum cost of education: $1,800 + $200 + $800 = $2,800
15/11/23, 9:01 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Noted thank you madam
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to see that you were able to follow through with our last message. Now that we have established your total annual education cost as $2800, let me also guide you on how we can make your education more affordable.
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Ideally, the entire annual fee is expected to be paid by the student. However, students enrolled in the Edoofa Program have the added advantage of the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program. As you are aware, through this program, students can earn scholarship credits ranging from $800 to $1200 in a year, which they can then apply towards covering a portion of their fees. This opportunity can significantly reduce the financial burden of education.
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is essential to understand that the scholarship credits earned through the Earn While You Learn Program are not limited to a maximum of $1200. In fact, there is no upper limit to the amount of scholarship credits a student can earn.
15/11/23, 9:08 pm - Kirti Edoofa: The more effort and dedication a student puts into their work, the more they can earn to support their higher education. It is a flexible and dynamic opportunity that allows students to determine the extent to which they can fund their education through their hard work. I hope you have understood this?
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Understood mam
15/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With this said, let us also get into how the EWYL Program can benefit you as a parent. Imagine that you with your hard work earns scholarship credits amounting to $1000 within a year through the EWYL Program.
15/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: With these earned credits, you can use this $1000 to cover a portion of your annual fee, which is $2800. As a result, the remaining balance for the year would be reduced to $2800 - $1000 = $1800, which will need to be paid by you as parents/guardians.
15/11/23, 9:21 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This illustrates how you can effectively make your education more affordable and alleviate the financial strain on you as a family. Does this clarify the EWYL credits adjustment process for you and demonstrate how the program can be advantageous?
15/11/23, 9:21 pm - +263 77 643 0351: It's clear mam
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It is reassuring to know that we share the same understanding, and I have every confidence that you will dedicate yourself to the EWYL Program, diligently working towards reducing the cost of your education while balancing your academics. Your mentors will undoubtedly provide you with valuable guidance to help you reach your academic and financial goals.
15/11/23, 9:22 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Now, that you have all the details with you and understand the letter better, I would like to enquire if there are any queries on your mind that you would like to ask before I share the university insights with you and we conclude our conversation for today?
15/11/23, 9:31 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Everything is clear
15/11/23, 9:33 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now to attend to last part of our discussion, let me share a few insights into Galgotias University with you -
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Galgotias University, situated in Delhi NCR, boasts an impressive academic reputation, ranking among the top 100 universities in India. One of its notable achievements is obtaining NAAC A+ Accreditation in the First Cycle, setting the highest standard for academic excellence.
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: A significant factor contributing to Galgotias University's consistent recognition as a top institution is its 'students-first' philosophy. This approach prioritizes the well-being and success of its students and aligns with Edoofa's values and mission.
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: One of the university's standout features is its dedication to maintaining a low student-to-faculty ratio. This approach ensures that students receive ample personal attention and mentoring, fostering a supportive and nurturing learning environment.
15/11/23, 9:34 pm - Kirti Edoofa: For your convenience, you can explore the university's official website through this link: [Galgotias University Government Recognition] (https://galgotiasuniversity.edu.in/government-recognition).

15/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: I am glad to hear that before we conclude our conversation for today, I would like to emphasise the importance of sharing your offer letter with your family and engaging in a detailed discussion with them to ensure they have a clear understanding of its contents.
15/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: This is undoubtedly an exciting moment for you and your family, as you have received a scholarship offer from an Indian university, bringing you one step closer to realizing your dream of pursuing education abroad.
15/11/23, 9:51 pm - Kirti Edoofa: As you have your conversation, I recommend keeping a record of any questions or concerns that arise. This will enable us to have a comprehensive discussion during our next scheduled meeting which will be on the 18th of Novemeber. We can address any queries you may have and outline the next steps for your admission process. I hope this sounds good to you?
15/11/23, 9:56 pm - +263 77 643 0351: Yes ma'am
15/11/23, 9:57 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Have a great night ahead and do convey my regards to your family as well.

17/11/23, 12:32 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good afternoon Parents and Sibonokuhle.

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for letting me know that, I believe it must be a clerical error by the university since we did upload your A-level results as well, please do not worry the team will get the error updated.
17/11/23, 1:01 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Oky ma'am thank you

I've taken the time to reschedule our discussion for tomorrow, where we'll address all your queries and concerns, so there's no need to worry. Wishing you a pleasant night, and looking forward to our conversation on Monday.
19/11/23, 3:23 am - +263 71 247 9106: Greetings ma'am I am glad that you are feeling better
20/11/23, 1:02 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good Afternoon Parents and Sibonokuhle!

Receiving the university's offer letter is indeed a significant milestone, and I can imagine the excitement that must have accompanied the anticipation of this moment.

Looking forward, I would like to enquire if you and your family had an opportunity to review and discuss the offer letter from Galgotias University as a collective?
20/11/23, 1:06 pm - +263 71 247 9106: Good afternoon ma'am yes we did review and discuss the offer letter
20/11/23, 1:29 pm - Kirti Edoofa: It's wonderful to hear that you've had a family discussion about the offer letter, and I am confident that you must all be delighted to witness the positive strides being made toward realizing your higher education goals in India.

As you move forward, I am curious to know how your family conversation went. What are your thoughts and feelings regarding the discussion?
21/11/23, 12:25 pm - Kirti Edoofa: Good day, Parents and Sibonokuhle,
