31/08/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: I would also like to inform you for the inconveniences. I was not able to respond you yesterday since the organisation was closed on the eve of our Indian festival _Raksha Bandhan_�

Raksha Bandhan is a Hindu festival celebrated to honor the special bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a sacred thread called a "rakhi" around their brothers' wrists, symbolizing their love and protection. In return, the brothers promise to look after and support their sisters. It's a day of joy, gift-giving, and strengthening the sibling relationship.
31/08/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 815 0343: Yes
31/08/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me share a glimpse of how I celebrated it🫱🏻‍🫲🏼
31/08/23, 8:42 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 8:44 am - +263 78 815 0343: Ohh wow that's nice
31/08/23, 8:45 am - +263 78 815 0343: I wish it is celebrated this side as well 😊
31/08/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Indeed Sanelisiwe, this is an amazing way to maintain ties with our family and I absolutely love these events because they help us in maintaining that bond.
31/08/23, 8:54 am - Saloni Edoofa: And coming to our journey, I would like to say that I am thrilled to be your mentor. Before connecting with you today, I was given the responsibility for your application which I reviewed along with gathering feedback about you from your counselor and the admissions team. Some key aspects of your application, particularly *your desire* to study abroad, were highlighted. In my long-standing career, working with young motivated students who have a vision of *collective growth* has always been my interest. I am certain that working with you will undoubtedly be a *rewarding experience* as well.
31/08/23, 8:55 am - +263 78 815 0343: Indeed it will be
31/08/23, 9:02 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I can see that there are some other people who have joined the group besides you. May I learn a little about each of them? I would appreciate it if we could engage in a quick conversation and get to know each other a bit.
31/08/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 815 0343: That's my father who joined the group
31/08/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so happy to welcome him to the group, I am sure he will witness tremendous growth and splendid transition in you as we move ahead in this journey🚀
31/08/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: So Sanelisiwe, I would like to begin this journey by knowing you beyond the _Statement of Purpose._ Can you share with me what are your long-term goals and how do you think this EWYL Program will help you in achieving them? <This message was edited>
31/08/23, 9:13 am - +263 78 815 0343: Thank you
31/08/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 815 0343: My long term is to become a successful lawyer...to earn a good and secure living and finish my high education.....EWYL will help me achieve my goals financially as it is going to contribute to my education
31/08/23, 9:21 am - Saloni Edoofa: That's an incredibly inspiring vision you have there! Pursuing a career in law and achieving higher education are noble goals, and it's clear you're determined to make them a reality. The fact that you recognize EWYL as a valuable resource to support your education is commendable. Remember, every step you take with dedication and passion brings you closer to your dreams. Stay focused, work hard, and use this opportunity to its fullest.
31/08/23, 9:22 am - Saloni Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
31/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 815 0343: No i don't understand
31/08/23, 9:24 am - +263 78 815 0343: Thank you ..I will work very hard
31/08/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please be rest assured that I am always there with you in this academic journey of yours.
31/08/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: Let me add to your understanding, that the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
31/08/23, 9:29 am - Saloni Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
31/08/23, 9:30 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am so glad that you actively share your views and ideas with me and take big steps every day in our scheduled sessions.
I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
31/08/23, 9:31 am - +263 78 815 0343: I now understand
31/08/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay
01/09/23, 9:38 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
Hope you are doing well.

I hope you're doing good.

I am absolutely overwhelmed with joy as I take you on a journey through the highlights of our recent orientation event for our "Proud Edoofians" at our partner universities🤩. This event was a wonderful experience, with Team Edoofa meeting the most amazing bunch of students. We embarked on a delightful journey together, engaging in discussions about our weekly lessons, engaging activities, exciting projects, the path to employability, and the importance of discipline.🚀

We didn't stop there; our hearts swelled with pride as we had the privilege of not only inspiring but also educating our Edoofians about the vibrant and diverse culture of India🇮🇳. And to top it all off, we concluded the event with an explosive burst of happiness, as our Edoofians danced, sang, and lived in the moment. We captured countless pictures of these unforgettable moments, and I'm so happy to share some of these heartwarming memories with you! 🎉📸
07/09/23, 12:05 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Please note that our session will be held tomorrow at our respective times.

Let's begin with our session🚨
08/09/23, 8:41 am - Saloni Edoofa: @263788150343 @263773618683
08/09/23, 8:42 am - +263 78 815 0343: Good morning

08/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing good, thank you.
08/09/23, 8:49 am - Saloni Edoofa: Starting from here, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/09/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay thank you
08/09/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Since we will be connected for the longest period and I will be your mentor, your guide, and your friend throughout your journey with Edoofa Program, we will be connected even when you are here in India. 
Let me share about myself…
08/09/23, 8:57 am - Saloni Edoofa: Please let me know if you face any problems while viewing the video.
08/09/23, 8:58 am - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>

08/09/23, 9:12 am - Saloni Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

19/09/23, 8:49 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay
19/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
19/09/23, 8:50 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
19/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
19/09/23, 8:51 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

21/09/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay

I am sure that *tomorrow* in our scheduled session (08:30-09:30 AM) you will come up with same excitement and inquisitiveness.
22/09/23, 8:53 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings of the day!
How are you?

Let's begin with our session⏳
22/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 815 0343: Im fine
22/09/23, 9:06 am - +263 78 815 0343: Yes let's begin
22/09/23, 9:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: You did not come for the session and say "ma'am let's begin with the session". Why so, Sanelisiwe?
22/09/23, 9:16 am - +263 78 815 0343: Sorry ma'am I got held up with something ...and also me network was bad
22/09/23, 9:18 am - Saloni Edoofa: Okay no worries!
22/09/23, 9:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: So, now I am going to share certain ways that have turned out to be effective for most of our students!
22/09/23, 9:19 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay thank you
22/09/23, 9:19 am - Saloni Edoofa: *A] Through WhatsApp community groups:*

*STEP 1*: You’re supposed to form a WhatsApp group and you have to name them-
*STUDENT NAME/MENTOR NAME/DATE ON WHICH THE GROUP IS FORMED*
For eg: In your case, it will be-
*Sanelisiwe/Saloni/22SEPT2023*
22/09/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: *STEP 2*: We need to find the *right student* (applicant) that can be a part of the group.

The main purpose behind forming the group is that we _reach out to a large pool of students so that we can tell them about Edoofa and share the right information with them_. By following this step we make sure that before the counseling session, they are all well-equipped with the information about Edoofa and have a smooth counseling session thereafter.
22/09/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
22/09/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
22/09/23, 9:20 am - Saloni Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
22/09/23, 9:25 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay thank you
22/09/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
22/09/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am ____________, a student selected for the prestigious Edoofa Scholarship Program to pursue my tertiary education in India. I have always dreamed of studying abroad, especially after the recent fee hikes at universities in *Zimbabwe*, where tuition fees range from ZWL 650,000 to ZWL 750,000 per term. When considering the yearly cost, including food and accommodation, it exceeds $2,100 in our beloved Zimbabwe⏫

Today, the internet is a necessity, and I truly realized its importance when preparing for my journey to India. We are all well aware of the expenses we have to bear just to access subpar internet services. During my school days, I used to spend a minimum of $35-$40 a month to ensure I had sufficient internet, which added up to around $450-$500 annually.
22/09/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: *It's remarkable to discover that in India, students value their educational infrastructure so much that they can access a necessity like the internet for around $40 for the entire year.*💥

Conversely, when speaking to my seniors in Zimbabwe, I realized that I might have to compromise on my choice of course due to limited available seats. Furthermore, many seniors are struggling with unemployment after graduating in Zimbabwe
I had a strong desire to support my family through part-time employment during my course, and that's when I learned about the Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA, which offers opportunities to earn between $50 and $100 per month throughout the course.
22/09/23, 9:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: *While pursuing tertiary education in India is more affordable than universities in Zimbabwe, it comes with its own challenges. I diligently followed the 5'S, which played a crucial role in helping me qualify for this scholarship. I urge you to go through these Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors will ask you questions based on the information in the flyer I have attached*

26/09/23, 8:54 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay I want to ask that on project 2 it's only that I should go to schools to do the project but I can also do it to those who already passed their A level but want the opportunity to study abroad???
26/09/23, 8:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: Yes, you can approach all the students who are currently doing their A Level or have passed their A Level. It would be preferred that you reach out to students physically, like telling them during school time and when you are back home in free time but if this is not possible, you can also reach out to them through WhatsApp.
26/09/23, 8:57 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay ma'am thank you
26/09/23, 8:58 am - +263 78 815 0343: So after telling them about the Edoofa scholarship then they fill in the forms ...then I create a group for them
26/09/23, 9:01 am - Saloni Edoofa: See, you can form a WhatsApp group where you will be telling everyone about Edoofa. Now in terms of fetching the members for this group, you can reach out to students in your class, neighbors, peers, and cousins. This can be done physically or virtually. You tell them about Edoofa, ask them to join your WhatsApp group, share everything about Edoofa with them in the group, and then all those interested can DM you to ask for forms. Share the form with them, and then share the filled form with me.
26/09/23, 9:05 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay ma'am thank you very much
26/09/23, 9:07 am - Saloni Edoofa: Do you have any other doubt?

26/09/23, 9:11 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is no deadline for the project.
There is no order in which you have to do the project.
There is no limit on how much you have to do a project.
There is no limit to the number of scholarship credits one can earn through projects.
It's simple, the *more you work on it, the more scholarship credits you earn.*
Moreover, it is important *that you make steady progress every day*.
26/09/23, 9:12 am - +263 78 815 0343: Okay understood

Every school that is happy to be associated with Edoofa does so because of the Edoofa Student community's shared love and passion for advancement. We all work hard, even our young and ambitious students, to guarantee that we all grow together. And it fills us with enormous satisfaction when our students express joy when they learn that they are featured in the newsletter and on social media sites and that they are happy that they are being recognized by their peers. It is the success of everyone who is a part of this wonderful community when they work together. The most successful leaders have a practice of sharing positive affirmations. We've decided to make this an intentional part of our everyday practice. Now that the majority of you are connecting with your mentors three to four times per week, you want to have a daily connection where we can celebrate our status as members of this renowned community of ambitious people. We want to build a conscious reminder of who we are, why we started this journey, and what our ultimate aims are, and a common sentence that can help us rewrite all of these things is the collective community bonding, therefore you must wish and speak out proudly to be an Edoofian every day. Every day, you must text me and say, *"I am a proud Edoofian*.

04/10/23, 8:46 am - Saloni Edoofa: Greetings Sanelisiwe!
How are you?

Please follow the daily ritual for today on the EWYL as it is time for our missed session.
04/10/23, 9:51 am - +263 78 815 0343: Im fine how are you
04/10/23, 9:59 am - Saloni Edoofa: I am doing well, thank you.
04/10/23, 10:00 am - +263 78 815 0343: Sorry ma'am I had technical problems today..my network was very bad

04/10/23, 11:26 am - Saloni Edoofa: I understand that electricity issues and connectivity gaps are not in our hands but I would suggest that you either use the hotspot facility for connecting with me or use someone else device for connecting.
I hope you understand that the direct link to all these is on your session and growth is our priority right.
23/10/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Good morning Sanelisiwe!
How are you?
23/10/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: We will have our session on Wednesday from 09:30-11:00 AM 😊 Please note that I won't be available today due to some personal commitments. On Tuesday, our services will not be operational as we will be observing Dussehra, an exciting Indian festival celebrated with grand effigies, fireworks, and vibrant processions that symbolize the victory of good over evil. 🎉 Dussehra is a dazzling spectacle of lights, dances, and traditions that bring families and communities together while also paying tribute to the epic triumph of Lord Rama over the demon king Ravana. 🏹🔥
23/10/23, 10:00 am - Saloni Edoofa: Dussehra is a Hindu festival with its origins in India, celebrating the victory of good over evil. It is not directly linked to African festivals but shares the universal theme of triumph over malevolence. In diverse African communities, individuals from India or other regions may celebrate Dussehra alongside local festivities, fostering cultural exchange. Immigrants from India in Africa often continue to observe Dussehra, occasionally sharing these traditions with their local communities. While not intrinsically connected, Dussehra's theme of celebrating virtue resonates with the broader notion of triumph over evil found in various African festivals.

07/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hello, my proud edoofian!
Hope you are doing well.

I want to extend my sincere apologies for my absence yesterday. I was entrusted with the responsibility of coordinating the grand orientation event that took place at one of our partner universities. It was an exhilarating experience, and the students displayed their enthusiasm by preparing some delightful surprises for us. This made the event truly worthwhile.
07/11/23, 2:31 pm - Saloni Edoofa: I acknowledge that we missed our sessions last week and yesterday. To make up for this, I have scheduled a special 1.5-hour session tomorrow, during which we will cover all the material we had planned to address. Our session will begin at 09:30 AM and conclude at 11:00 AM. This extended session will help us catch up on everything and ensure we continue making progress as planned.
Also, from Thursday onwards, we will be beginning our preparation for our festival Diwali, therefore our session for tomorrow will also make up for for session that would have been held on Thursday. I am sure you will attend the same on the *EWYL Line tomorrow*

09/11/23, 12:45 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Hey Sanelisiwe!

Hope this message finds you in high spirits! 🌟 As an Indian mentor, I'm thrilled to share that we're amid Diwali, the Festival of Lights. Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: _Greetings of the day!_

Once upon a frosty North Pole night, Santa Claus was feeling particularly mischievous. He decided to become a Secret Santa and spread the magic of surprise! With a twinkle in his eye, he selected a list of students from around the world to receive special gifts. 🎁🌍

In a cozy little town, a group of excited students discovered mysterious packages appearing on their doorsteps. The buzz of curiosity filled the air as they unwrapped their surprise gifts – each one perfectly tailored to their dreams and wishes! 🤩
As the students reveled in the joy of their Secret Santa treasures, Santa Claus chuckled from afar, his heart aglow with the delight of making dreams come true. 💖❄️ Now, the question echoed through the town: "_What do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this festive season?_" 🎄🎅
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 3:40 pm - Saloni Edoofa: Emotions ran high as the students shared their hopes and dreams, igniting a wave of anticipation. From wishes for kindness to dreams of adventure, the excitement was contagious! The air buzzed with the thrill of anticipation as the magic of Secret Santa bound hearts together in the spirit of giving. 🤗💫
So, dear student, *what do YOU wish for from your Secret Santa this year*? 🌟🎄
