You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries.

We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others. In Manicaland we have a total of 18 Schools to name a few St. David’s Girls Bonda, Hartzell High, First Class, First Choice and so on.  Chipinge we have Chibuwe High School, you would be happy to know that the DEO’s of Mutare and Chipinge have their kids under the Edoofa Scholarship. Masvingo we have 24 Schools collaborated with over 300 students from some of the best schools example Pamushana, St. Antony’s, Reformed Church Gutu, Zaka High and many others. The program is also appreciated by the Education Inspector of Bikita Madam Makomeke.We have more than 500 students from Mashonaland (West, Central and East) Province, Midlands Province.  Last but not the Least we also have Schools from Bulawayo and Matebaland South associated with Edoofa. 

Our collaborations with the UCE College Bulawayo adds a feather to the Cap of trust that Edoofa has built in a span of 14 years. 

The Schools, Institutions and Educationists who have made efforts to train the students for this prestigious Scholarship Program are also the Authorized Designatories of EDOOFA in Zimbabawe. 
We have Mr. Shorwi Kawadza (Retd. Headmaster Hartzell), Mr. Charles Jerera (Retd. Ministry of Education), Ms. Christina Rockson (Founder and Principal of Hilltop Christian College in SA) who have shown relentless efforts to guide students on the right path to success.EDOOFA boasts a proud students and parents community of more than 2000 from Zimbabwe who are happy with the quality of education and the employability outcomes.
06/12/23, 7:49 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky noted Ms.Harmehak ,,,so does the scholarship offer free transport
07/12/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
07/12/23, 11:10 am - +263 77 194 8060: Oky Ms .Harnmehak , so what are the terms and conditions for  the Edoofa scholarship
07/12/23, 11:29 am - Harmehak: Can you please elaborate?
07/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however it seems you are occupied, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
07/12/23, 7:59 pm - +263 77 194 8060: What does the edoofa scholarship provide for a student exactly?
08/12/23, 9:01 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
08/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 77 194 8060: What does the edoofa scholarship provide for a student exactly?
08/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: The program offers scholarship on Tuition fee.
08/12/23, 10:18 am - Harmehak: Let me explain to you that there are two kinds of programs that provide assistance to the students because a lot of times parents and students themselves misunderstand what a Scholarship actually means.

*1. Scholarships*
*2. Sponsorships*

Scholarships make education *affordable* for the students by reducing their *Tuition Fees*, now a lot of times parents and students consider that a Domestic Scholarship would be the same as an International Scholarship, but to understand the difference between them, consider yourself applying for an education in your own country with the help of a scholarship. Now after the scholarship when your tuition fee would be reduced, eventually your entire cost of education would be reduced because being a citizen of the country, you wouldn't be required to spend any fees on Accommodation and feeding separately since in that case, students would be staying with their families. However, if I personally plan to study in Zimbabwe with the same scholarship, I would have to incur some costs on Accommodation and Feeding because I am not a Zimbabwean Citizen. So a lot of times parents and students consider International Scholarship and Domestic Scholarship one and the same thing, but in reality, they aren't.

Sponsorships, on the other hand, take care entirely of a student's education, but because Sponsorships are provided by only a few organizations, there are a lot of terms and conditions which a student might need to follow in order to get the sponsorship, the most common term is that a student after completion of the course would have to work for the organization providing the sponsorship for a period of time.
08/12/23, 10:24 am - +263 77 194 8060: Oky so how about the pass rate that's required for one to learn under the Edoofa scholarship
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I would discuss everything in detail with you as we would move ahead in our discussion!
08/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
08/12/23, 12:50 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, however, I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9:30 AM CAT*, as I would be heading for an urgent board meeting, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
09/12/23, 9:31 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
09/12/23, 1:13 pm - Harmehak: Hello everyone, I hope you are in good health.

Since the time you applied for the Edoofa Scholarship Program, I have been expecting proper participation, for your application for Edoofa Scholarship Program, but since you didn’t respond, I am afraid I will have to put a formal closure to your application.

11/12/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: I am glad he is supportive, Tatenda.
11/12/23, 7:50 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
11/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes I'm very confident Ms ,,,so what's the maximum points required
11/12/23, 8:12 pm - Harmehak: Passes are mandatory, however more points surely help you score a greater quantum of scholarship.
11/12/23, 8:13 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky , how about studying constitution law how points am I supposed to get
11/12/23, 8:17 pm - Harmehak: The same please.
11/12/23, 8:19 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
11/12/23, 8:20 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results and A level subject combination with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law ?
11/12/23, 8:31 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Sure thing! 
I have 5 subjects

11/12/23, 8:36 pm - Harmehak: Well that surely well thought off, 

I can see you wish to do well.

On that note, first let me brief you about your desired course.

A course in BA LLB is an exciting one that offers multiple career opportunities. The 5 key positions associated with this course are:

*1) Legal Advisor*
The main role of a legal advisor or legal counsellor is to offer legal advice and work, for organizations and the employees of the organization. Their services can be utilized by the Government, NGOs, other associations or large organizations.  The legal advisors are in-house experts, in contrast to attorneys and supporters who offer their services to society in general. It is often seen that legal advisors were former advocates and therefore their skills and training have to be in accordance with those that are needed for attorneys and advocates.

*2) Lawyer*
As is evident by the title, is a person whose profession is law. There are different specializations for law including Cyber law, Environmental law, Company law, Criminal law and Family Law. Their main job role is to represent their clients in jurisdiction matters. Their work involves a lot of research, including that on the subject and their client’s perspective. They then go on to represent and defend their clients in the court.

*3) Public Prosecutor*
A Public Prosecutor is a criminal lawyer who is hired by the government. He may either be hired by the central or the state government to represent the interests of the state in any criminal trial. Their role starts once the police have investigated and filed the charge sheet in court. The expectation from the Public Prosecutor is that he acts in the interests of the general public and is fair and ethical. The criminal procedure code of 1973 under section 24, outlines the arrangements concerning the Public Prosecutor.

*4) Judge*
This role is considered to be very prestigious by any law student. Immediately after the completion of graduation, an individual can appear for a lower judiciary exam. The age group depending on different states varies between 21 to 35 years. The qualities of righteousness, good ethics and a passion for justice are some of the key qualities needed for this job.

*5) Company Secretary*
This job is for students who want to work in the corporate sector. This job requires a degree from ICSI or the Institute of Company secretaries of India. A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

11/12/23, 9:04 pm - +263 77 194 8060: There are several reasons why I'd like to study abroad rather than in my home country. First, studying abroad provides an opportunity to learn from experts in the field and gain exposure to different perspectives and approaches. Additionally, it's a chance to experience a new culture and learn a new language. Lastly, it will allow me to develop my independence and adaptability, both of which are important skills for any successful lawyer
11/12/23, 9:06 pm - Harmehak: That is wonderful Tatenda, I can see you are aiming at maximum exposure, Tatenda.

Now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination.

11/12/23, 9:15 pm - +263 77 194 8060: I have researched the Indian education system and found that it is one of the largest and most diverse systems in the world. It offers a wide range of educational opportunities, including specialized degrees in engineering, medicine, and law. In addition, India is home to some of the best universities in the world, such as the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Management (IIM). These institutions offer high-quality education and have strong international recognition. Studying in India would give me the chance to learn from some of the best minds
11/12/23, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: Admirable research and knowledge, Tatenda.
11/12/23, 9:16 pm - Harmehak: Alright please, let me add to it, you see over the past 6 years, the Edoofa Scholarship Program is only focused in India, because of the following reasons:

11/12/23, 9:29 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Wowl those are great facts about India
11/12/23, 9:30 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you, Tatenda.

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
11/12/23, 9:34 pm - +263 77 194 8060: No we're not can you share please
11/12/23, 9:34 pm - Harmehak: Alright please
11/12/23, 9:34 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
11/12/23, 9:35 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 13 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
11/12/23, 9:35 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
11/12/23, 9:35 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
11/12/23, 9:41 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky I understand , can you please explain the earn while learning program
11/12/23, 9:44 pm - Harmehak: I shall brief you please.

In simple words Tatenda, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc. <This message was edited>
11/12/23, 9:47 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky that would be very nice
11/12/23, 9:49 pm - Harmehak: What are your thoughts on the same, Tatenda?
11/12/23, 9:51 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes and I wanna be one of the students with a high passing grafe
11/12/23, 9:51 pm - Harmehak: Thats great!
11/12/23, 9:51 pm - Harmehak: Tatenda, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
11/12/23, 9:54 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes I agree with you ,,especially the internet her i is very expensive
11/12/23, 9:56 pm - Harmehak: So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Tatenda?
11/12/23, 9:57 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes
11/12/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
11/12/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
11/12/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
11/12/23, 10:04 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

11/12/23, 10:26 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *Tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours are over, If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
12/12/23, 6:07 am - +263 77 194 8060: Good morning Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 9:20 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
12/12/23, 2:32 pm - Harmehak: @263712789155 

Aere we connected please?
12/12/23, 2:35 pm - +263 71 278 9155: yes we are connected how are u Mam
12/12/23, 2:46 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well, please!

How are you?
12/12/23, 3:06 pm - +263 71 278 9155: very gud and how are u over there
12/12/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: Everything's well please,

You can follow the discussion and participate to conclude the counseling session please.
12/12/23, 3:07 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
12/12/23, 3:16 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Does the student have to pay back the scholarship credits
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Not at all please.
12/12/23, 3:18 pm - Harmehak: Those are the earnings of your hard work.
12/12/23, 3:19 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

12/12/23, 3:22 pm - +263 77 194 8060: So these hard work require manual labour?
12/12/23, 3:26 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Sounds interesting
12/12/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: Did you go through the same, Tatenda?
12/12/23, 3:27 pm - Harmehak: I happened to share the examples as well yesterday!
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky I get it
12/12/23, 3:29 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yah I remember
12/12/23, 3:33 pm - Harmehak: That is great, Tatenda!

So, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
12/12/23, 3:34 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Can you give me just 2 hours please
12/12/23, 3:34 pm - Harmehak: There is a three and a half hour time difference, Tatenda.
12/12/23, 3:35 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky what's the time there
12/12/23, 3:36 pm - Harmehak: It's 7 PM IST.
12/12/23, 3:38 pm - +263 77 194 8060: So lets say by 8:30 I'll be free
12/12/23, 3:41 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted,

I shall expect to hear from within 1.5 hours, Tatenda.
12/12/23, 5:08 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Hie Ms Harmehak I'm back
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Tatenda.
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Tatenda, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
12/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 77 194 8060: I think about $1500 and above
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:12 pm - Harmehak: Tatenda, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
12/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky so what's the due date for U6 students of next year
12/12/23, 5:17 pm - +263 77 194 8060: So we're going to pay $350 admission fee
12/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak changed the group name from "Tatenda_Edoofa(06/12)HP" to "Tatenda_Edoofa(06/12)HP 2025"
12/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
12/12/23, 5:18 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
12/12/23, 5:24 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky so the admission fee will also cover my Visa
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: You would start with the process now itself!
12/12/23, 5:25 pm - Harmehak: *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.*
12/12/23, 5:28 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle.
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities. 

August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.

This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
12/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 5:30 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky but the admission fee for now it can be a challenge because we're about to pay the registration fee next year for my Advanced level examinations
12/12/23, 5:34 pm - Harmehak: Since we do understand the same you are allowed to pay in partial amounts once you are found eligible, Tatenda.
12/12/23, 5:35 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky I'm grateful for that Ms Harmehak
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
12/12/23, 5:37 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Step 6 : Once you are done with the registration fee payment will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
12/12/23, 5:39 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
12/12/23, 5:40 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky how about the transport fee ?
12/12/23, 5:40 pm - Harmehak: You would be briefed about the same as well, Tatenda?
12/12/23, 5:41 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
12/12/23, 5:43 pm - Harmehak: Do connect with Mrs Ruth and connect your guardians with her as well, Tatenda.
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky u mean more like creating a group
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - Harmehak: No please,

You can just call her individually.
12/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
12/12/23, 5:58 pm - +263 77 194 8060: So what's left for me to complete step one
12/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
12/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
12/12/23, 6:05 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

It's been a pleasure guiding you through your career sessions.

The Senior Counselor and Director will make decisions based on your interview and adhere strictly to the given time. Follow instructions diligently, and if the session is completed within the allotted time, your application will proceed.

Happy Family Discussion!
Stay Blessed!
12/12/23, 7:19 pm - Harmehak: Both you and the parents please.
12/12/23, 7:20 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Thank you
13/12/23, 10:38 am - Harmehak: Good Morning Tatenda, Hope you are doing well.

I believe you must have discussed all the above mentioned points with your family?

I am here to address any questions if they have any.

Are we good to proceed with your application now?
13/12/23, 12:13 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes
13/12/23, 12:14 pm - +263 77 194 8060: I'm doing well how about you
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: I am doing well please
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - +263 77 194 8060: That's great
13/12/23, 12:16 pm - Harmehak: So Tatenda, may I know what all did you happen to discuss with your family members and what all would they like to ask from the entire process?
13/12/23, 12:20 pm - +263 77 194 8060: I spoke with my family about Edoofa, and they were interested in learning more about the program. They asked about the application process, the timeline for applying, and whether there are any scholarships or financial aid available. I told them that I'm still in the process of researching the program and that I'll have more information soon.
13/12/23, 12:22 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Do they have any questions for me currently?
13/12/23, 12:25 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Not exactly but we just want to know the exact overall figure of payment we have to pay first including the transport and admission till the end of the application so that we'll be part of the edoofa program
13/12/23, 12:27 pm - Harmehak: If you understand the concept of international education finances that play a major role are not visa fees and flight tickets. The flight ticket is required a very limited number of times as the students don't travel that often. I don't mean to say that students can not go back to their country, they can definitely go back to enjoy the holidays. What I have personally seen is, the students do not travel that often.

So, considering the main finance which plays the most important role in international education is the annual fees. So, to reduce this annual fee, Edoofa helps a student with the Earn While You Learn Program. This program provides the students with an opportunity to earn scholarship credits which in return help them to make their education more affordable.
Visa fees and flight tickets are to be bought just a month before they plan to come to India. So, let's say the student wants to come to India in August 2025, This means that his family has to cater the Visa fee and the ticket in July 2025. If you understand the concept properly, till July 2025, the student will be working in the Earn While You Learn program and will be earning Scholarship credits. Now, with this opportunity, you can save a lot of money on the annual fee which in return helps you to make your flight ticket and the Visa fee affordable.

As mentioned to you already, the scholarship covers the tuition fees as you see, the Edoofa scholarship is basically the scholarship seats acquired from the universities for their good work in the past 14 years in the higher education space. So the travel costs will have to be covered by the student, But our admission team assist you in all the steps. So that you get the cheapest air travel tickets and also easily acquire the visa. The air ticket ranges between $350-$450 But you need not worry about that yet as you will be coming to India in the month of July-August 2025 as per your preparations.
13/12/23, 12:30 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky I understand Ms , so what I'm supposed to pay now is the admission fee only
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, that too in installments after being found eligible.
13/12/23, 12:35 pm - Harmehak: You would be assisted with a thorough financial plan and you would also start with your Earn While You Learn Journey now from Zimbabwe itself.
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
13/12/23, 12:36 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
13/12/23, 12:37 pm - Harmehak: Anything else that you would like to ask please?

13/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: What exactly are you referring to please, Tatenda?
13/12/23, 12:40 pm - +263 77 194 8060: I mean you once said that my tuition fee will cover accommodation , food  and leaning necessities
13/12/23, 12:41 pm - Harmehak: Basic University Expenses is what you are referring to, Tatenda?
13/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes what do that include
13/12/23, 12:42 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Does
13/12/23, 12:44 pm - Harmehak: *Cost of education*
The cost of education includes Tuition fee, Accommodation, Food, Wifi, Laundry, Library, Gym fee, etc!

13/12/23, 12:47 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky

13/12/23, 1:02 pm - Harmehak: I would be guiding you for the same today.
13/12/23, 1:03 pm - Harmehak: Have you and your parents already had the opportunity to connect with Mrs. Ruth? You see, her story is truly remarkable. As a single parent, juggling the responsibilities of a small-scale farmer and the mother of two daughters, she has persevered. Her journey with Edoofa is a testament to how dedicated individuals can overcome obstacles.
Mrs. Ruth's experience with Edoofa is a testament to the transformative impact our programs can have. She not only managed her family's needs but also seized the opportunity for her daughters to achieve higher education. The support and guidance she received from Edoofa were instrumental in her success.
The process was challenging, yet incredibly rewarding. Mrs. Ruth's determination, combined with Edoofa's assistance, has paved the way for a brighter future .
13/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes
13/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Hue Ms Harmehak

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

*Questions 1-5 are based on the following passage.*
A fact that draws our attention is that, according to his position in life, an extravagant man is either admired or loathed. A successful business man does nothing to increase his popularity by being prudent with his money. A person who is wealthy is expected to lead a luxurious life and to be lavish with his hospitality. If he is not so, he is considered mean, and his reputation in business may even suffer in consequence. The paradox remains that he had not been careful with his money in the first place; he would never have achieved his present wealth.
Among the low income group, a different set of values exists. The young clerk, who makes his wife a present of a new dress when he has not paid his house rent, is condemned as extravagant. Carefulness with money to the point of meanness is applauded as a virtue. Nothing in his life is considered more worthy than paying his bills. The ideal wife for such a man separates her housekeeping money into joyless little piles – so much for rent, for food, for the children’s shoes, she is able to face the milkman with equanimity every, month satisfied with her economizing ways , and never knows the guilt of buying something she can’t really afford .
As for myself, I fall neither of these categories. If I have money to spare I can be extravagant, but when, as is usually the case, I am hard up and then I am the meanest man imaginable.

1. Which of the following would be the most appropriate title for the passage
a)The cause of poverty is extravagance.
b)Stingy habits of the poor.
c)Being extravagant is always condemnable.
d)Extravagance is a part of the rich as well as of the poor.

2.According to the passage the person, who is a successful businessman and wealthy
a)Is more popular if he appears to be wasting away his time.
b)Is expected to have lavish lifestyle.
c)Must be extravagant before achieving success.
d)Should not bother about popularity.

3. The phrase ‘lavish with his hospitality’ in the third sentence of the first paragraph means
a)Extravagance in entertaining guest.
b)Unconcerned in treating his friends and relatives.
c)Thoughtful in spending only on guests and strangers.
d)Stinginess in dealing with his relatives.

4.The word ‘paradox’ in the last sentence of the first paragraph means
a)A word that brings out the hidden meaning
b)Statement based on facts
c)a statement that seems self-contradictory but in reality expresses a possible truth.
d)Statement based on the popular opinion

5.What is the meaning of the word “equanimity”?
a)Calmness
b)Discomposure
c)Equivocal
d)Dubious

Whey to Go Greek yogurt—a strained form of cultured yogurt—has grown enormously in popularity in the United States since it was first introduced in the country in the late 1980s. From 2011 to 2012 alone, sales of Greek yogurt in the US increased by 50 percent. The resulting increase in Greek yogurt production has forced those involved in the business to address the detrimental effects that the yogurt-making process may be having on the environment. Fortunately, farmers and others in the Greek yogurt business have found many methods of controlling and eliminating most environmental threats. Given these solutions as well as the many health benefits of the food, the advantages of Greek yogurt Q5. outdo the potential drawbacks of its production.Sentence [1] The main environmental problem caused by the production of Greek yogurt is the creation of acid whey as a by-product.Sentence [2] Because it requires up to four times more milk to make than conventional yogurt does, Greek yogurt produces larger amounts of acid whey, which is difficult to dispose of.Sentence [3] To address the problem of disposal, farmers have found a number of uses for acid whey. Sentence[4] They can add it to livestock feed as a protein Q.6. supplement, and people can make their own Greek-style yogurt at home by straining regular yogurt.Sentence[5] If it is improperly introduced into the environment, acid-whey runoff Q.7. can pollute waterways, depleting the oxygen content of streams and rivers as it decomposes. Sentence [6] Yogurt manufacturers, food Q.8. scientists; and government officials are also working together to develop additional solutions for reusing whey.

IS IT TRUE THAT MANY AFRICANS HAVE POOR DIETS BECAUSE  THEIR FARMS ARE STAGNANT AND INEFFICIENT.

It is not a secret that many people in  Africa struggle with poor diets, but the reasons behind this problem are often misunderstood. One major factor is the stagnation and inefficiency of the region's farming industry. Many farms are small and lack access to modern technology and equipment, leading to low productivity and poor nutrition. In this essay, we'll explore the ways in which Africa's farming industry is holding the region back, and how this contributes to poor diets.

Many farms in Africa still rely on traditional methods of farming, such as hand-tilling the soil and using simple tools like hoes and machetes. This is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that leads to low productivity and poor yields. In addition, farmers often lack access to modern equipment like tractors, irrigation systems, and crop-dusting planes, which could help them increase their productivity and improve their yields.

In many parts of Africa, farmers lack access to reliable sources of water for irrigation. This means that they are at the mercy of the weather, and a bad rainy season can mean a poor harvest. In addition, even when there is enough rain, it can be hard for farmers to get the water to their crops due to a lack of infrastructure like canals and pipes. This makes it difficult for farmers to grow the crops they need to feed their families and make a living.

One of the biggest challenges facing farmers in Africa is the lack of access to high-quality seeds and fertilizer. Many farmers are stuck using old, low-yielding varieties of crops that are not well adapted to the local environment. In addition, they often cannot afford the high cost of modern seeds and fertilizer, or they don't have access to the right information on how to use them properly. This makes it hard for farmers to improve their yields and ensure a reliable source of food for them.

Many farmers in Africa struggle to get the credit they need to invest in their farms and improve their yields. Banks often require collateral, which many farmers don't have, and interest rates can be prohibitively high. In addition, the informal credit system that many farmers rely on can be exploitative and unfair. As a result, farmers are often trapped in a cycle of poverty and debt, which prevents them from investing in their farms and breaking out of the poverty trap.

Many farmers in Africa lack secure land tenure, meaning they don't have clear legal rights to the land they farm. This makes it hard for them to invest in their farms, as they may not be sure they will be able to keep the land in the future. In addition, poor land tenure can lead to conflicts with neighbors, as well as vulnerability to exploitation by powerful landlords. This insecurity prevents many farmers from achieving a stable income and improving their standard of living.

In addition to the factors already mentioned, there are several other factors that contribute to the poor diets of many people in  Africa. These include inadequate infrastructure, lack of knowledge about nutrition, and cultural factors like traditional gender roles. For example, in some cultures, women are responsible for feeding the family, but they may not have the resources or knowledge to provide a healthy and balanced diet. This can have serious consequences for the health and well-being of the entire family.

In summary, the poor diets of many people in sub-Saharan Africa are caused by a variety of complex factors, including stagnant and inefficient farming practices, lack of access to credit and loans, poor land tenure, inadequate infrastructure, lack of knowledge about nutrition, and traditional gender roles. These issues must be addressed if we are to improve the lives of farmers and their families. There is a need for increased investment in agriculture, improved access to credit and loans, and better land tenure systems.

MY INSPIRATIONAL STORY

There is perhaps no greater challenge than the loss of a loved one. Whether it be a parent, a sibling, a friend, or a partner, the grief and pain of losing someone close to us can be overwhelming. It can feel like our world has been turned upside down, and we may not know how to move forward. However, even in the darkest of times, I found it  possible to find strength, comfort, and hope after the death of my father. My own experience with the loss of a loved one taught me valuable lessons about life and helped me to find meaning in the midst of tragedy.

After losing my father , i felt isolated and alone. Friends and family may not know how to help, or they may avoid mentioning the loss for fear of upsetting me. This  led me to the feelings of loneliness and isolation. However I realized that it was  important to reach out to others, even if it's difficult, and to find ways to connect with others who have experienced a similar loss. Unfortunately i found a friend who was an orphan.There is strength in knowing that others understand and care. 

It was hard for me  to imagine what life will look like after the loss of my father.  I felt  like my future is uncertain and that i don't know what to do next. I  also feit like my sense of purpose or meaning in life has been lost, but later realized that important to take time to grieve and to allow myself to heal. Over time, you i find a new sense of purpose and meaning, and a new direction for your life.This is because I had guardians who are always there for and they took care of all things in my life.


After my father has died, it was natural for me to worry that you will forget them and the memories you shared. But l do realize that it was  important to remember that forgetting is a normal part of the grieving process, and it doesn't mean that I  loved him any less. I can honor his meory by telling stories about him, keeping hismemory alive through photographs and mementos, and living your life in a way that would make him proud. 

Grief is a natural and normal part of life, and it can be a difficult and confusing experience. The challenges and changes that come with losing a loved one can be overwhelming, but it is possible to find strength and resilience through the support of others and by focusing on the good memories and positive aspects of the person who has died. By facing the challenges of grief head-on, I found out  a way to honor my loved father's  memory and move forward with my own life. So, this is indeed my inspirational story when I faced many challenges but I found a way to overcame them and move on with my life.

16/12/23, 6:27 am - +263 71 278 9155: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 9:38 am - +263 77 194 8060: Hello Ms Harmehak
16/12/23, 10:10 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
16/12/23, 10:16 am - +263 71 278 9155: yes mam we can
16/12/23, 10:28 am - Harmehak: I thoroughly appreciate you acknowledging your support for Tatenda.
16/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
16/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
16/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
16/12/23, 10:29 am - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
16/12/23, 10:30 am - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 23rd or 24 th December 2023 for $200 and the  23rd or 24th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 23rd or 24th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
16/12/23, 12:53 pm - Harmehak: I await your response please.
18/12/23, 10:05 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
18/12/23, 10:06 am - Harmehak: @263775348668 @263771948060 @263712789155
18/12/23, 10:40 am - +263 77 194 8060: Hello Ms Harmehak
We're still figuring if we could meet your demands right now we have a lot of challenges  like to pay the school fees and the registration fee for the A level examinations and also stationary needed for next year .

We will be glad if you change the timeline so that we can pay after clearing the above fees
18/12/23, 10:46 am - Harmehak: I can understand,

Let me discuss with the Academic Board and get back to you!
18/12/23, 11:49 am - Harmehak: Sure please
18/12/23, 12:04 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky ,, anyways we'll be waiting for feedback from the academic board
18/12/23, 12:38 pm - Harmehak: Yes please Tatenda.

I have shared a request
18/12/23, 4:06 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Oky
18/12/23, 7:15 pm - Harmehak: I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*.

I wish you all a blessed evening ahead
19/12/23, 9:30 am - +263 77 194 8060: Hello Ms Harmehak
19/12/23, 6:43 pm - Harmehak: Good Evening Tatenda

How are you doing today?

Excuse me for the delay due to technical challenges.
20/12/23, 9:04 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
20/12/23, 4:57 pm - +263 77 194 8060: Yes mam ,,,how are you doing
20/12/23, 5:50 pm - Harmehak: I did discuss about Tatenda's application and your challenges with the Academic Board, but you see as per the acting policies and standards the Academic Board is not viable to change the 7 day deadline period. However, the Academic Board has mentioned that they are willing to consider Tatenda's Application, if the family faces a challenge in completing the required $200 within the stipulated timeline. As a remedial you can complete a part fee of $100 within the first 7 days, then $100 by next 21 days and finally the remaining $150 would be completed in next 30 days. All in all for $350 you will have time of 58 days.

Looking at the current situation, I feel this would be convenient to you and your family, isn't it?
20/12/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: The discussion for tomorrow is scheduled at 9 AM CAT.
