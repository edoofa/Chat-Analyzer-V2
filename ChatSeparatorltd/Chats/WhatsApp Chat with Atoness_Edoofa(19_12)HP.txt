19/12/23, 4:20 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay 

I understand that there is high competition indeed.
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
19/12/23, 4:23 pm - Harmehak: I feel you too are looking for something like this, so that just like these students you can cater for your higher education by your own self and help your parents reduce their financial burden, isn't it?
19/12/23, 4:28 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes 
It is
19/12/23, 4:31 pm - Harmehak: *Alright so Atoness, now to help you in becoming a part of our dynamic student community, let's start with your introduction.*

I would like to know you better as a student so please go ahead, tell me a bit about yourself, your education, how much USD Dalpark Learning charges you every term, along with what do you wish to study, your strengths and weaknesses, and your hobbies, since I honestly don't know a lot about you?

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*

20/12/23, 12:17 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Thank you.
20/12/23, 12:23 pm - Harmehak: Well Atoness now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
20/12/23, 12:27 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I do believe so .
Growing up I had always wanted to study abroad, and if I can have an opportunity to do so , 
I will seize the opportunity indeed.

Since I'm still young, traveling and studying in different countries becomes  a pleasure, leaning more skills , languages, diversity of human nature and an explicit experience
20/12/23, 12:49 pm - Harmehak: Well that's wonderful, 

So would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too?
20/12/23, 12:52 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Of course I am.
20/12/23, 1:11 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

20/12/23, 2:14 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, may I know more about your siblings and their current education please?
20/12/23, 2:19 pm - +27 64 981 6126: My older sister is 21a.nd currently doing a course.
My 2 little sisters are in primary level, going for grade 6 and the other one is going for grade 7.
My little brother is also in primary and going for grade 2.
20/12/23, 2:53 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

It's a pleasure to know about them all.
20/12/23, 2:54 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, may I have a better understanding to who would be the one supporting you financially and what profession they are in?
20/12/23, 3:05 pm - +27 64 981 6126: My father will be supporting me financially and he works under the metallic industry
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:10 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
20/12/23, 3:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Unfortunately,
I'm a student in South Africa and I was doing matric.

So  what levels do you consider for one to get a scholarship .
20/12/23, 3:57 pm - Harmehak: I do understand please,

Similarly for Grade 12, you must have passes in 4 major subjects, Atoness.
20/12/23, 3:58 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay , I understand, I'm confident about that
20/12/23, 4:15 pm - Harmehak: That's wonderful
20/12/23, 4:16 pm - Harmehak: Atoness, may I please have the list of subjects you appeared for in this term?
20/12/23, 4:50 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Mathematics
Physical sciences
Geography
Life Sciences
English Home Language
Zulu first add language
Life Orientation
Tourism
20/12/23, 4:54 pm - Harmehak: Received, Atoness,

Does your Life sciences and Physical sciences include all three of Biology, Chemistry and Physics?
20/12/23, 5:58 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Yes yes
It does
20/12/23, 5:59 pm - Harmehak: Duly noted.
20/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: What motivates you to study Medicine , Atoness?
20/12/23, 6:12 pm - +27 64 981 6126: It's a dream , looking deep into the medical industry is makes one to find out more things about human health, I wanna discover the causes of certain disease and have more understanding about the human body .
Saving people's lives is one of the main thingd
20/12/23, 6:19 pm - Harmehak: I completely understand what you are sharing and equally appreciate your desire to help other, Atoness.
20/12/23, 6:25 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I'm glad to hear that 😊
20/12/23, 6:27 pm - Harmehak: So Atoness, what all did you research regarding medicine?

Along with the same what did you research regarding medicine in India and its requirements?
20/12/23, 6:34 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I know that medicine requires one to have high marks especially in science subjects, a lot of students tend to drop medicine because it is a bit challenging.
20/12/23, 6:39 pm - Harmehak: I can understand what you are sharing and that is quite true as well!

And what did you research regarding the requirements to pursue medicine in India?
20/12/23, 6:53 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Academic qualifications: To secure MBBS admission in India, candidates must have passed class 12 from a recognised board. Subjects studied: To pursue an MBBS course, students should have studied Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in their class 11 and 12.
One must be 18-25 yrs
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: I understand!
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: As you mentioned that it is your desire to study medicine, but it is very unfortunate that we don't offer medicine as a course because of the following reasons:

*1. Affordability:* Medicine is one of the most expensive course everywhere in the world, as it requires high-class facilities and great doctors and mentors to teach that.

*2. Eligibility:* As you would have seen from the video, that India is a great place to study for higher education as it has both qualities of education and affordability, but for medicine in India, you need to give an entrance exam named NEEt, which is very competitive and only 1000 students are selected from millions each year .

*3. Length of the program:* Medicine is 6-8years course including the internships that are mandatory, so it also contributes to the affordability issue
20/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: But I realize that you want to do a course that makes your parent proud and also align with your passion. So you can go ahead with the courses like

*1. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology*
*2. Bachelors in  Pharmacy*
*3. Bachelors in Physiotherapy*
*4. Bachelors in Optometry*
*5. Bachelors of Science in Medical Lab Technology* 

These courses have lesser duration than Medicine and are more affordable for students.
20/12/23, 7:59 pm - Harmehak: I would have loved to continue, however I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 9 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
20/12/23, 8:10 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay maybe Bachelor in Medical Lab Technology will do cause chemicals are my favourite
20/12/23, 8:11 pm - Harmehak: That's great, shall I brief you about the same before our discussion tomorrow?
20/12/23, 8:11 pm - +27 64 981 6126: Okay sure
20/12/23, 8:11 pm - +27 64 981 6126: I will
