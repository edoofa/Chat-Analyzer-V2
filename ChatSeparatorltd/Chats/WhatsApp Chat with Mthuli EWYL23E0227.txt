I wanted to inform you that we won't be able to connect for our session today, as we are celebrating our *77th Independence Day.* 🇮🇳

On this day, _India gained freedom from British colonial rule after nearly 200 years of struggle._ The celebrations are a reminder of the courage and determination of our ancestors, who worked tirelessly to secure our nation's sovereignty.🌟
15/08/23, 8:34 am - +263 78 427 4645: Okay mentor
15/08/23, 8:53 am - +263 78 427 4645: That is great. So India and Zimbabwe have similar history. Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980 after a long struggle against the British. Yesterday we celebrated our heroes day to remember those who sacrificed their lives for our independence. Today we are celebrating Defence Forces Day, a day for our defence forces who are working tirelessly to defend our sovereignty.

Lately, I've noticed that some of you haven't been consistently following your EWYL ritual on the EWYL line. I want to stress that this small gesture plays a significant role in maintaining your attendance records and ensuring you receive the full benefits of our program.

So, if not done, go and say "I am a proud Edoofian" on your Line. It's not just a phrase; it's a symbol of your commitment to your education and our collective journey.

It's been a while since we last had a conversation. I wanted to take this moment to share my happiness with you about the _*upcoming grand festival, Diwali, on November 12, 2023,*_ 🪔

Much like Christmas for us, it's a time when everyone eagerly anticipates reuniting with family. Diwali symbolizes the triumph of good over evil through the radiance of lights🕯️

*During this time, we all look forward to celebrating Diwali with our family, so I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday, November 14, 2023*.

Wishing you a joyous Diwali filled with light and prosperity. 
Have a splendid day ahead!

22/11/23, 10:02 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning @263784274645 @263777615536 @263775703782 

I sincerely hope you're well. It's been a while since we last connected, and as I see many of my students eagerly resuming their EWYL journey after completing their exams, it brings back memories of your passion and enthusiasm when you started yours.

I can't help but wonder why we've lost touch. Your dedication to your goals was inspiring, and your journey holds a special place in my heart. As your mentor, I'm genuinely concerned about your well-being and progress. Please, if there's anything on your mind, don't hesitate to share. I'm here to support you in any way I can.
22/11/23, 10:03 am - +263 78 427 4645: Good morning mentor, its been a while since we have been in touch.
22/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 427 4645: I am sorry mentor but unfortunately have not yet finished writing my exams
22/11/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 427 4645: I will write my last paper on the 28th of November
22/11/23, 10:57 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, Mthuli. I want you to connect with me on the 28th of November to resume your EWYL journey. Is that alright?
20/12/23, 1:29 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,Mthuli!

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?

Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.

As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
20/12/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 570 3782: Good afternoon, its been a longtime. Mthuli's device is currently having some problems however we will make sure that it's sorted out without delay. I hope that from tomorrow everything will be fine.
20/12/23, 4:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, I really hope to connect with him tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. on the EWYL Line. +91 98107 89170
20/12/23, 5:53 pm - +263 77 761 5536: Thank you, very much
