I am 17 years old currently preparing for  upper six in 2024 at Lady Enarater International high school which is located in Mashonaland Central, Zimbabwe.Lady Enarater high school is a reliable International private school which is paid USD 1300 per term. I am doing science subjects which are  maths,chemistry and biology because I believe that I am going to be a successful neurosurgeon in the next few years to come ,why? because i know there are lot of people out there who have debilitating conditions in our country and there are a few neurosurgeon who can help them so I believe I will be at help too if I was to add the number of neurosurgeon in our country and would gladly would be at help if i am to become International too. 
For my strengths ,my leadership skills are quite breathe taking says spectators' feedback because currently am a leader at Lady Enarater International high school, teamwork too,problem solving and communication too can count as I am seeing myself being a therapist and a neurosurgeon too.
As for my weaknesses ,one of them is being a highly sensitive person as I sometimes consider other people 's emotions rather than mine.
i am into music and reading a lot of books during my free time.
As I mentioned above ,I am the first born child in a family of two children, where the last born is a 11 year old boy at primary level right now preparing for his final year at primary level.My father and mother have been financially supporting my education ever since I stepped my way in kindergarten and they will  continue to do so until I'm in my graduation gown,but I also have plans in supporting them too as time goes by.My father is a pharmacy sales representative and my mother is a hair dresser who  Try their best everyday for our wellbeing.

Thank you
15/12/23, 9:27 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
15/12/23, 10:50 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yes we may start
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Thank you for sharing such a detailed and inspiring introduction. It's evident that you have a clear vision for your future and are dedicated to pursuing a career as a neurosurgeon. Your commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others in Zimbabwe is commendable.
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Your strengths, particularly in leadership, teamwork, problem-solving, and communication, are essential attributes for a successful career in medicine. It's great to see that you are already demonstrating these skills in your current role as a leader at Lady Enarater International high school.
15/12/23, 11:18 am - Tushti: Given your family background and the financial support from your parents, it's wonderful that you have plans to support them in return. Your father's role as a pharmacy sales representative and your mother's work as a hairdresser showcase the value of hard work and dedication within your family.
15/12/23, 11:19 am - Tushti: Now, to move further, I would like to know whether you have done any research about the subject requirement to becoem a nuerosurgeon in international universities?
15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Thank you
15/12/23, 11:36 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss 
I am working on that
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: Munashe, if you would have researched you would have found out that since Medical Education and Engineering Education are two aspects for which Indian Education System is known for, because of that both these courses and their requirements are set up directly by the Indian Government itself. Therefore if a student has to study any Healthcare course in India then they should have 3 Mandatory subjects in their A Level which are *Physics, Chemistry, and Biology*. whereas if they want to study any Engineering Course then they should have *Physics and Maths* in their A level mandatorily.
15/12/23, 11:49 am - Tushti: You see majority of the time students study subjects as per their country's requirements, therefore, the only courses left that these students could pursue ahead which would also align with the healthcare sector are 

1. Bachelor of Science in Nutrition and Dietetics

2. Bachelor of Science in Microbiology

3. Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology

4. Bachelor of Science in Cardiovascular Technology

5. Bachelor of science in Physiotherapy

6. Bachelor of science in Optometry

7. Bachelor of science in Biochemistry

8. Bachelor of Science in Biotechnology
15/12/23, 11:53 am - +263 78 749 4463: So for my situation mathematics is not necessary??
15/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 749 4463: Because unfortunately for my case ,physics is not involved in the picture
15/12/23, 11:55 am - +263 78 749 4463: So is it possible for me to do Medicine without physics
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: It is not possible, dear
15/12/23, 11:56 am - Tushti: These are the courses that must now choose from
15/12/23, 11:57 am - +263 78 749 4463: Which are the 8 you listed above?
15/12/23, 12:12 pm - Tushti: Yes
16/12/23, 9:20 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
16/12/23, 9:27 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yess we may
16/12/23, 9:59 am - Tushti: So, have you chosen the course you wish to pursue?
16/12/23, 10:05 am - +263 78 749 4463: Bachelor of Science in Medical Laboratory Technology
16/12/23, 10:31 am - Tushti: What is reason for choosing this course?
16/12/23, 10:39 am - +263 78 749 4463: Well if I can't be a neurosurgeon it's okay 
Because it's already too late for me right to divert my subjects right now
But my goal too is to study and work in medicine 
So If not being a neurosurgeon why not be in medical laboratory technology 
Besides I'm really good in chemistry and biology 
So why not divert the broken dreams to something that may be to great help 
You never know unless you give it a try
16/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Very well!
16/12/23, 10:44 am - Tushti: Let me brief you about the course
16/12/23, 10:45 am - +263 78 749 4463: Okay
16/12/23, 10:45 am - Tushti: A *B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology* is a 3-year undergraduate program that focuses on the skills and knowledge required to work in the field of clinical laboratory science. Medical laboratory technologists play a crucial role in the healthcare system by conducting various laboratory tests and analyses that assist in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases.

During the program, students are trained in various laboratory techniques, sample collection, testing procedures, and result interpretation. They learn how to handle and analyze different types of biological samples, such as blood, urine, tissue, and body fluids. *The curriculum also includes theoretical and practical courses in subjects like microbiology, biochemistry, hematology, immunology, and pathology.*

*Upon completion of the program, graduates can pursue careers as Laboratory Technicians, Laboratory Managers, Medical Officers, Research Associates, Medical Record Technicians, Resident Medical Officers, Lab Assistants, Laboratory Testing Managers, or even pursue teaching positions as Associate Professors or Lecturers in the field of medical laboratory science.*

Job opportunities for medical laboratory technologists can be found in a variety of settings, including hospitals, healthcare clinics, medical pathology laboratories, research laboratories, urologists' offices, and other healthcare facilities. They work closely with healthcare professionals, such as doctors and pathologists, to provide accurate and timely laboratory test results that contribute to patient care and treatment decisions.

*Overall, a B.Sc. in Medical Laboratory Technology provides graduates with the skills and knowledge necessary to perform laboratory tests, contribute to medical research, and make a valuable impact in the field of healthcare.*
16/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 749 4463: Oooh okay 
Thank you for the brief.definiton
16/12/23, 10:48 am - +263 78 749 4463: Sorry to ask a lot of questions 
So anyway anyhow 
I can't be a doctor?
In anyway?
16/12/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: With the subject combination you have, that is not possible
16/12/23, 11:22 am - Tushti: So, do you wish to proceed with this course?
16/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 749 4463: Okay
16/12/23, 11:29 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss
16/12/23, 11:32 am - Tushti: Since you have understood the course properly can you now tell me in 80 to 100 words that if you are provided with this career option how do you see yourself 5 years after the completion of this course and if you get into Edoofa’s Program, how can it enable you to achieve your dreams?
16/12/23, 12:31 pm - +263 78 749 4463: Okay thank you for this opportunity 
Firstly it would be a great honour if Edoofa's program was to offer me this opportunity in life to achieve my dreams as a young girl with a huge vision. My goal is to have further education overseas to gain great knowledge with dedication to wear what they call graduation gown with  either my degree or PHD in my hands hoping to have a high paying job as the future draws by as it might be impossible in our country due to circumstances.From my research,India is one of the best countries with high facilities in education especially when it comes to medical programs so I was like why not then.So it would be a dream come true as I see myself in 5 years time being one of the best medical laboratory technicians world wide and may be  effective in diagnosis and treatment of patients in my country too with great research and tests .And yes I see myself as one of the successful women in medicine too wide world because I know I have a vision and I am gonna achieve it .
16/12/23, 1:11 pm - Tushti: That is really great Munashe, I admire your foresightedness and your aspirations,

However, as a counselor let me share with you from my personal experience that the career path which you have chosen, requires a lot of hard work and dedication.

Are you willing to give your 200% hard work and take all the opportunities that come your way in order to transform your career dear?
16/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 749 4463: 😂😂a lot of hard work woowww
16/12/23, 1:52 pm - +263 78 749 4463: As your counselor right 
What would your take be in my path
16/12/23, 4:37 pm - Tushti: As it's the weekend, Now we will connect on *Monday at 9:30 am* Please be online during your session time!

18/12/23, 9:33 am - Tushti: Hello , Good Morning, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
18/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 749 4463: This message was deleted
18/12/23, 9:34 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yes we may
18/12/23, 9:48 am - Tushti: So, are you saying that you would not be willing to work hard? This scholarship is only awarded to meritorious determined students
18/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 749 4463: Nooo I will work extra hard I promise 
It's just that from my current   pressure in A level now 
I Will have to add more when I'm in university 
Which came to my thought that to achieve whatever I want to achieve there are hard stages which I have to go through like the extra working when I'm doing my course now
18/12/23, 10:01 am - +263 78 749 4463: So yesss  I am saying I Will work harder
18/12/23, 10:21 am - Tushti: I am glad to see that you are willing to work hard for your career, however, can you please tell me why you want to study abroad and not in your country?
18/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 749 4463: Well in our country there are low teaching skills compared to abroad ,why? Our country has limited access to specific knowledge and educational facilities needed.
At least studying abroad I may have the facilities that may be great help in my study path.
And yess studying abroad will help me to approach different situations in different areas which they may call exposure and that's what I need to improve my career prospects.
18/12/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: I completely undersyand
18/12/23, 10:50 am - Tushti: So now as you know Edoofa Recommends India as a Higher Education destination

May I know what is your knowledge or what have you researched about India and Indian Education System which makes you feel that studying in India would help you achieve your dreams?
18/12/23, 11:07 am - +263 78 749 4463: Well approximately 90000 of students graduates are produced each year around India with higher job ranks which inspired me and innovated me to strike because that is definitely light to my career pathway
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: Moving further now if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
18/12/23, 1:13 pm - Tushti: My experience says *consistency* is key to success in Edoofa's Earn While You Learn Program. By attending sessions regularly and seeking guidance from mentors, students can not just build their skill set but earn a higher amount of scholarship credits as well. *Our star performers, or Proud Edoodians, have earned up to $3000* in just one year by constantly asking for more projects and assignments to improve their performance. With Edoofa's financial aid, students can self-sponsor their higher education.

*I hope you can now realize how we are different isn’t it something that you have been looking for regarding your international education?*

19/12/23, 11:46 am - Tushti: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

*1. Projects with Brands and Companies: -*

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders, the following are:

-_*Africa Global Radio*_ - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following link to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4DAP24ZuY4&authuser=0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kqk47qcue0E&authuser=0

-_*Skooqs*_ - This is an Edtech company that provides courses in the field of AI and Robotics, and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

*2. Recruitment Partners: -*

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics

*3. Webinars: -*

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field.Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -
_Digitalization of Industries: How to become an all-rounder in the ever-changing professional world_ by *Mr. Tosin Olaiton Oyelade*.
_How to network like a boss_ by *Ms. Oluwaseun (Gabby) Owolabi*
_How to be industry ready before graduating? Hear it from an employer!_ by *Ms. Yasmin Bitugu*

19/12/23, 11:47 am - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 11:47 am - Tushti: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase. 

*What are your views on the same? Do you think this will benefit you?*
19/12/23, 11:47 am - Tushti: Noted
19/12/23, 11:49 am - +263 78 749 4463: I really think it would benefit me
19/12/23, 11:50 am - Tushti: Alright now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you and your parent would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes.
19/12/23, 11:50 am - Tushti: Munashe, as per my experience, whenever a student plans to study abroad, for the application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship. 

*Considering the cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 78 749 4463: 1500-2250
19/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: Exactly Munashe, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.

19/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: *But, as we know the COVID-19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 11:52 am - Tushti: Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check. *The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating a statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 11:52 am - +263 77 284 4437: I'm sorry  I ws busy a little  but,that's is great
19/12/23, 11:54 am - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss okay I'm getting you
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: Since you have understood how Edoofa has made the application process simpler and affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: Munashe, basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

*Phase 1:* Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

*Phase 2:* Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

*Phase 3:* Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.*
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.
19/12/23, 12:05 pm - Tushti: Do you or your parent have any questions so far?
19/12/23, 12:08 pm - +263 77 284 4437: Noo question  at the moment
19/12/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: Meanwhile, let me brief you how the process follow after you are found eligible and enroll in the Program which is the Step 4 of Edoofa Cycle.
19/12/23, 12:10 pm - Tushti: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Alright Munashe, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in Zimbabwe itself. <This message was edited>
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: Step 5: After enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, The Admission Team from here onwards will be responsible for assisting you with all your admission related documents such as Statement of Purpose, Letter of Recommendations, etc. Now since financial planning is something which is one of the most important aspects while considering international education, Edoofa's Admission Officers, help an applicant and their family members curate the most efficient financial plan after interacting and understanding their financial capabilities.
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: August 2025 intake, applicants would receive a provisional offer letter from the Edoofa's Academic Board, after which their Admission Team would financially assist them in preparing the necessary formalities of Seat Reservation in installments.
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 instalments. (The first part will be paid in August 2025 and the remaining in January 2026). Moreover, as shared above our Admissions team will be providing you flexible payment plans to pay the registration within 3 or 4 months thereby reducing the financial stress and ensuring timely planning for your higher education.
19/12/23, 12:11 pm - Tushti: With this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check, would you like to ask anything?
19/12/23, 12:40 pm - Tushti: Are we connected?
19/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 749 4463: No questions
19/12/23, 12:45 pm - +263 78 749 4463: Yesss
19/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready

2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India

3. Also, the financial aspect involved

4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: And, for any questions apart from whatever we have explained, I would appreciate it if you refer your family to the FAQ document which has all the answers to most of the queries which generally parents have. 

Furthermore, if they have any other queries I would suggest that you note down all of the questions as I would like to inform you that *tomorrow at 12 pm* I would also be connecting with you and your family in this group itself, to assist you in planning your higher education and help them with the questions and queries that they might have. *Parent participation is mandatory in this session, failure to attend would result in the cancellation of the application*
19/12/23, 12:46 pm - Tushti: Also, have a look at some pictures of the students who came to India recently for their Academic Session. I look forward to seeing your smiling face on such a picture very soon!

20/12/23, 12:08 pm - Tushti: Hello , Good afternoon, Hope you are doing well

As discussed, I am here for us to continue with your application, so shall we start?
20/12/23, 5:39 pm - Tushti: Hi, I hope you are doing well.

I can see that you aren't able to get back to me because of certain reasons which I am not aware of and since we couldn't have a proper discussion regarding your application. I would appreciate it if you share your concerns with me so that I can guide you accordingly. Please remember that the number of seats for the scholarship is very limited and the more you delay, the lesser the chances are for getting a good quantum of scholarship. 

I hope to get a positive response from you soon.
