07/08/23, 2:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
-
07/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Enlighten me pn the objectives
07/08/23, 2:05 pm - +263 77 508 9219: on🖕
07/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
07/08/23, 2:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
07/08/23, 2:07 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Got it.
07/08/23, 2:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
07/08/23, 2:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Waal this is very encouraging
07/08/23, 2:11 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I hope to so my best with your help.
07/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Undoubtedly! I hope, I will  give your examples to other students!🌟
07/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Hope so too
07/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Hallo

07/08/23, 2:50 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.

After that, you will see various websites that might have some information about various companies. Go through those companies, the company whom you think best fits the criterion of being that suitable company, and search for all the details required in the form via LINKEDIN and GOOGLE.
24/08/23, 2:40 pm - +263 77 508 9219: About the LinkedIn account. Are you going to help me create one.

Are you ready for your session?✨
25/08/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Hallo yes l am ready
25/08/23, 4:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Your session time is over now. Great!  We will reconvene on Monday since we don't have sessions on Saturday and Sunday. Have a fantastic weekend! 🌟
25/08/23, 4:05 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Ahhh was 8n town. Sorry for late response. Nice weekend too
28/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: To identify the right student (Applicant), we can get in touch with our schoolmates who are in Form 6 or the students who have passed their Form 6 (A-Level Examination).
Let's say that you have reached out to the students who are in Form 6.
Now, on average, say that there are 3 divisions in your Form 6, and assume that in each division there are 20 students. Suppose we plan to reach out to the first division of Form 6. For that, the first step would be to connect with these 20 students of Form 6 and ask them to add you to their Official/unofficial WhatsApp Group (if you are not added)
28/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once they add you there, you can share the link to YOUR WhatsApp Group (that you created in the first step) and tell them that on that group you will be sharing information about an exciting opportunity where they get a chance to pursue your education in India with a guaranteed scholarship of 50-100% on the tuition fee. To know more, please get added to the group.
28/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Once you convey this information in one of the divisions of Form 6, you can repeat the same with the other divisions of Form 6. So in this way, you will have asked and spread information about your group to a minimum of 60 students (3 divisions of form 6).
28/08/23, 2:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: 2] ADD MENTOR:

Make sure that before you start interacting with the participants in the group that you created for the community-building project, YOU ADD ME.

The purpose of doing this is that:
- I will be able to track your progress and guide you through learning the networking skill
- I will be able to see the concerns raised by students and we can discuss them accordingly.
- I will be able to see whether the right information has been shared with all the students

28/08/23, 2:37 pm - +263 77 508 9219: I am following you
28/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
28/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few.

This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉
28/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees.

28/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, After sharing the above information, Please make sure that you follow up with the student on his/her understanding of the discussion above.

20/09/23, 1:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - +263 77 508 9219: Got it
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.
FIRST- Please note your batch timings for your sessions.
Tuesday and Thursday - 9:30 am  to 11:00 am
SECOND- In our sessions, we will discuss the weekend activity or the Wednesday lesson plus the projects and the newsletter.
THIRD- All our conversations from now on will take forward in the EWYL Line.
20/09/23, 1:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The EWYL line contact number is: +91 98107 89170
Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
20/09/23, 1:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

 'Greetings, Ms. Ananya, I am <NAME> and I am here to resume my EWYL discussion. My EWYL group name is .....'

31/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Tinotenda!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 6:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as you prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

07/11/23, 6:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Greetings, Tinotenda and parents,*

I hope this message finds you well amidst the ongoing examinations. I'm excited to share some fantastic news with you regarding the recent orientation held at Edoofa's partner colleges.

In these orientation programs, the primary aim was to bridge the gap between students and mentors. It provided the valuable opportunity for each student to meet their respective mentor, a crucial connection that will guide them throughout their EWYL and overall Edoofa's journey.

The session delved deep into the Earn While You Learn program, a path to financial independence while pursuing your education. We discussed strategies to maximize scholarship credits, ensuring our students make the most of this opportunity.

07/11/23, 6:08 pm - Ananya Edoofa: But it wasn't all about it. We also had a fun chit-chat session, breaking the ice and building a sense of community.

Now, here's a question for both students and parents to ponder: What, in your opinion, are the key factors that will help you succeed in your Earn While You Learn journey? We'd love to hear your thoughts!

Keep up the good work with your exams, and remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Together, we'll make this journey an incredible success.

Hope you are doing well.

Our Edoofians in India lit up Diwali, the Festival of Lights, with unmatched enthusiasm. From radiant diyas to vibrant rangoli, their classrooms and homes sparkled with festive joy🪔. Embracing cultural diversity, students and teachers adorned themselves in traditional attire, fostering a sense of unity. The spirit of giving shone through charity initiatives, and the night sky dazzled with spectacular fireworks💥. This Diwali celebration wasn't just a festival; it was a vibrant tapestry of tradition, unity, and joy, creating unforgettable memories for our Edoofian family! Have a look at it👇🏼
