I hope this message finds you well. I am *Mr. Shivjeet, Admissions Officer at Edoofa,* working alongside Mr. Milan (Senior Admission Officer), Ms. Vilsha (Head of Admissions), and Mr. Avreen (Registrar of Scholarships) at Edoofa. 

As per our commitment, following the successful closure of the 2023 intake, I am delighted to inform you that we are now fully prepared to commence the university application process for your higher studies, targeting the intake of 2024. 

Before we embark on your admission journey, I'd like to inquire about your well-being and that of your family. How have the past few months been for you and your family?
07/09/23, 2:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I understand now. Thank you for sharing the information with me in advance. I recognize that attending school might pose challenges for Takudzwa’s participation. I would like both you and Takudzwa to be kindly aware that this is a family discussion group, and our sessions can also involve only parents at times.

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed. May I know if you are facing any challenges?

08/09/23, 3:56 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's clear that Takudzwa may face some difficulties in attending school activities. I kindly request both you and Takudzwa to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, shall we further proceed with the session?
08/09/23, 3:56 pm - +263 77 239 7498: I am happy for the children

30/10/23, 5:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As you must recall, we have completed the first three steps of your admission, which include the *Message from the founders (The 4 Videos), the Statement of Purpose, and University Counseling (the registration process that we discussed)*

Now, moving on to the fourth stage, which is the offer letter, it is crucial for us to ensure a clear understanding of the registration process. Therefore, if you don't mind, could you please share your brief understanding with me?
30/10/23, 5:09 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Waiting for this message
30/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*.

30/10/23, 5:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one. May I know if we are on the same page?

30/10/23, 5:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.

30/10/23, 5:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Please inform me once you have reviewed these benefits, and we can then proceed to discuss each of them in detail, one by one.*
31/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 298 7788: I reviewed the benefits
31/10/23, 4:13 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Good afternoon
31/10/23, 4:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, 

May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session?
31/10/23, 4:19 pm - +263 71 298 7788: May we proceed tomorrow morning
31/10/23, 4:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As I will not be available tomorrow, I would like to know if you would be able to connect this Thursday at 2:00 PM for further progress in our session?
31/10/23, 4:53 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Ooh yes
31/10/23, 5:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. We shall connect at the said time frame.
02/11/23, 2:45 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon, dear Parents and Takudzwa.

I hope that you are doing well and blessed. I hope you are well and blessed.

I'm now active and ready to take on your session. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session.
02/11/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Good afternoon 
Let's proceed with our session
02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of the A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, his/her responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and the Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of evaluation, you will receive the letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete the registration formalities, you will be presented with the Official Admission Letter with the help of which you will be able to apply for the student visa.
02/11/23, 3:06 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same. 

This means, that an Edoofa student, has the prestigious privilege of securing the seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning as a frontier person in this endeavor.
02/11/23, 3:26 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Noted
02/11/23, 3:27 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Well understood
02/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
02/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
02/11/23, 3:32 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 3:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: May I know if we are still connected so that we can proceed further with the session and hopefully wrap up our session for today? @263712987788
02/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 71 298 7788: We are still connected
02/11/23, 3:57 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Well understood
02/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *3. Avail an Endowment Grant of $150 on your university registration fee due.*

I'm pleased to know that you've grasped this concept. In this context, when you receive the Letter of Intent, which is essentially the Offer Letter, from the university, it will specify the registration fee. The $150 grant comes into play here. To understand this, if your registration fee is $750, this grant effectively reduces your payable registration fee to $600.
02/11/23, 3:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, instead of the initial $750 fee, you will only be required to pay $600. Once this payment is completed, the entire $750 amount will be  adjusted against your first-year university fee. The reason behind this seamless adjustment is that Edoofa will be covering the $150 portion, directing it towards the university on your behalf, thereby completing the total as $750. Does this explanation resonate with you?
02/11/23, 4:05 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Understood
02/11/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *4. Experience financial ease with the option to split the registration fee payment into two parts over a 30-45-day period.*

I'm delighted to know that you're pleased with the information. In situations where your financial arrangements might not be immediately prepared, *Edoofa* recognizes this concern. Thus, with the Endowment Plan, we are able to offer the flexibility of splitting the payment for the Registration fee into two parts.
02/11/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Here's how it works: After the $150 grant is applied, the first part, which amounts to 50% of the registration fee, needs to be paid within the timeframe specified by the university. Subsequently, the second part, accounting for the remaining 50% of the registration fee, should be settled within 30 days from the initial deadline date.
02/11/23, 4:05 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: For instance, if your deadline is set for November 10, 2023, and your registration fee after deducting the grant stands at $600, you'll need to make a payment of $300 on or before November 10, 2023. The remaining $300 should be paid by December 10, 2023. Have you followed the details so far? Is there anything you'd like to inquire about?
02/11/23, 4:10 pm - +263 71 298 7788: I hear you
02/11/23, 4:10 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  Before we proceed to discuss the remaining three points, I'd like to inquire whether you're familiar with how your scholarship quantum would be assessed for the offer letter you are to secure, particularly considering that you don't have your A-Level results yet. Are you aware of this process, or would you like me to provide you with more information on it?
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 71 298 7788: May you kindly provide us with the information
02/11/23, 4:11 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No worries, let me help you with this. When a student reaches step four, in case they are yet to get their A Level results, the evaluation of their application is based on their previous academic records, their statement of purpose, and recommendations from Edoofa. Consequently, they are assured of provisional admission along with a minimum of 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To pursue their Bachelor's degree and maintain their scholarship, they need to attain two passes, which is basically two E grades. It's worth noting that there have been scenarios where students have failed to achieve even 6 points in their A-Levels.  In such a case, as per the scholarship norms, I am sure you agree that a student wouldn't qualify for a 50% scholarship.
02/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, let me draw your attention towards the fact that when a student reserves their scholarship seat with the university under the benefits of Endowment Program, their scholarship percentage wouldn't be reduced from the initial 50% and would remain unchanged. Hence ensuring that a student continues their scholarship opportunity despite their low academic performance in high school.
02/11/23, 4:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In case a student achieves a favorable result, the university will re-evaluate their application. Based on their assessment, they will determine the final quantum of the scholarship. I hope you are clear with this now and you can see how the Endowment Plan gives a student an edge over the other students who will do their admission process without the assistance from Edoofa?
02/11/23, 4:17 pm - +263 71 298 7788: I now have a question
02/11/23, 4:18 pm - +263 71 298 7788: At how many points do you give a student 100%?
02/11/23, 4:21 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I would like to clarify that the scholarship percentage will not be solely determined based on the results one secures on their A-level exams. It will be determined based on multiple factors, such as their previous O-level results, the quality of their statement of purpose (SOP), their scores at the time of enrollment, communication skills, and more. May I know if you are clear about this?
02/11/23, 4:23 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Understood
02/11/23, 4:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that.  I believe as a student they would be left with the below three options, do you agree with this?

*1. Reappear in A Level (Benefit Number 5)*
*2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree (Benefit Number 6)*
*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career (Benefit Number 7)*
02/11/23, 4:33 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Noted
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Let us discuss all the options and the benefits one by one starting with the first one -

*1. Reappear in A Level*

Now here if you decide to go with Option 1, which is reappearing in the A Level exams, in such a case, I believe you will need some time to sit for the reappear exams in November 2024 and once your results come in 2025, you will be able to join the August 2025 batch and pursue your bachelor's degree then.
02/11/23, 5:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because of the Endowment Plan, he/she will be given the time and resources to work hard and reappear for his/her exams, and his/her scholarship seat will still be reserved with the university for another year. I hope you are clear about this solution?
06/11/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed this hed led s to a delay in your admission process. May I know if you are facing any challenges?
06/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Good afternoon
06/11/23, 3:07 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Noted. I was waiting for benefit number 2
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Pursue a diploma course first and then continue with your bachelor's degree*

Moving forward to the second point which is pursuing a diploma course. Based on your A Level results, you won't be able to continue with your bachelor's degree in 2024, and if instead of reappearing for your exams and starting with your Bachelor's in 2025, if you wish not to take a step back, you will have the opportunity pursue a diploma course in India in the field of her interest in August 2024 itself.
06/11/23, 3:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete your diploma course in India, you will be able to continue your bachelor's education and if you want, you will be able to pursue the same in India by being a part of the Edoofa Scholarship Program. Are you clear about this?
06/11/23, 4:06 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Very clear
06/11/23, 4:09 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, let us move forward to the last point, 

*3. Give up on your education and put a stop to your academic career*

Now, let us consider that you do not wish to reappear for your exams or pursue a diploma course, in that case, basically, you would be putting an academic stop to your career. In that case, you will be guaranteed an earning in cash under the EWYL program of the amount equal to the registration fee and the enrollment fee which you have paid and along with certificates of various job-oriented projects by completing one year under the program. Your earnings/money will be transferred to your bank account.
06/11/23, 4:40 pm - +263 71 298 7788: OK
06/11/23, 4:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
06/11/23, 4:41 pm - +263 71 298 7788: Well noted
06/11/23, 4:44 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. The admissions for the academic intake of August 2024 began last month, and as a result, students have already commenced their admission procedures.

I hope you are enthusiastic about getting the process underway. Presently, 37 students have already secured their scholarship seats and have benefitted from the Endowment Program, leaving 63 positions available for this month. 

Let's embark on our efforts to ensure that you are among the fortunate individuals who not only benefit from the Edoofa scholarship program but also receive the advantages of the endowment. Are you looking forward to the next steps and receiving this offer letter?

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. I was not able to further connect with you by the time that you reached out as it was past my available hours. With that in mind, I am now active and prepared to start our session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
20/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and Takudzwa.
20/12/23, 4:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for quite some time now. This has raised some concerns on my part, which is affecting your scholarship application. As we have already mentioned before, we will be proceeding with your admission process after *August 2023*.


I understand that there might be challenges regarding this. Hence, if you're ready now, please let me know so that we can proceed with the session or let me know if you are facing any challenges so that we can discuss this better.
