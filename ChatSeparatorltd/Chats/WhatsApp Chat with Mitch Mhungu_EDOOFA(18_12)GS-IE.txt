*I am Mr Gurvinder Singh, Senior Career Counselor at Edoofa*

Please note that I have two counseling slots in a day which are during my working hours from *7:30 am to 4:30 pm CAT Monday to Friday*, so to complete your application you would have to be present during that time. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning. Therefore I would like you to be online at the above-mentioned time for a smooth conversation.

20/12/23, 4:41 pm - Gurvinder: Alright, so Mitch, I can see you got to know about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, is that correct?
20/12/23, 4:41 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes it is
20/12/23, 4:42 pm - Gurvinder: Okay, so can you tell me what did you learn about the Edoofa Program from Valerie, also do tell me whether you learnt about Valerie’s Journey and Experience with the Edoofa Program?
20/12/23, 4:52 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Honestly I haven't learnt much about the Edoofa program except that it offers scholarships , however she did mention that her journey was and still is enjoyable. India offers languages which include English
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 4:55 pm - Gurvinder: You are lucky to get an opportunity to attend this counseling session this early because of your friend Valerie who is currently studying here in India because of the Edoofa Scholarship Program.  Did your friend introduce you to the parameters of this Scholarship  as to How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 4:56 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Yes she did introduce me to the parameters.
20/12/23, 4:59 pm - Gurvinder: How much is the  Quantum of Scholarship that we offer? (Eg. 20-50%, 40-80%, 50-100% or is it 100%)
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Well she did give me an example of a 60 percent scholarship and the student has to pay 40 percent on other expenses
20/12/23, 5:03 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Along with examination fees
20/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 78 825 3372: However I would prefer a 100% scholarship.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Noted.
20/12/23, 5:08 pm - Gurvinder: Okay so Mitch, as we start your counseling session, I would like to brief you that Edoofa assures a minimum of 50% scholarship and a maximum of 100% scholarship. 



In order to get a higher quantum of scholarship an applicant has to meet the following metrics. 

*1. Proactiveness in Counseling Session* 
*2. Parent’s Participation in the Process*

 You see students who have gotten scholarships more than 80% on tuition and accommodation had one thing in common, their parents/guardians, and family members were present throughout their counseling and eligibility process. Also, they were proactive for at least a day to complete their sessions.
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - Gurvinder: Having said that, I think you will adhere to the above two quantifiers. Do you have any limitations that may hinder you and your Parents from being online for at least TWO-THREE hours today?
20/12/23, 5:09 pm - +263 78 825 3372: Noted sir
20/12/23, 5:10 pm - +263 78 825 3372: No, I do not have any limitations .
20/12/23, 7:53 pm - Gurvinder: <Media omitted>
