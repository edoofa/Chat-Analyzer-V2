19/09/23, 8:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Kindly mark this date on your calendar and ensure that you are available to complete the necessary procedures within the stipulated timeline. If everything is proceeding as planned so far, shall we move forward and begin our session for the day?
19/09/23, 9:53 pm - +260 96 1242533: Thanks... I am not sure on the above. I guess this is supposed to be responded by our son Ryan. Unfortunately his is currently in boarding school until end of November month. His will be away from home until then. While in school he has no access to a phone or internet. So if there's a way to wait until he's back from school.
19/09/23, 9:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, thank you for letting me know of that. In that case, we can put a hold and proceed with the EWYL process after Ryan's Arrival as well.

19/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Right Mr. Mwale, now moving forward, let me brief you that your admissions process and your EWYL program will operate concurrently in the future, therefore you will have two Whatsapp groups to connect with the team:
19/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. The admissions group *(Ryan 2K23SEP0766R)*  will be the platform where we, as your admission officers, will be communicating with you. This group is dedicated to all-important discussions like your university admission process, offer letter discussion, and ultimately your university registration and reservation of your scholarship along with the Visa process. This group will continue to assist you with your admission-related queries while you are here in India.
19/09/23, 10:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 2. Earn While You Learn Program *(Ryan EWYL23E0701)*. In this group, your EWYL mentor, head of the department, and head coach will be present. With this group, we will make sure you are prepared to self-finance your education here in India. With your dedicated efforts in the EWYL program, you will earn maximum scholarship credits. 

This group will keep a record of the tasks and projects you undertake. You will be provided with the link to the group after the completion of the admission process session and on the dedicated date for your EWYL session, where you will be able to directly speak to your EWYL mentor. I hope you are clear about the purpose of the two groups.
19/09/23, 10:51 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it's getting late and our available time is coming to a close, I'd like to bring our current session to a close. Let's reconvene tomorrow at 7:30 pm. Wishing you a restful night!

22/09/23, 7:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, Mr. Mwale!

I trust this message reaches you in good health. I had been anticipating a response from you, but it seems my previous messages may have gone unnoticed for a quite sometime now. This has raised some concerns on my part, so I wanted to inquire about your well-being and if you might be encountering any challenges at the moment kindly let me know of the same. .
17/10/23, 9:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This message was deleted
17/10/23, 9:15 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening Parents and Ryan,

Over the past couple of weeks, we at Edoofa have been waiting for you to connect with the admissions team and move forward with your university admission journey. However, despite our best efforts, we have not been able to get a response from your end as there has been repeated delays from your side.

We do understand that you might have your reasons because of which you were not able to connect or share an update regarding the challenges. However, your absence has left a negative impression on your scholarship application file, which could result in missing out on your scholarship opportunity.

Hence, the academic board urged us to reach out to you once again and give you an opportunity to transparently share the concerns you have because of which you have not been connecting with the team, so that the relevant solutions can be shared with you.
17/10/23, 9:23 pm - +260 97 7408010: Good evening but if you remember we had said our son was in School and we requested if we could wait for him to finish his exams and then we reconnect.

We have tried our best and answered your queries but Ryan is at School 🏫 right now 🤷🏾‍♀️🤷🏾‍♀️😔
17/10/23, 9:25 pm - +260 96 1242533: Good evening Sir
We thank you for reaching out to us regarding our son's application for a scholarship.
In our interaction with you, we noted that the questions raised seemed to imply that our son was supposed to respond. Thats how we suggested that since he's still in school away from home we requested that the interaction resumes after he closes school at tge end of November after sitting for his exams.
If you feel the questions can be answered by our selves as parents, we have no problem.
17/10/23, 9:28 pm - +260 97 7408010: EXACTLY
17/10/23, 9:29 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: It's clear that Ryan may face some difficulties in attending our session due to exam activities. I kindly request both you and Ryan to be aware that this is a family discussion group, and could also be proceeded exclusively with the parents as well. So, in order for us to proceed shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 4:00 PM?
17/10/23, 9:29 pm - +260 97 7408010: Which negative impression our son is in School preparing for his final year at Secondary
17/10/23, 9:31 pm - +260 97 7408010: Thanks... I am not sure on the above. I guess this is supposed to be responded by our son Ryan. Unfortunately his is currently in boarding school until end of November month. His will be away from home until then. While in school he has no access to a phone or internet. So if there's a way to wait until he's back from school.
17/10/23, 9:32 pm - +260 97 7408010: This was hubby's response 👆🏾
17/10/23, 9:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As it has been already mentioned that when Ryan is not available session the parents can also continue with the session as well.
17/10/23, 9:36 pm - +260 96 1242533: We can attend the next session. Please advise the time
17/10/23, 9:37 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly, So, in order for us to proceed shall we schedule our session for tomorrow at 4:00 PM?
17/10/23, 9:41 pm - +260 96 1242533: 04PM is not ideal as we shall be out of town. I suggest that we schedule to 9PM local time
17/10/23, 9:43 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for the clarification. We appreciate your willingness to participate in the session. We'll adjust the schedule to 9:00 PM local time to accommodate your availability. Let's plan to have our session at that time tomorrow.

If there are any specific topics or concerns you'd like to discuss during the session, please feel free to let us know. We're here to ensure that the discussion is productive and addresses all your queries.

02/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: However, it's essential to strike a balance between your EWYL program commitments and her exam preparations. Hence, when a student is in school, parents can start with the Early While Your Learn (EWYL) program on the student's behalf. In fact, for the first few days, there will be an orientation scheduled that parents can actively participate in.
02/11/23, 9:12 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This orientation is just as crucial as the student's participation and provides valuable insights and guidance on the program's objectives and how parents can effectively support their child's educational journey. Hence, if Ryan is occupied with exams, you on his behalf are free to get started, and we'll ensure you have all the necessary information and resources to make the most out of the EWYL program. Please let me know if we are on the same page here?

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.

14/12/23, 2:47 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
14/12/23, 2:49 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yessir we can start
14/12/23, 3:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 3:30 pm - +260 96 8651816: I've gone through it sir
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
14/12/23, 3:48 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
14/12/23, 3:51 pm - +260 97 7408010: Good afternoon from Zambia 🇿🇲
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
14/12/23, 3:52 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
14/12/23, 4:12 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes I'm following
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
14/12/23, 4:22 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir
14/12/23, 4:23 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
14/12/23, 4:25 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir we can proceed
14/12/23, 4:27 pm - +260 97 7408010: Ryan ❓❓
14/12/23, 5:00 pm - +260 96 8651816: @918384048513 sir I'm I supposed to explain in my own understanding?
14/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: No you are not, I am saring them.
14/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
14/12/23, 6:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch, and then share your understanding you are ready, shall we start with our discussion with me individually? 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention. 

If you are ready, shall I move forward and share all the videos with you?
14/12/23, 6:20 pm - +260 96 8651816: Yes sir

20/12/23, 1:38 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
