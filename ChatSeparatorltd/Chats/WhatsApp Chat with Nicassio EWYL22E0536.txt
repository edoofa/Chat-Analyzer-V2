17/08/23, 3:06 pm - +91 70876 46889: Yes
17/08/23, 3:07 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: The reasons behind Edoofa's creation of the Grant Challenge and its importance in students' development is that numerous students are putting in a lot of effort and commitment, but unfortunately, their hard work doesn't always lead to success. This is why we introduced the Grants – to support those students whom we believe possess remarkable potential and can achieve remarkable accomplishments

They are designed to spark a flame within you. This flame should drive you to exceed your boundaries and attain remarkable progress within the Earn While You Learn Program.
Moreover, these grants also act as a source of encouragement for many people who have hidden talents. Your amazing progress and changes show others how they can do great things by leaving their comfort zones. In simple words, you become a role model who inspires others to overcome their limits and make the most of their abilities.
17/08/23, 4:40 pm - +91 70876 46889: Yes ma'am

21/08/23, 10:24 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Congratulations on submitting 3 forms. Your proactive approach has truly brightened my morning, and I am very proud of your outstanding efforts. Well done, Nicassio 🌟

However, I would like to draw your attention to a few important matters. Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India. 

By following this approach, you can ensure that not a single form goes to waste. Rest assured, as soon as the 2025 admissions open, I will promptly inform you, enabling you to submit all the 2025 forms in a consolidated manner.

So the actual forms that you have submitted right now are 2, the remaining 1 form is of 2025.
21/08/23, 10:26 am - Jasmine Edoofa: I am very well Nicassio. Thank you for asking
21/08/23, 2:46 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *Good Evening*⭐

Your enthusiasm and engagement are what make our community thrive. So, Quickly come on the EWYL LINE and write *NEWSLETTER*. I can't wait to share the Newsletter with you.🎓

29/08/23, 4:25 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Evening
I want to share with you a beautiful aspect of Indian culture – *the festival of Rakhi.* The central theme of Rakhi is the unbreakable bond between brothers and sisters. On this day, sisters tie a colorful thread (the rakhi) around their brothers' wrists as a symbol of their love, protection, and lifelong commitment to each other. In return, brothers shower their sisters with gifts and a promise to stand by them through thick and thin.
29/08/23, 4:28 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: As a result, *I will not be available tomorrow*, allowing me to fully engage in this special occasion with my loved ones. I encourage you all to take this time to learn more about Rakhi, its traditions, and the values it promotes.
I look forward to our continued journey of cultural exploration and learning together.

Wishing you all joy, unity, and growth ☺️

07/09/23, 10:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Well, Done on sharing the form 🌟 
It has been shared with our dedicated counseling team. In the meantime, it is very important that you keep regular communication with the students and address any questions they may have. Our counseling team will contact them directly within 7-10 days.
07/09/23, 10:10 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Yes Please
07/09/23, 10:11 am - Jasmine Edoofa: Nicassio, Currently, the admissions for the year 2025 have not yet commenced. Therefore, it is crucial that you refrain from submitting any forms for the 2025 batch at this time. However, I have an alternate suggestion that can prove beneficial. Gather all the 2025 forms in one designated location and engage with those students. Your primary objective should be to address any queries or concerns they may have, while also providing them with the necessary guidance and motivation to pursue their aspirations in India.

11/10/23, 1:20 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Good Afternoon Nicassio
How did your exam go? I wanted to discuss about the student application forms that you have shared recently

1. *Rumbidzai Rusike* - Student mentioned during the counselling sessions that she is not much aware about your personal experience and journey with Edoofa, including your counselor's role. You are also expected to discuss the application process, the documentation required, and how your journey in India has been progressing. 
2. *Rumbidzai Rusike* - He manetioned that you have not shared anything with him. 
3. *Audrey Fibion* - Student mentioned during the counselling sessions that she is not much aware about your personal experience and journey with Edoofa, including your counselor's role. You are also expected to discuss the application process, the documentation required, and how your journey in India has been progressing.
11/10/23, 2:12 pm - +91 70876 46889: Ok sure thing ma'am
11/10/23, 3:25 pm - +91 70876 46889: Yes... The problem iz that i share the information with the students but they don't read saying that its too long.. Because most of the students you mentioned above i had shared a lot with them
11/10/23, 3:27 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: To address this matter, we've come up with a solution. We'd like you to create a testimonial video after your arrival in India. This video should cover:

a) Your journey with the Edoofa Scholarship Program so far,
b) Any initial concerns or uncertainties you had during the counseling stage,
c) Emphasize the significance of being proactive in counseling sessions and maintaining transparency with your counselor. Explain how these aspects eased your journey into the program. 
d) Share your initial impressions of life in India, focusing on how basic amenities are more affordable compared to your home country (e.g., inexpensive internet and unlimited calls). 
e) Discuss the advantages of being an Edoofian compared to applying through an agent and struggling with the process independently. 
f) Reflect on your university experience and highlight the differences from your home education system.
May I know that are we both on the same page?
11/10/23, 3:29 pm - +91 70876 46889: Yes when is this video expected?
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Certainly, the purpose behind creating this video is to ensure that you provide accurate and precise information to the students. Once you submit the video to me, I'll review and approve it. After that, you can share your video with the students. Does this clarify things for you?
11/10/23, 3:31 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: So the deadline for the video is 13-Nov-2023. I would really appreciate it if you could write your script by tomorrow and then make a 1-2 minutes by Friday. Will you be able to do that?
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - +91 70876 46889: Ok ma'am no problem
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - +91 70876 46889: Ok ma'am i get you
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - +91 70876 46889: Will definitely work on that
11/10/23, 3:32 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great! Are you aware of the upcoming webinar scheduled for this Friday?
11/10/23, 3:33 pm - +91 70876 46889: Yes i am.. Looking forward to it
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that. Now, it's almost time to conclude our session. Do you have any final questions?
11/10/23, 3:36 pm - +91 70876 46889: No so far so good
11/10/23, 3:38 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: Great, it was wonderful talking to you. I hope you had a good time as well. I truly value your active participation. I'll be in touch soon, and I wish you the best of luck with your exams.

What did you learn about the Edoofa Program after interacting with a student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship?
I have learnt that it is a scholarship which helps students to go further with their education even if parents are not able to send their children for further education 

Why should you be accepted into the Edoofa Program (20-40 Words)? 
I think because l am interested in studying by its help, due to the fact that my parents will not be able to send me to university for further studies,, because of their economical situations

I like to study Masters Degree Of International Relations.
I completed a Bachelor Of Arts Dual Honours In Communication And Religious Studies in 2022 and l got an Upper Second Degree Class: 2.1
My preference year of Admission is August 2024.

After an interaction with the student beneficiary of the Edoofa Scholarship l learnt that Edoofa is helping a lot of students who are underprivileged across the globe  to do their studies while they work. That makes life easier for them because of that kind of support.

09/12/23, 3:44 pm - Jasmine Edoofa: *SATURDAY ACTIVITY*
I hope this message finds you well. 

Today's Saturday activity is designed to help us get familiar with Microsoft Excel, a powerful tool for data organization and analysis. We'll begin with a simple yet practical exercise: creating a Weekly Activity Log and Time Tracker.

Activity Instructions:

Open Microsoft Excel:

Launch Microsoft Excel on your computer or phone. If you don't have it installed, you can use any spreadsheet software available to you.
Set Up Columns:

Create three columns with the following headers: "Activity," "Day of the Week," and "Time Spent (in minutes)."
Record Your Activities:

Think about the activities you engaged in during the past week, such as studying, exercising, or socializing.
In the "Activity" column, list each activity separately.
Specify Days:

In the "Day of the Week" column, record the corresponding day for each activity.
Log Time:

In the "Time Spent" column, record the amount of time (in minutes) you spent on each activity.
Calculate Average Time:

Utilize Excel functions to calculate the average time spent per activity and the overall average time for the week.
Reflect:

In a designated area, jot down a brief reflection on your insights from tracking activities and time spent.
Save and Submit:

Save the file with an appropriate name (e.g., "WeeklyActivityLog_YourName.xlsx").
Submit the completed spreadsheet following the instructions provided.

Remember, this activity serves as an introduction to Microsoft Excel, and we'll build on these skills in future sessions. Feel free to reach out if you encounter any challenges during the activity.

Let's dive in and make the most of today's exploration of Excel!

Best regards,

As we gear up for another enriching session this Wednesday, I wanted to inform you of the exciting topic we will be delving into – the virtues of honesty and hard work.

In our quest for academic excellence and personal growth, understanding and embodying these virtues are fundamental. Honesty, as the bedrock of integrity, plays a pivotal role in shaping our character and building trust within our academic community. We will explore its significance not only in academic pursuits but also in fostering open communication and self-awareness.

Additionally, we will dive into the realm of hard work – a virtue that propels us towards success. From setting realistic goals to managing our time efficiently, the commitment to hard work is a key ingredient in the recipe for achievement.🌟

I encourage you to come prepared for an engaging discussion, ready to share your insights and experiences related to these virtues. Let's create an environment where we can learn from each other and inspire one another to embody these virtues in our academic and personal lives.

Looking forward to our Wednesday session and the insightful conversations that are sure to unfold

4. Financial Need: Pursuing higher education can be financially challenging, especially for students from less privileged backgrounds. As the first person in my family to have the opportunity to attend university, I am determined to overcome any financial obstacles that may arise. The Edoofa University Scholarship would provide me with the financial support I need to focus on my studies and contribute to society without the burden of excessive student loans.

5. Commitment to Edoofa's Mission: Upon researching Edoofa and its mission, I was deeply inspired by the organization's dedication to providing educational opportunities to deserving students. I resonate with Edoofa's commitment to empowering individuals through education and believe that I can contribute positively to the Edoofa community.

In conclusion, I am confident that my academic achievements, leadership skills, extracurricular involvement, financial need, and alignment with Edoofa's mission make me a strong candidate for the Edoofa University Scholarship. I am eager to take advantage of this opportunity to further my education and make a meaningful impact in my chosen field of study.
