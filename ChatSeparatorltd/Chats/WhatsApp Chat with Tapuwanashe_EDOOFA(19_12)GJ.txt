But during the covid, the Government realized that students from African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.
20/12/23, 9:23 am - +263 78 784 1596: Oh ok that's nice to know but I am looking forward to score points more than that😀

20/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 78 784 1596: Ok I can say 5 years later I see my self as successful chartered accountant or I would have a carrier in investment,  banking and account, more often running successful businesses

20/12/23, 10:49 am - +263 78 784 1596: Ah firstly,  I want to experience a new culture, studying abroad allows to immerse my self in a new culture and experience new ways of living

Further,I gain independence and maturity without the comfort of home

Moreso, I will develop my language skill, learning new languages ,meeting new friends 

I also get a chance to study without obstacles like those faced in Zimbabwe like faults in electrical outlet ,net work problems
20/12/23, 10:52 am - Garima Edoofa: Okay so basically, you are aiming to have maximum exposure in life because of which you are planning to study abroad.

In that case, now I would like you to tell, me that If you are given this opportunity to pursue your higher education through this scholarship, how are you planning to contribute your learnings from abroad towards the development of the education system in your country?

20/12/23, 11:10 am - Garima Edoofa: I appreciate your sense of hard work for your community Tapuwanashe, but to help develop your country's own education system and provide such facilities to your community you would have to first be a reputed personality in your country, and to do that you would have to study with your utmost dedication which would only be possible if you have a conducive environment around you. 

Don’t you agree?
20/12/23, 11:13 am - +263 78 784 1596: Yes I agree mam
20/12/23, 11:14 am - Garima Edoofa: Since you are aware that, through the Edoofa Scholarship Program, students get an opportunity to study in India.

I am sure you must be wondering why Edoofa recommends India as a higher education destination when India shares a similar history with most of the African Nations of being a British Colony for over 200 years, isn’t it?
20/12/23, 11:16 am - +263 78 784 1596: Yah ,I had that question in mind ,may you further explain to me why Edoofa recommends India
20/12/23, 11:26 am - Garima Edoofa: Yes please.

20/12/23, 2:23 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is remarkable, Tapuwanashe. I see that you understand the quality of higher education that Edoofa seeks to deliver to its students so that after completing the education, the students is capable of achieving their career goals and having a prosperous career ahead of them.

Okay, so are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
20/12/23, 2:24 pm - +263 78 784 1596: No I am not aware and no one is aware
20/12/23, 2:28 pm - Garima Edoofa: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is *around 6000-8000 USD. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from USD 15000 to USD 35000. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000*.



Now as we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with over 250+ Universities for the last 13 + years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 5 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*

20/12/23, 2:30 pm - +263 78 784 1596: Ok I understand
20/12/23, 2:33 pm - Garima Edoofa: In simple words Tapuwanashe what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost nearly $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food, and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, but *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*
20/12/23, 2:36 pm - +263 78 784 1596: Ok mam I get it
20/12/23, 2:40 pm - Garima Edoofa: *Shall I brief you about the Earn While You Learn Program in depth?*
20/12/23, 2:41 pm - +263 78 784 1596: Yes mam u may
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: The Earn While You Learn Program or the *EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program*. It is a program in which the students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
20/12/23, 2:43 pm - Garima Edoofa: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
20/12/23, 2:45 pm - +263 78 784 1596: Yeah i get it
20/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: EWYL Program has been solidified and strengthened only because of the vision it has set, and the alignment of the industry leaders with it. So, here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

2. *Recruitment Partners*: -

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their education completion. These opportunities have been exclusively created for our Edoofians to get placed and start their professional journey in the sectors and fields they have already worked and have experienced through the EWYL Program. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
-Nigenuis
-Skooqs
-Success Magazine
-TIA Organics
20/12/23, 2:47 pm - Garima Edoofa: 3. *Webinars*: -

We understand the importance of learning through the experience of others, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are: -

20/12/23, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increases.
20/12/23, 2:48 pm - Garima Edoofa: What are your views on the same? Do you think this will be benefiting you?
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - +263 78 784 1596: That's good ,this will also benefit me
20/12/23, 3:08 pm - Garima Edoofa: That is great to know, so now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food, and accommodation*, which means for the monthly family cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
20/12/23, 3:09 pm - Garima Edoofa: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.
