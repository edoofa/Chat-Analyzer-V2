19/10/23, 4:35 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well, I am sure after seeing all these amazing facts, you are intrigued to study in India. So can you now tell me 

1)How would studying in India implement a positive impact on your child’s career?

2)How do you aim to make sure that your child achieves her/his career aspirations from studying in India? <This message was edited>
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 240 0963: My aim is for him to find a better job
19/10/23, 5:20 pm - +263 77 240 0963: And to increase in knowledge
19/10/23, 5:23 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Thank you for sharing this Ms. Irene, So, are you or any of your family members aware of the expense of a comparable quality higher education for an international student without a scholarship in India?
19/10/23, 8:58 pm - +263 71 691 8724: We can't really tell how much it is,but it is more than just expensive indeed
19/10/23, 9:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Joseph, I understand!!!
19/10/23, 9:04 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
19/10/23, 9:06 pm - +263 71 691 8724: Thank you so much 8pm is oky
19/10/23, 10:48 pm - +263 77 240 0963: It's  very expensive to learn abroad without a scholarship
20/10/23, 9:38 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good Morning,

I am here to begin our session

Are you ready?
20/10/23, 10:25 am - +263 77 240 0963: Morning  i am ready
20/10/23, 10:29 am - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today, Ms. Irene.
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable.

Let me share with you the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries in depth!
In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *$6000-$8000 per year*. While this is very low as compared to other Western education hubs such as the US, UK, Canada, Germany, etc., it is still beyond the reach of many.
With the Edoofa Scholarship Program, the cost trips down to *$2000-$3000* for the students who are found Eligible for the program by qualifying the Eligibility check Process.
This reduced cost includes:
*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, Wifi, Laundry, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
20/10/23, 10:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/10/23, 11:01 am - +263 77 240 0963: Yes it's affordable
20/10/23, 11:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that!!!

So let me tell you something exclusive and very beneficial for Edoofians. Looking at this cost of education, there are possibilities that this may not be affordable to all. So Edoofa provides work opportunities to the students while studying so that they can earn scholarship credits which can help you in reducing their fees further.


And do you know how that is done?
20/10/23, 1:48 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Joseph, Are we connected?
20/10/23, 2:45 pm - +263 71 691 8724: Stage 1
20/10/23, 2:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Well,
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
20/10/23, 4:04 pm - +263 71 691 8724: Yes am here,jus facing network problems
20/10/23, 4:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's Alright, Joseph
20/10/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Please let me explain the other 2 steps too
20/10/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
20/10/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
20/10/23, 4:07 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
20/10/23, 7:08 pm - +263 71 691 8724: Yes let's proceed
