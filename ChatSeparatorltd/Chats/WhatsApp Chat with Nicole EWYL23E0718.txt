05/10/23, 8:24 am - Ananya Edoofa: I understand your situation, and therefore, let us do one thing. Let us opt for a fast-track process to complete your basic understanding of the initial sessions. For this fast-track process, I would like you to be available with me for at least two days at the above-mentioned time. Now, please let me know which days you can join me.

05/10/23, 8:32 am - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you Ms Ananya, for the interesting information😘😘
05/10/23, 8:32 am - +263 78 056 8487: I happy to know about you on a better level ma'am. I can say I feel comfortable and excited to have you as my mentor already!

05/10/23, 8:46 am - +263 78 056 8487: Well as I've mentioned I'm Nicole Rufaro Chigwaza. I'm currently doing my last year in Alevel. I'm doing Sciences Math, Biology and Chemistry. Biology is my favourite subjects. I'm not that much into sports but I enjoy reading novels. I'm not that talkative and enjoy spending time alone most of the time but I can also be friendly. My short term goal is to pass my Alevel. I wanted to do Medicine but unfortunately I can't since I don't do Physics. But I believe BSc in Cardiovascular Technology will still make me reach my goals.
05/10/23, 8:47 am - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Nicole! Seems like we have a lot in common! You know I also love reading Novels!✨
05/10/23, 8:52 am - +263 78 056 8487: That's great to hear ma'am! Novels are my getaway and therapy.
05/10/23, 8:53 am - +27 78 844 5287: That's greet indeed ma'am. 😘😘😘😘😘😘
05/10/23, 8:54 am - +27 78 844 5287: 👏👏
05/10/23, 8:56 am - Ananya Edoofa: Now that I've learned about you, I'd like to tell you about your *EWYL team*. Because our journey will be long, it will be beneficial to get to know each other well. The entire EWYL team works tirelessly to ensure that our *two key objectives* are met. Do you understand what these two objectives are?
05/10/23, 8:59 am - +263 78 056 8487: No I don't understand.
05/10/23, 8:59 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skill set and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals. <This message was edited>
05/10/23, 9:00 am - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education* Yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money, rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
05/10/23, 9:03 am - +263 78 056 8487: Okay I understand ma'am.
05/10/23, 9:05 am - +27 78 844 5287: Noted with thanks maam
05/10/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
05/10/23, 9:06 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 9:10 am - +27 78 844 5287: That's good, thank you for the good advice.
05/10/23, 9:11 am - Ananya Edoofa: Great now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Sanjana* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Sanjana and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skill set through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
05/10/23, 9:11 am - +263 78 056 8487: Noted.
05/10/23, 9:12 am - +27 78 844 5287: Noted
05/10/23, 9:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: I would also like you to be informed of our program structure, which mandates us to connect a minimum of 4 times a week i.e., you will be having 2 sessions on either Monday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday. Along with this, on Wednesday I will be sharing the lesson of the week, or as we call it Wednesday Wisdom, wherein we will try to cover a skillset which will be followed by a weekend activity. The weekend activity will ensure that you practically execute what you learned from the Wednesday Wisdom lesson. The activity will be shared every Saturday. The deadlines for submissions will be shared along with the lesson and activity on the respective days.
*Sounds interesting, right?*
05/10/23, 9:14 am - +263 78 056 8487: Yes it sounds very interesting!
05/10/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
05/10/23, 9:15 am - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
05/10/23, 9:30 am - +27 78 844 5287: Thank you so much for sharing this information.

05/10/23, 9:32 am - +263 78 056 8487: I feel motivated after reading this. I'm now sure I've made the right decision.
05/10/23, 9:33 am - +27 78 844 5287: We will do that, now I don't have doubt with you any more, at first I was doubting and not trusting, I thought it was a scam, but my daughter keep on challenging me till today.
Once again thank you so much, my daughter she is so happy she said she can't wait to come there.
06/10/23, 11:29 am - +27 78 844 5287: From what learned or understanding from the Edoofa program  is ready to provide Edoofians a  better life opportunity, like jobs, businesses  etc.
As a parent I really appreciate Edoofa scholarship because you want young ones to be ready for future.
We thank you Edoofa because you had multiple of projects it's very courages to have that good opportunity in life we appreciate.
Edoofa you also learn 21 st century new age skills which helps to become employable whenever you approach for a job, we are thankful for that.

We thank you so much, we learnt a lot from this reading passage hopefully we will spread the message of Edoofa which youth likes more.
06/10/23, 11:31 am - +27 78 844 5287: My apology error typing from what I learned.
06/10/23, 11:37 am - +27 78 844 5287: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know what Nicole, this is fantastic! This is the kind of comprehension needed in an Edoofian, and voila! You are already so good at it.🏆
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I will start by explaining the projects in detail. I am sharing an audio file with you. Here’s my suggestion- listen to it at least twice, you know- to make sure we don’t miss anything out, and then get back to me when you are finished with the process!
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
06/10/23, 3:34 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly share your understaning with me before our next session. Our next session is on Monday. We do not have our sessions on Saturdays and Sundays. 

Happy Weekend!🌸
06/10/23, 4:13 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon she will come back to you after school, my apology.
06/10/23, 4:20 pm - +263 71 298 0344: Good day
06/10/23, 4:21 pm - +263 71 298 0344: Kindly note Nicole is still at school, shewill join in soon
07/10/23, 7:34 am - +263 78 056 8487: I'll be sure to go through the projects thoroughly.

Thank you ma'am!

Enjoy your weekend!
07/10/23, 5:36 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good afternoon ma'am. I hope you are enjoying your weekend.

From what I've understood from the audio file. The first project is Cooperate Alliance project. The aim here is for me to understand the market that I'll be working for in the future and start preparing myself for it at an early stage. I've also been informed that due to the pandemic there are great chances for me to connect with companies that are technologically and digital in nature. I've been advised that I have to first identify the people around me including my family and friends who work in the service sector and tell them about my objectives and my involvement with the Edoofa program mentioning how it's helping me develop the skills required for the my employment in the future after my graduation which is very true. 

I'll also have to create a Linkton account. From what I've understood Linkton is a business platform where I can look for companies as well as employees who are working for those companies to connect with them. Assistance will be provided to me to create the Linkton account. I'll be communicating with different business people through the Linkton platform and make sure to take their contact numbers to set up a meeting with Edoofa. 

I'll have to show the meeting time so that the Edoofian team can talk to the business people about the business aspects that will be created for me once the alliance is finished. 

A document will be shared with me that will have information or advices that will help throughout my whole communication with the business people. Connecting with the companies will help me explore my network.  It will gain me leverage and credibility which will help me in my life projects, industrial exposure and even a job in my country. Getting a job in my country will help me contribute to my country by creating a small but significant and deep impact.
09/10/23, 8:28 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole!

How was your weekend? Are you ready for your session?🚀
09/10/23, 8:40 am - +27 78 844 5287: Good morning ma'am, We are all doing well.

09/10/23, 8:48 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, @27788445287 

I am sharing the audios for the other two projects so that Nicole can have a clear understanding of all the projects that were discussed in the Document! 

Kindly ask Nicole to listen to them carefully and share her understanding with me.

I know you're all deep into your studies, and that's fantastic! 📚 But I wanted to share an incredible video with you that I believe can help alleviate some of the exam stress. 🌟

Watch the Video Here : *https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnpQrMqDoqE&pp=ygU1aGVscGZ1bCB2aWRlbyBmb3IgZXhhbSBzdHJlc3MgZm9yIHN0dWRlbnRzIGluIGVuZ2xpc2g%3D*

Take a little break, relax, and let this video inspire and motivate you. You've got this! 💪
Wishing you all the best of luck with your exams! Stay focused and keep shining. ✨
19/10/23, 1:55 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon.

Thank you so much.

Thank you for the best wishes. I really appreciate them.
20/10/23, 7:48 am - +263 78 056 8487: From the video I've learnt that stress is just a physical reaction. All I have to do when I'm stressed is take a few breaths to calm myself.

Stress is also a survival mechanism. It's either you fight or run away. And due to stress of the exams I've decided to calm myself and study for the next exams.
20/10/23, 12:36 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Great, I really hope that this will help you in your future endeavors. 🌟

30/10/23, 3:54 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Nicole busy writing exams. She will come back to you
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings of the day!

I hope you are having a great start to the week. Edoofa is an organization that fosters careers and empowers students to progress in a more positive direction, achieving the right balance of exposure and opportunities, alongside education, is essential for a student's overall growth.

With this principle in mind, I am thrilled to share how our students are balancing correctly between exposure and experience with their academics:

⭕A group of our students recently participated in a football tournament, and we are immensely proud to announce that they reached the competition's semifinals.

⭕Another group of students participated in a debate competition, and I am delighted to add that two of our students emerged as winners.

⭕Furthermore, our students regularly come together for interactive sessions with their fellow Edoofians, building stronger relationships and providing mutual support.
31/10/23, 7:30 pm - Ananya Edoofa: ◾ Being your mentor, as your child prepares to join us in India, I would like to know: What kind of skills or exposure would you want to be a part of during your time here?

14/12/23, 12:06 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Nicole!

Your session has already started on your EWYL Line, and I am quite disappointed with the fact that I always have to share a reminder with you to join your session. Can I know, is it that difficult to follow your schedule?
14/12/23, 12:52 pm - +263 78 056 8487: My sincere apologies. It's not that difficult ma'am. The only problem is that I'm only connected to Wi-Fi at night. And during the day I have to find other ways of being online.
14/12/23, 12:57 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good afternoon mentor Ananya? Hope you are doing well.
My apology, the problem is Wi- fi but once she get it she will come back to you ma'am.
14/12/23, 1:02 pm - +263 78 056 8487: And my family and I are currently having issues on paying the registration fee. And honestly it's affecting me because I don't know if I should continue putting effort in the EWYL program when there's a possibility of me not continuing anymore.

But I'm very sorry for my lack of focus.
14/12/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I understand that the network is a major issue. Could you let me know if there is a specific time duration when there are no such problems? Alternatively, I am open to extending the session duration so that Nicole won't lag behind. <This message was edited>
14/12/23, 5:47 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Is 8p.m okay?
15/12/23, 8:25 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole!

Kindly excuse me; however, I am afraid that I cannot accommodate your request to reschedule your session to 8:00 p.m. as our available hours are from 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
15/12/23, 8:25 am - +27 78 844 5287: Good morning ma'am? Hope you are doing well.
She will come back to you mma.
15/12/23, 4:48 pm - +263 78 056 8487: I'm a proud Edoofian!
16/12/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, @263780568487 

How are you doing today? Have you followed your EWYL ritual today?
16/12/23, 2:35 pm - +27 78 844 5287: Good day my mentor? Hope you are doing well.
It seems like network problem, let me try to check her
16/12/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, @27788445287

19/12/23, 4:46 pm - +263 78 056 8487: Good afternoon ma'am. I started on with the 10 day project and approached two school heads via online but they blue ticked me after explaining.

How can I make a better approach? Or what should I do?
20/12/23, 9:18 am - Ananya Edoofa: Good morning, Nicole!

I hope you are doing well. I really appreciate how you have this tendency of improving yourself; I am really impressed, Nicole! Now, in order to help you in a better way, can you please share the screenshots with me?
