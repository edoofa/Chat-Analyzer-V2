18/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Well received, Denzel, let me share more about the program with you.

You see, *Edoofa Scholarship Program* is a well-appreciated program in the SAARC nations and the African continent offering 50-100% scholarships on tuition fees. Over the past 6 years, we have worked with 250+ Universities in India and have a community of more than 4000 students from different African countries.

18/12/23, 2:59 pm - Harmehak: Speaking specifically about Zimbabwe, we have more than 2000 students enrolled in the program. 
We are associated with more than 200 schools in Zimbabwe. Some of the most elite Schools in Zimbabawe example in Harare we are collaborated with St. Dominic’s Chishawasha, Dominican Convent, Christ Ministries and many others.

I appreciate the honesty and transparency you have shown in expressing yourself!
18/12/23, 5:49 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Thank you
18/12/23, 5:52 pm - Harmehak: Well Denzil, now as we proceed ahead, I would like to your thoughts on higher education abroad!

Do you believe it's a life changing decision?
18/12/23, 5:54 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah I believe it's very beneficial and also a platform for me to get out there and learn new things
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - Harmehak: Very well and would you add that you are mentally prepared for a life abroad too, Denzel?
18/12/23, 6:14 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes 100 percent prepared
18/12/23, 6:15 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, I am delighted to see your dedication and I believe you would agree with me that commitment from your parents is equally important!

So now could you please share, if your family members are aware of your plans to study abroad and if they are willing to support your higher education abroad mentally and financially?
18/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh yes I told my mother way before the closure of schools and she was fine with it and others too are in support of the idea but financially that could be challenging that's why she urged me to look for a scholarship
18/12/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: While I understand, can you please elaborate regarding the financial aspect, Denzel?
18/12/23, 6:20 pm - +263 71 315 9928: So am actually saying that I really like studying abroad but I believe the total cost of Education can be expensive that's why am looking for a scholarship to lessen the burden
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - Harmehak: Yes please, I do understand Denzel!

So is your mother willing to support you financially along with the scholarship?
18/12/23, 6:23 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah I believe so
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate.
18/12/23, 6:25 pm - Harmehak: I would like to brief you that, as per the eligibility criteria before the covid, the minimum points required was 6 points in order to be eligible for the scholarship. But during the covid, the Government realized that students from the African countries, in your case from Zimbabwe, are not from a privileged background to afford a private high school, which has the provision of online classes that can be done by the students during the lockdown. In order to help the students get a quality education and a scholarship, the Government has reconsidered the eligibility criteria and as per the latest guidelines, *the eligibility for the scholarship is a minimum of 2 Advanced Level passes.*

Even though the minimum requirement is two A-level passes, I always encourage my students to aim for maximum points to increase their chances for a higher quantum of scholarship. I hope you are confident!
18/12/23, 6:26 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh okay I do understand.... Yaaah don't wry mam I won't let you down
18/12/23, 6:29 pm - Harmehak: That's great, Denzel!
18/12/23, 6:30 pm - Harmehak: Okay, can you share your O Level results with me for evaluation along with what motivates you to study Law or Human resource management?
18/12/23, 7:16 pm - Harmehak: I was expecting your response, now, I would be scheduling your session for *tomorrow at 10 AM CAT*, as my working hours for the day are over and it's already been a long day. If you have a query please write it down so that I can respond to it in the morning.

*Please note that your participation in the Session is most important while determining the scholarship Percentage, therefore I would like you to be online at the above mentioned time for a smooth conversation.*
18/12/23, 7:47 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh am sorry mam due to power cuts here my battery had drained but I appreciate talking to you talk tomorrow then
18/12/23, 7:48 pm - +263 71 315 9928: <Media omitted>

18/12/23, 7:52 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Then on human resource management I just love it and also value the welfare of others so it can be another practical platform for me to showcase these things...
19/12/23, 9:59 am - Harmehak: Good morning, hope you are doing well!

As discussed, I am here to continue with our discussion. Shall we start please?
19/12/23, 10:09 am - +263 71 315 9928: Yes maam
19/12/23, 10:12 am - Harmehak: Received please

19/12/23, 10:13 am - Harmehak: I can understand Denzel,

So would you agree both the fields are completely different from one another?
19/12/23, 10:13 am - +263 71 315 9928: Thank you maam
19/12/23, 10:14 am - +263 71 315 9928: Yes ma'am I do affirm that they are different
19/12/23, 10:16 am - Harmehak: Very correct,

So which out of the two are you more inclined towards, Denzel?
19/12/23, 10:17 am - +263 71 315 9928: International law
19/12/23, 10:17 am - Harmehak: Noted please,

So what all did you research about your desired course?
19/12/23, 10:20 am - +263 71 315 9928: International law is a pretty broad topic, but I can give you a general overview. International law refers to the rules and agreements that govern the relationships between countries. It covers things like trade, human rights, environmental protection, and conflict resolution. There are different bodies that oversee international law, like the United Nations and the International Court of Justice.
19/12/23, 10:25 am - Harmehak: I am glad to see that you thoroughly researched and you have proper knowledge regarding your desired field.

On that note, let me brief you about your course.
19/12/23, 10:26 am - +263 71 315 9928: Okay I would appreciate ma'am

*2) Lawyer*

A lot of dedication and hard work is required to complete this course with your law degree, but on successful completion, this career can be extremely rewarding.

A career in law is considered to be much sought after, satisfying and lucrative.

*Required Skill-Set for BA LLB*
It is rightly said that learning is an on – going process and this holds true especially in the aspect of personal and professional development. Although an individual may possess certain skills they need to be improved and developed constantly. A few key skills that are of paramount importance in the field of law are:

*Good Written Communication*– Writing forms a major part of the work in in the legal profession. The written communication involves letters, documents, notices, and so on. The documents must be grammatically correct and error free. This requires a good level of English proficiency.

*Good Verbal Communication*– A lot depends on how well the legal professional can express his or her case, arguments and generally converse with clients and authorities. Good verbal communication ensures good expression and understanding which are crucial for a successful career in law.

*Good Time Management*– In the legal profession, time management is very crucial. The art of delegating tasks, working within deadlines, and prioritizing tasks to achieve success is very essential.

*A great degree of self-confidence*– This profession needs a high degree of self-confidence to win the clients’ trust. A strong belief in yourself will go a long way in winning arguments and cases.

*An analytical mind and good research skills*– A case with proper research and well-reasoned out and evaluated argument stands a very high chance of success.

*High EQ (Emotional Quotient)*– Individuals in the legal profession, especially lawyers, must learn to be empathetic.

*Tech Savvy*– In the rapidly developing and evolving technological world, they must be abreast of the latest technology to understand and use it, as and when needed. They need to use technology to their advantage to improve their efficiency and chances of success.

*Good Commercial awareness*– This is not only restricted to being aware of the current trends and technology, prevalent in the world of business and law, but also being aware of the developments in the world of business and law, both nationally and globally.

*A high degree of patience*– This is a much needed skill, since you deal with different types of people and some cases and procedures stretch over a period of time which need a lot of patience and careful handling.

*Team player skills*– Since a legal professional will deal with a lot of people therefore to be effective they need to bond with people. The art of getting work done and obtaining information though networking and working with people helps in attaining the objectives.

19/12/23, 5:00 pm - Harmehak: I am glad this intrigued you and you found it helpful!

So, now that you have understood why Edoofa recommends India, as we move ahead with our discussion, *by any chance are you or your family members are familiar with the cost of similar quality higher eduation for an international student without any scholarship in India itself?*
19/12/23, 5:06 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes I believe I have some idea about the costs without a scholarship
19/12/23, 5:09 pm - Harmehak: Alright please,

Can you share your knowledge with me?
19/12/23, 5:12 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Well I don't know much but I believe that  the cost of studying in India can vary greatly depending on the university and the field of study. On average, a bachelor's degree in India can cost anywhere from around $2,000 to $20,000 per year, depending on the university and the program. A master's degree can cost between $5,000 and $30,000 per year, and a PhD can cost between $10,000 and $40,000 per year.  That's all I know ma'am
19/12/23, 5:14 pm - Harmehak: Duly received, Denzel
19/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Let me brief you about the cost of higher education in India with respect to other countries and how Edoofa makes it affordable for students.

The cost of tertiary education in India is much lower than in Western countries. In India, the average cost of Higher Education for international students is around *6000-8000 USD*. In contrast, tuition fees for higher education in the UK, for example, can range from *USD 15000 to USD 35000*. Meanwhile, the US tuition cost is much higher, with the average cost of a 4-year degree ranging from *USD 80,000 to over USD 250,000.*
19/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Now we wanted to make this cost of education even more affordable for the parents and students, *this is why our Parent Organisation Anhad Edutrain Solutions has worked with 250+ Universities for the last 14 years by helping them have the Employability Aspect in their education because of which from last 6 years Universities have been helping us to provide scholarship seats to the students so that their cost of education is reduced greatly.*
19/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: Therefore, for the selected students who are able to qualify for the EDOOFA Program by undergoing various tests, the cost comes down to $2000-$3000 per year. This cost includes:

*1. Remaining Tuition fees (if any)*
*2. Basic University Expenses (Library, etc.)*
*3. Food*
*4. Accommodation*
19/12/23, 5:15 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 5:21 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh thank you ma'am for the insight I believe Edoofa is really an elixir to financial issues
19/12/23, 5:26 pm - Harmehak: In simple words Denzel, what we do is, we reduce the cost of education of a student from $8000 to almost near $3000 a year, which includes their Accommodation, Food and Basic University Expenses for the year as well, *after this we give the opportunity to the students to reduce their remaining annual fee as much as they can through our Earn While You Learn Program.*

However as per my experience, I can share with you that *if you are able to perform and clear all these criteria with a high passing grade, you would be eligible for our 90- 100% Scholarship*, in which you will just have to pay a minimal fee of *$1200-$1800*, Which would cover your entire fees be it food, accommodation, Tuition etc.
19/12/23, 5:29 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh thank you ma'am the last part sound good
19/12/23, 5:29 pm - Harmehak: I appreciate
19/12/23, 5:30 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, Senior Academician Mr Piyush were in Zimbabwe for about 90 days, from his experience and what a lot of my Zimbabwean students have shared, having a tertiary education can end up costing a student roughly around $3000-$4000 a year in Zimbabwe,

While cost of education is limited to $1200-$1500 a year, cost of living in Zimbabwe is quite high, where even a staple meal of Sadza and curry costs a student $1 for one time. 

This means roughly around $1100 are spent on just food while cost of basic necessities like internet, accommodation, traveling end up making a total of $2000-$2500 a year. 

Wouldn't you agree to the same?
19/12/23, 5:32 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes I affirm the cost of living here for students is expensive
19/12/23, 5:32 pm - Harmehak: Very correct!

So now are you in a better position to relate how Edoofa is making higher education affordable and accessible for international students in India, Denzel?
19/12/23, 5:34 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes ma'am I do understand
19/12/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: That's great,

Now let's discuss the Earn While You Learn Program in detail and how it would assist you.
19/12/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: The Earn While You Learn Program or the EWYL Program is the backbone of Edoofa and the unique aspect of the whole program is that students are given real-time live online projects during which they gain excellent work experience while getting the opportunity to earn scholarship credits (based on a student’s performance) that is equivalent to physical cash. However, the credits can be used to pay off a significant part of their higher education fees and make their university education more affordable.
19/12/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: It is the curriculum of the Earn While You Learn Program that helps students to learn and develop 21st-century job skills like Research, Content Writing, SEO, Digital Marketing, Creative Content Creation, Influencer Marketing, Social Media Engagement, and Blog Writing – just to name a few.

The EWYL Program, therefore, is going to help in the overall growth of a student and help them provide a boost in keeping up with the changing market strategies, needs, and tactics.
19/12/23, 5:36 pm - Harmehak: Here are a few examples and accomplishments of the EWYL Program, which Edoofa only focuses on increasing and broadening.

The EWYL Program has been recognized and appreciated by a lot of market leaders. The following are:

Africa Global Radio - The company joined hands with Edoofa, to provide students exposure to the Digital world and the skills used to create a stronghold in the market. You can use the following links to learn about the experience of AGR and Edoofians working on this project.

Skooqs - This is an Edtech company that provides technical courses in the field of animation, AI, and coding languages and they joined hands with Edoofa, to give our Edoofians a chance to work for their brand.

2. Recruitment Partners:

Edoofa through EWYL has created such a holistic environment that some brands and companies have joined hands with Edoofa to recruit and hire our young Edoofians, after their completion of professional courses. Some of the brands that are always eager to hire an Edoofian are:-
Nigenuis
Skooqs
Success Magazine
TIA Organics

3. Webinars:

We understand the importance of first-hand industrial exposure, and hence the EWYL Program also conducts webinars on a regular basis with the current leaders in the business field. Some of the webinars that have been conducted by Edoofa are:

19/12/23, 5:50 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah this sounds amazing I believe this is when a student can work for another company while still persuing with his/her studies?
19/12/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: You would begin with your Earn While You Learn Program while you are still in Zimbabwe and then continue with it once you are in India too!
19/12/23, 5:57 pm - Harmehak: So now, if I have to help you explain properly how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student, let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $1800 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth *$100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year*, and that would basically bring the cost further down to *$600 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation*, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $50-$60 a month.

_*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly.*_
19/12/23, 5:59 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ooooh wow that's great I didn't know that
19/12/23, 6:00 pm - Harmehak: I can understand!
19/12/23, 6:00 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Wow wonderful indeed I have understood now
19/12/23, 6:18 pm - Harmehak: You would be glad to know about the students who managed to cater for a major part of their remaining annual fee through the Earn While you Learn Program of Edoofa.

19/12/23, 6:22 pm - Harmehak: That is great, now as we have covered majorly everything from the counseling session, so let me help you understand how Edoofa makes the Application fee affordable for the students as well. However, for that you would have to be proactive for the next 20 minutes. 

Are you ready?
19/12/23, 6:22 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes ma'am am ready
19/12/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, as per my experience whenever a student plans to study abroad, for application process they need to fill out an application form, write a statement of purpose, and obtain a letter of recommendation. On average, applying to one university can cost between $300-$450 due to the costs of the application fee, statement of purpose, and recommendation letter. Even though after incurring such a cost a student isn’t given a guarantee by a university, which is why they end up applying in multiple universities just to increase their chances of admission along with a scholarship.
19/12/23, 6:24 pm - Harmehak: *Considering cost of applying in 1 University ranges between $300-$450, if a student applies in 5 Universities how much would the student end up spending?*
19/12/23, 6:34 pm - Harmehak: @263713159928
19/12/23, 6:57 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Ummm about $1500-$2250
19/12/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Exactly, and you see this is not affordable for parents out there, which is why we want to make the application process affordable for the student as well, so for a student to be a part of the Edoofa Program he/she would only have to pay $750.
19/12/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: *But, as we know the COVID 19 Pandemic has slowed down everything around the world which is why we have decided for this period a part of the Enrollment fee would be paid by the Edoofa Program which gives the student a privilege to become a part of the Edoofa Program with the Program Fee with just $350.*
19/12/23, 6:58 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, Edoofa offers a guarantee of admission and scholarship to eligible students who are able to first qualify for the eligibility check.*The enrollment fee includes, assistance with creating statement of purpose, recommendation letter, multiple university applications, and visa assistance, along with training in the Earn While You Learn Program.* This means students don't have to pay separate fees for multiple applications, SOPs, or recommendations. Edoofa is revolutionizing the admission process for international students. 

Don’t you think so?
19/12/23, 7:00 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah I think soo
19/12/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: That's amazing, so now that you have understood how Edoofa makes the application process affordable for the student, let me share with you the payment policy of the same for your better understanding!
19/12/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: Basically there are 3 phases of the enrollment process. 

Phase 1: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation

If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.

Phase 2: Once the students complete their Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-Level result is out).

Phase 3: Once the final A level results are out if the student would have passed the necessary requirement as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission would be continued. However if the student wouldn't have met the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the paid $350 would be refunded to the parents. 

The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment itself.
19/12/23, 7:08 pm - Harmehak: *However, as we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because of which a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*
19/12/23, 7:17 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay that's clear ma'am I understand
19/12/23, 7:17 pm - Harmehak: That's great
19/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Now let me tell you about the Edoofa Cycle which defines the process an applicant has to follow in order to secure the scholarship and admission, please refer to the image which I have shared.
19/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: Alright, so as we are at Step 1, after this you would be proceeding ahead to Step 2, and then if you would pass Step 2 you would receive your Acceptance Letter in Step 3, and after that, as you can see in the above image that the Enrollment Formalities is your Step 4 of the Edoofa Cycle, therefore in your Step 5: We will start your Admission Process as well as your SEELS (Earn While You Learn Program) Program by assigning your complete application to my Admission Officers, they will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities.

Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. would be mentioned. At the same time with the help of the SEELS Program, you would be given assignments and projects to earn scholarship credits so that you could start reducing your annual fee while you would be in their country itself.
19/12/23, 7:18 pm - Harmehak: I hope you understood the process till Step 5 properly now?
19/12/23, 7:21 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay yaah now I understand all the five steps.... So how do you conduct step two is it online or ..?
19/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Finally in Step 6: Once you receive your offer letter from the university where your *exact annual fee and scholarship percentage will be mentioned* and the universities will give you a few weeks time to make the payment of registration fee which will be adjusted in your tuition fee, in order to reserve your seat in that particular University chosen by you.
19/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: Basically, this registration fee ($500-$1000) will be waived off from your First Year's Fee and after that, *the remaining annual fee has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments*. The first part will be paid in August (2024-2025) and the remaining in January next year (2025-2026).
19/12/23, 7:22 pm - Harmehak: *After a few weeks when you pay the registration fee, you will be given your Admission Acceptance Letter, which is the most important document as it will help you in securing your visa.*

Here is a picture of the Visa of one of the Edoofian who arrived in India, for 2023 Academic Intake.

19/12/23, 7:23 pm - Harmehak: Here in the group itself,

Your different interview group would be created too.
19/12/23, 7:25 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Oooh okay I understand
19/12/23, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: I would now like to connect you with a particular parent. Mrs Ruth Magwaza is a single mother who happens to be a small-scale farmer in Mutare. She has her twins as part of the Edoofa program who are currently studying Sociology and Law in India. As a single parent, I feel she would be the right person to help you clarify how she has been assisted by the Edoofa scholarship program and how it was possible for her to cater towards the international education for both her children at the same time.

Have a look at her daughter's video as well.
19/12/23, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: Mrs. Ruth Magwaza.vcf (file attached)
19/12/23, 7:26 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
19/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yaaah this is nice I can see my video being shared to others for a better understanding 😂😂
19/12/23, 7:29 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay lemme connect with her
19/12/23, 7:31 pm - Harmehak: Well thats great, Denzel!
19/12/23, 7:32 pm - Harmehak: Surely, do request your mother to have a call with Mrs Ruth too!
19/12/23, 7:36 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay I'll connect them
19/12/23, 7:36 pm - Harmehak: Yes please!
19/12/23, 7:37 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay
19/12/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: And with this we come to the end of your counseling session, so before I guide you for the Step 2 that is the Eligibility Check.
19/12/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: Now, I want you to have a proper discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family-

*1. About the EDOOFA Program and it’s vision of making Education Affordable and Employment Ready*

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*

*3. Also, the financial aspect involved*

*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee and help you self sponsor if you are found eligible for the program*
19/12/23, 8:22 pm - Harmehak: To learn more about the type of students we look for, please go through these videos in which Edoofians from your country have shared their experiences.

20/12/23, 5:42 pm - Harmehak: Denzel, what did you brief you aunt so far?
20/12/23, 5:43 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Everything I know about the Edoofa scholarship program

So she is aware of the entire discussion along with your mother please?
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Yes ma'am
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: I understand what you are sharing, basically, my motive behind asking such a question was the fact that, as a counsellor, I have helped tens of thousands of students in the last 5 and a half years in Zimbabwe, and I do understand that financial stability in an economy like Zimbabwe is quite difficult these days. This is why I want to ask you if your child manages to pass the eligibility check stage, then you would have to complete payment of $350 towards the enrollment fee.

I feel in Zimbabwe, economic hardship has become a daily reality for parents as the country struggles with a fragile economy and high unemployment rate. In the past decade, Zimbabwe has seen hyperinflation, a collapse of the currency, a high poverty rate, and a rising cost of living. This has caused financial instability for many Zimbabwean families and made it increasingly difficult for parents to provide for their children. Parents are often forced to take on multiple jobs to make ends meet and many have had to cut back on basic necessities such as food, clothing, and education. Many parents have had to leave their children in the care of relatives or send them to live with friends in order to provide for them. This has put an enormous strain on the family unit as well as on the children who are not receiving the parental care and attention they need.
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Since Edoofa has been in existence for over 6 years in Africa and 14+ years as a Scholarship Program, It predominantly boasts a student community of 1500+ students. There have been instances where Students have applied to the program to see what happens next and their inquisitiveness without proper financial preparations and discussions with the family has led to consequences that are not a positive remark to the student's profile for tertiary education. The following were taken as remedial and disciplinary action by the board:-

1. The application was revoked and the student's scholarship seat was awarded to another student who as of the moment would be on the waiting list.

2. On the application of the student, disciplinary action was taken due to which the student gets barred for Three years from Edoofa Scholarship Program. 

Or 

A fee of $500 or the Program Fees from that round of admission, whichever is higher as applicable.
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Edoofa carries a repute because of the foster and cares it has provided to all students who are studying under the Program because of this the program has been recognized by various, government bodies, including the First Lady of Zimbabwe, the Ministry of Education and Zimbabwean High Commission in India

I will be attaching the pictures of our founder's meetings with them below.
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: <Media omitted>
20/12/23, 5:45 pm - Harmehak: Ideally as you know, the tentative dates:

1) If your child is found eligible, you can complete the payment of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 in 30 days, which means tentative deadlines would be around the 27th or 28 th December 2023 for $200 and the  27th or 28th of January for the remaining $150.

2) If your child is found eligible, the tentative deadline for the first financial commitment is the enrollment fee of $350, which would be around the 27th or 28th December 2023. 

Which one would you like to opt for, and are you financially prepared for the same?
20/12/23, 5:46 pm - Harmehak: Kindly go through the same,

Do discuss with your mother and your aunt and inform me once done please, Denzel.

Do connect Mrs Caroline with Mrs Ruth as well!
20/12/23, 5:51 pm - +263 71 315 9928: Okay maam
