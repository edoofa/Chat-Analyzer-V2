20/12/23, 10:35 pm - +263 71 888 1216: Hello Ms Harmehak

I am using my mother's phone right now 
Mine is off @263713320964

Anyways l am a young man
English and Shona are languages um comfortable using
I do not have a criminal record
I love learning about  new things...it keep me going ,knowing that they is more to the world than most people see it,and learning how things work
And for this reason that's why l would love to do engineering...it's a field filled will amaizing tech..etc.
Unlike most fields it's not limited
It goes beyond and even beyond our world and deeper into outer space

As for my Education
Right now l just finished writing A level and waiting for my results

But l won't lie 
My A level journey was not an easy one...
I was always behind..I had to work twice as much to keep up with others...
The combination l was doing was Maths 
Physics and Chem

And Maths was my best subject followed with Physics and lastly Chem..
I did find chemistry to be difficult for me because even if l read it, still l would fail to grasp the concepts and when l did grasp them the questions came in another format....
My weakness is l find it hard interacting with people very much...
It's as if l am an extrovert 


I do wish to study Engineering... l love it and they is no better way of making money than with what you love doing..

As for my hobbies l enjoy internet surfing and dancing


I don't come from a wealthy family...we do what we have to,to get by..
We are a family of 5 my me, mother, father and two siblings both girls

My mother is a stay at home mom
And my father works as a lab technician at a local company..

As for my siblings they are both still at school
One in high school the other in primary school
