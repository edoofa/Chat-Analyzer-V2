17/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: These Webinars gave an insight to our Edoofians about how their lives might look after their education is completed, and how they can turn any situation into an opportunity to excel and sit on the top in any field.

These are the reasons Edoofians are differentiated from other graduates/students from other universities and how the chances of getting employment increase.
17/10/23, 1:49 pm - Pallika Edoofa: *What are your views on the same? Do you think you will benefit from the Earn While You Learn Program?*
17/10/23, 5:28 pm - +263 71 496 3320: I think it's very good
17/10/23, 8:26 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Glad to know that, Milton

19/10/23, 9:16 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Milton,
I hope that you are doing well today.

I am here to begin our session, Shall we continue?
20/10/23, 8:02 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone, 

I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*
Let's have a discussion tonight. Shall we begin?
22/10/23, 1:44 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Hello
23/10/23, 8:52 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,
I hope that you are doing well today.

I am here to begin the session, Shall we begin?
23/10/23, 1:37 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Alright
23/10/23, 1:54 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Milton, Continuing our discussion, Let me tell you If I have to help you explain, how the Earn While You Learn Program helps a student make higher education affordable and comparable to Local Universities. Let us take an example wherein we assume the annual fee to be $2200 a year. Now if you manage to earn scholarship credits worth $100 in a month, this means that you can earn $1200 in a year, and that would basically bring the cost further down to $1000 per year which includes the cost of tuition, food and accommodation, which means for the family monthly cost of the student’s education would be somewhere between $90-$100 a month.


*NOTE:- This does not mean that there is any limit up to which a student can earn scholarship credits. In short, as much as a student is willing to work hard to sponsor his higher education, he/she can earn accordingly*.
23/10/23, 6:06 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I was hoping for a response, Let us connect at *08:30 am CAT (25/10/2023)* to resume your session,


 Also, I understand that not everyone can join our morning sessions due to various commitments. *To ensure that I can assist all of you, I will be available for a night session.*
Let's have a discussion at night in case you are unavailable in the morning session on 25/10/2023. Your success is our top priority, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. *Usually, my working hours are over by now, but I'm extending them to accommodate your needs.*

Please let me know your convenient time.

Stay Blessed!

26/10/23, 4:43 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Continuing our discussion, Milton, Now let me brief you about the facts where Edoofa stands out to is different from other scholarship programs, A few facts that you must have noticed during our counseling:
1. *Expert Career Counseling*: We believe no student should be denied access to the right information at the right time in their career planning because we know its value. Therefore, we ensure that the most caring, experienced, and empathetic career counselors help our students with direct and actionable advice for career growth.

2. *Affordability through guaranteed scholarships*: Through acceptance in the Edoofa program, a candidate is guaranteed a minimum scholarship of 50-100% of their tuition fee. Here students save up to $1000-$1500 in application fees while applying to various Edoofa campuses is completely waived off

3. *Earn While You Learn*: The most valuable learning comes from doing. Learning for the sake of learning is wonderful, but the Internet now makes most information accessible. Instead, Edoofa focuses on preparing you for the real world. What's more, students earn

*4.*Higher Education Concierge*: A Concierge is a caretaker. We undertake all major responsibilities of guiding our students throughout their journey of higher education with us - *Right from Career selection, Course and College identification, Application form filling, Visa and fee payment assistance, travel guidance, training, and internships. Edoofa stays with the students throughout their journey of Higher Education*.

After going through the facts that make Edoofa different, 
Let me know which point out of the 4  you like the most.
26/10/23, 7:15 pm - +263 71 496 3320: I like point 3 which goes by earn while you learn as it enables self sufficiency
26/10/23, 7:15 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Great! 
So now I know you focus more on  *Earn While You Learn*

Let me also show you some monthly earnings of students through Earn While You Learn.

30/10/23, 7:42 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Actually my parents
30/10/23, 7:42 pm - Pallika Edoofa: That's completely understandable,
So, I believe you'll be discussing everything with them after we complete today's session. Also after our counseling session, I would connect to some of our Beneficiaries from your country so you'll get to know the proceedings well.

So may I know how your family feels about you studying abroad?
30/10/23, 7:43 pm - +263 71 496 3320: It's amazing
30/10/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I am glad to hear that, as studying Internationally would make your career advance at an even greater pace, as you will be transformed into a professional with a Greater Paying Job, which would actually help you in uplifting your family there by yourself, and provide a peaceful and hassle-free life to your parents.
30/10/23, 7:44 pm - Pallika Edoofa: So can you tell me what is required when a student plans to apply for a university abroad? According to me, it would be 

1) *Application Form*

2) *Statement of Purpose* which is an essay that's one of the most important aspects of your application because it tells the admission committee who you are, why you're applying, and why you're a good candidate, in the context of applying for graduate school and what you want to do in the future.

3) *Letter of Recommendation* from senior authorities on why they recommend you to an international university

Isn't it?
30/10/23, 7:45 pm - +263 71 496 3320: All the above
30/10/23, 7:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Indeed
When a student applies alone for an international University, on average the application fee of a University is *$150-$200*. Statement of Purpose of the students costs between *$120-$150* respectively, simply because these are to be drafted professionally as on their basis itself, the University decides whether they would like to go through the student’s application or they would straightaway reject it.

Now this basically means, that for a student to apply to just *5 Universities the average cost* incurred by him/her would be somewhere between *$1350-1750* *(Application Form + Statement of Purpose) without* even receiving a guarantee to be selected for not
30/10/23, 7:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Do you know this is one reason that Edoofa has identified, where students use their investments with no assurance of what would happen, just like other issues, we have found the solution to this problem as well.

So as the students are found eligible and enroll in the program not only does Edoofa help them create *the statement of purpose but also helps you with the Visa Documentation Assistance, University Selection, sessions, Seels Learning Center (SLC) classes, etc* All these facilities would cost you more than *$1350-$1750* without Edoofa but because of our vision, you can access all these important facilities for your education abroad for only *$750*. *This $750 is the Edoofa Program(enrollment) fee.*
30/10/23, 7:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
30/10/23, 7:46 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope you understand now. So, Shall I explain to you when and why the enrollment fee is paid?
30/10/23, 8:48 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Yes
30/10/23, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: This enrollment fee is to be paid only if a student qualifies for the Edoofa program and includes your
*-Application Forms to multiple Universities prepared by our Academic Team*
*-Statement of Purpose for Multiple Universities*
*-Earn While You Learn Program and training*
*-University sessions and interactions*
*-A guaranteed scholarship seat*
*-Visa Documentation Assistance*
*The Foster and Care throughout your course* <This message was edited>
30/10/23, 8:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: However, we do know that in most African Nations, economic instability is a major challenge because a student might face a challenge in completing their entire fee in a short time span of 7 days, therefore for such instances, parents are provided with flexible fee payment option as well, wherein if the student is *found eligible then instead of paying the entire fee in 7 days, parents can complete a part fee of $200 in 7 days and the remaining $150 within next 30 days.*

31/10/23, 12:52 pm - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings,

I am here to begin the session,

Shall we begin the session?
31/10/23, 3:31 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Yes we can
31/10/23, 4:01 pm - Pallika Edoofa: I hope that you are doing well today.
31/10/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: As we have discussed this, Basically, there are 3 phases of the enrollment process.


*Phase 1*: Counseling session with the Students/Parents and Seat Reservation
If the student is found competent for the program and receives their Reservation Letter, you will have to pay only a part of the Program Fee which is $350 within 7 days from the receipt of your Edoofa Reservation Letter which basically is for the seat reservation and the Earn While You Learn Program.


*Phase 2*: Once the students complete Phase 1 they will be starting their Earn While you Learn program classes (Each student will have an opportunity to earn credits that can be used to reduce the fee before their A-level result is out).


*Phase 3*: Once the final A-level results are out if the student has passed the necessary requirements as per Edoofa then their final University evaluation and Admission will be continued. However, if the student doesn't meet the necessary requirements as per the University and Edoofa, then the $350 would be refunded to the parents.


*The amount of credit earned by the students during Phase 2 can be used for the student's first year's annual fee as well so that parents do not end up being burdened at the last moment.*

31/10/23, 9:51 pm - +263 71 496 3320: Well understood
01/11/23, 8:09 am - +263 71 496 3320: Hello
01/11/23, 9:02 am - Pallika Edoofa: Greetings Everyone!

I hope that you all are doing well, Kindly excuse me for the delay as my laptop was updating, 

Are you ready for the session?
01/11/23, 9:22 am - +263 71 496 3320: Yes am ready
01/11/23, 9:23 am - Pallika Edoofa: Good to hear that
01/11/23, 9:24 am - +263 71 496 3320: Really
01/11/23, 9:24 am - Pallika Edoofa: <Media omitted>
01/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 496 3320: Okay
01/11/23, 9:26 am - +263 71 496 3320: I think we are inStage 4
01/11/23, 9:27 am - Pallika Edoofa: Well, Milton, 
We are at stage one but have also discussed the Acceptance Letter that a student receives if found eligible for the program and the procedures of enrollment which are stage 4.

*In Step 1: Connect with a counselor*- As your counselor, we are going through the counseling process, discussing the program and eligibility process for the $10 million Merit-based Scholarship.                        

*In Step 2: Eligibility Check*- The eligibility check includes the interviews with the Academic Board and the Test.

*Step 3. Acceptance Letter from Edoofa*- If a student manages to clear the interview process, then he/she gets selected for the Edoofa Scholarship program and receives the Acceptance Letter!

*Step 4. Enrollment into the Edoofa Program*- This step involves finalizing the enrollment into the Edoofa program by completing the Enrollment Fee Formalities.


We are left with 5 and 6.
So shall I explain it to you?
01/11/23, 9:29 am - +263 71 496 3320: Indeed you can elaborate more
01/11/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 5:* After the enrollment, we will start your Admission Process for your higher education and the Earn While You Learn(EWYL) Program by assigning your complete application to the Admission Officers and EWYL mentors, They will first prepare your Statement of Purpose and then send it to our Partner Universities. Once we receive responses from the Universities, you will be given an Offer Letter from the Universities, where your scholarship, fees, etc. will be mentioned. After receiving letters, our dedicated Admission Officers will share their recommendation for the preferred university for you and then you will be asked to discuss the same with your family and sponsors and decide on which university you would like to join. Once you finalize that, you will have to reserve your seat by paying the registration fee within a few weeks.
01/11/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: This registration fee($500-$1000) isn’t an additional amount as it will be waived off from your First year’s Fee thereby making it a part of the cost of education itself and after that, the remaining has to be paid after coming to India in 2 installments. (The first part will be paid in August 2024 and the remaining in January 2025).
01/11/23, 9:30 am - Pallika Edoofa: *Step 6:* Once you are done with the registration fee payment, you will be able to apply for the visa. To help you with the Visa application and processes, we have our dedicated Visa Assistance Team who will guide you through the process of securing your visa till you arrive here in India.
 
I hope you are clear with the process.
01/11/23, 9:31 am - +263 71 496 3320: Crystal clear
01/11/23, 9:45 am - Pallika Edoofa: Alright, Milton, we have come to the end of your counseling session, now Before I guide you *Step 2 is the Eligibility Check.*
 
I want you to have a full-fledged discussion about the same with all your family members as higher education is supposed to be a family decision which is why I want you to discuss the following aspects with your family -

*2. Value of your career after studying the desired course in India*
*3. Also, the financial aspects involved*
*4. How Edoofa would help you arrange your fee if you are found eligible for the program*

How have you been?
10/11/23, 10:50 am - Austin: Dear parents, @263785370091 @27604400425 , are you clear with the reasons for opening the 2024 and 2025 intakes?
Let me know if you have any questions regarding the same
10/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 537 0091: Milton is looking for university next year, lastly u were talking of upper six
10/11/23, 1:29 pm - Austin: Absolutely, the intakes of both 2024&2025 are open now, which means upper six students are enrolling and beginning the Earn While You Learn Program
10/11/23, 1:33 pm - +263 78 537 0091: How do they register,? Do u have offices in Zim?
10/11/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: We have already received the application for Milton due to which these sessions have been hosted
10/11/23, 1:41 pm - Austin: Please note that we don't have an office in Zimbabwe since it would be challenging to set up an office in the 29+ countries from which we receive applications. The nearest office to you would be in Kitwe, Zambia. If you have known people in Zambia, I can guide you to visit our office. We have visits to Zimbabwe every year to prepare our Edoofians for their intake. Moreover , we have our associates in Zimbabwe

We understand that students have been occupied with lessons and academic commitments in the previous months due to which have been unable to actively participate in the sessions or adhere to the application process. Since the learners are back from vacation, we have been experiencing a surge in the number of applications but have decided to offer a final chance to the previous applicants before we revoke their applications. *So do you wish to continue with the Edoofa Scholarship Program?*

06/12/23, 4:03 pm - Pallika Edoofa: @263785370091 If we begin the eligibility check stage of Milton today, it would be of 1-2 days after which his results will be out which means if s Scholarship, the due date for the first part of the enrollment fee ($200)will fall in the behind of the next week of December. Are you comfortable with the timeframe?
