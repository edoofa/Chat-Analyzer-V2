I trust you're well. 

To streamline admission and scholarship preparations, it's vital that every student participates in these initial sessions covering the session outline, credits, and projects. Delaying these sessions could potentially put your child at a disadvantage🔙

I empathize with your upcoming exams and your dedication to excelling. In support of your academic endeavors, I'm ready to extend my working hours to ensure your child doesn't miss out on any essential guidance. Your child's success is our priority🙏🏻
16/09/23, 10:10 am - Saloni Edoofa: If you are not available as a student, _*your parents can complete these initial sessions, and we can expedite the process within three days*_.

11/10/23, 10:08 am - Saloni Edoofa: For the most part of the EWYL journey, the students would work on three major projects to learn & earn as many scholarship credits as they can and for that, I would like you to read the following document, which I am just about to share with you. Take some time, read the document in detail, and get back to me. This document describes a few of the most rewarding projects that Panashe will be a part of. Let me know once you have gone through the same.

11/10/23, 10:08 am - +263 77 838 1077: the big problem is that neither Panashe nor myself we are both low, as a parent l was suspended at work so its now difficult to continue since the source of income has been jeopardised and lam looking forward to have other source but l dnt think it will come out soon, to Panashe he is disappointed and l thnk he feels neglected to continue with the session yet he is aware of the situation here, l dnt know how best can l sail through this problem,.
11/10/23, 10:13 am - Saloni Edoofa: Well, I completely understand that at first managing financing in this situation when you don't have any fixed flow can be very overwhelming as well as worrisome, but trust me, things will fall in place.

11/10/23, 10:31 am - +263 77 838 1077: yes they are aware of this situation and l dnt know what best can we do as a parent am really out of what to do.
11/10/23, 10:33 am - +263 77 838 1077: Panashe now is focusing on his exams and the moment he saw that something has happened to me his moral was low and l think he is not in his good mood l think this will also contribute to his results which are just in progress now.
11/10/23, 10:36 am - +263 77 838 1077: Is there any other help l can to secure   his admission to the UZ but at the same time if he is in l wont see muself managing in due course of which it will disadvantages him again in his career

07/12/23, 10:55 am - +263 78 187 7854: The thing is after one has send his/her documents I just ask him / her if she is okay by sharing his/her schoolmates and loved ones who might benefit from the program, after they share I then go into one’s inbox and chat with him/her telling him/her about Edoofa if one finds it interesting they share their documents as well. And the circle continues that  way.
07/12/23, 10:56 am - Saloni Edoofa: There is a trick on how you can excel and increase the number of participants in the group:

1. Give only admin access in the group and share messages in the group that can direct them to your inbox where you can share the information about Edoofa.
Similar to the screenshot that I am sharing with you.
