I want to be accepted into the Edoofa Program because that I have passed my Alevel so I want to go to University to learn on Business management but the problem in hand is my parents do not have enough money for me to go to University they are all unemployed

*I am Ms Tushti, Career Counsellor at Edoofa.*

We have received an application for the Edoofa Scholarship Program.

I hope I have contacted the right person.

I would like you to come online *tomorrow at 9:30 am* so that I could discuss with you the form you submitted online and what I was able to understand from the same!

Please note that you shall be required to add your parent to this group tomorrow, and their participation is mandatory.
