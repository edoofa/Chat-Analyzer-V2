07/08/23, 4:11 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon, Winnie!

I am thrilled to introduce myself as Ms. Ananya, your mentor for the EWYL program. Together, we will work hard and aim for the sky to earn maximum scholarship credits from this program.

So, are you ready to join me on this exciting journey? Let's work hard and reach for the stars!🌟
07/08/23, 4:14 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Greetings Ms Ananya, nice to know you....
07/08/23, 4:14 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wonderful, my student! So, to kick things off with a bang, I wanted to share a fantastic video with you that I think will help us connect on a deeper level. Get ready to be inspired!
07/08/23, 4:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
07/08/23, 4:15 pm - +263 71 260 6194: That's great.. Let's go...
07/08/23, 4:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I've got some amazing news for you! We've gone ahead and scheduled your sessions from Monday to Friday, starting at 2:00 PM and running until 3:00 PM. And let me tell you, I just know you're going to blow us away with your incredible energy and enthusiasm every single day!
08/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Thank you
08/08/23, 2:27 pm - +263 71 260 6194: You can clarify the objectives
08/08/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, so  the *first goal* is to ensure that all Edoofians have an *equal opportunity* to develop 21st-century skills, which will ensure that they are equipped for the employment market once they have acquired their final degrees and are ready to begin their professional careers. We follow a *systematic program/curriculum* in which each session and discussion will be focused on developing your skillset and ensuring you are prepared to fulfill all of the skill criteria of employers and reach your professional goals.
08/08/23, 2:27 pm - Ananya Edoofa: The *second goal* is to help all our edoofians *self-finance their education*, yes, most of our students have the aim of helping their parents in paying off their fees, and we encourage them to work hard and make sure that they earn the maximum amount of credits and pay their tuition fees. I would like to reiterate that, scholarship credits are not physical money rather they will be directly paid into the university account and will reduce the balance of your tuition fees.
08/08/23, 2:28 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Understood!!
08/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Let me share with you that Mihlayonke one of my students has _earned more than 800 USD_ and has paid some part of his tuition fees. Why don't you read how he did that, he wrote an email to the team expressing his gratitude. Here is the screenshot of the same, let me know once you have read the same.
08/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 2:29 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Ok.. Let me
08/08/23, 2:30 pm - +263 71 260 6194: This is amazing
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Before we proceed, my Father has joined the wrong group due to the mix up that happened yesterday, so i am dropping his number please kindly add him to the group
08/08/23, 2:32 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Papa Bear.vcf (file attached)
08/08/23, 2:33 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I have shared the link with him to make it easier
08/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: That's great!
08/08/23, 2:40 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, let me introduce you to the *EWYL team*. 
*Ms. Deepali* is the *Head of the Department* and all group conversations will be monitored whenever we need her guidance, she will be there. She is always known for her genuine concern for students. 

We also have *Ms. Davi*, *Head coach* is with us and will be mentoring us through her content and structured curriculum. You will hear from her every week. 
Both Ms. Deepali and Ms. Davi will ensure that you achieve the desired skillset through the EWYL course and they will evaluate all your efforts.
08/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 260 6194: That's good to hear
08/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Here is another great food for thought, along with our lessons and activities, we have our weekly *newsletters* as well. A newsletter is a direct source where the founder, *Mr. Angad Singh* connects with all of our Edoofians- this is a strong medium to learn from him, his experience, and his wisdom. You will be receiving an email every weekend along with a PDF of the same. Trust me, this is a great chance to learn from the best. Once you form a habit of reading the newsletter religiously, you would also be eagerly waiting for the next, like all other students are experiencing right now. For your better understanding let me share a few of our previous newsletters with you. Kindly go through them and let me know once you have read them, I guess 20 minutes should be enough.
08/08/23, 2:42 pm - Ananya Edoofa: <Media omitted>
08/08/23, 2:43 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Ok... Thank you

3. Above all, work towards attaining the objective - that you are learning and evolving with the relevant 21st-century skills to prepare you for the real-world workplace and help you grow holistically!
How does that sound, Winnie?
09/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Sound great
09/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I enjoyed our conversation, I am certain, you would have a better understanding of what your EWYL journey is going to look like, full of knowledge and opportunities to grow and develop yourself. This will be all for today, let us connect tomorrow as I have more in store for you. I would like to focus tomorrow's discussion on making you familiar with our schedule once again and also share what is expected from a dedicated Edoofian. Before we end our discussion for the day, I would like to ask you a few questions to understand how much from today’s discussion you could retain and if there is anything for us to discuss again.
09/08/23, 2:13 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Are you ready for the questions?*
09/08/23, 2:14 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I am ready

willing to extend their help in the overall development of all the students that enrol for 
the EDOOFA programme. To make sure that one looks for the right type of companies, 
one must keep into consideration the following factors:

Some factors also have to be put into consideration as per the guidelines and these include searching for the company, studying more about the company via Google, studying the website of the company, checking various social media pages of the company, checking and understanding the background of the founder as well as company members then lastly checking and understanding background of people associated with the company

18/08/23, 2:42 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Ok, noted
18/08/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: While reaching out to students, share this message with the student and make sure they are aware of this since the counselor would be cross-verifying with the student about,
 1. Who referred Edoofa to them, so that only you get the scholarship credits if the student gets enrolled
2. And secondly, to see whether they know about Edoofa well or not
In case the student is not aware of these two points, scholarship credits will not be given to you.
18/08/23, 2:44 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Hello Friends
I am _______ a student selected for the prestigious *Edoofa Scholarship Program* to pursue my tertiary education in India. I always wanted to Study abroad after the recent fee hike at the Universities in Zimbabwe where the tuition is ZWL 450000-ZWL 550000 per term, when calculating the yearly cost including Food and Accommodation it was more than $1700 in ZIM. Talking to seniors, I realized that I may have to compromise for the course because of limited seats. Moreover, many seniors are unemployed after graduation in Zimbabwe. 
I wanted to support my family through partial employment during the course and this is when I heard about the *Earn While You Learn Program at EDOOFA* which gives opportunities to Earn *$50-$100 per month throughout the course.*

You can complete your tertiary education in India at costs less than the Universities in Zimbabwe however it is not that easy. I followed the *5’S which helped me to qualify for this Scholarship*.  Make sure you go through the Five Pointers with utmost sincerity. The counselors ask you questions from the flyer I have attached. 
Fill out the Offline Form of EDOOFA after completing the 5’S of Edoofa.
Best of Luck!

Edoofa believes quality education should be accessible to all and not just the privilege of a few. Through our scholarship program that is based on a work-study model, Edoofa solves both problems, that of *lack of affordability and of employability in higher education.* Edoofa stays with the students throughout their academic life as mentor and caretaker, right from building the application, applying to colleges, training, and making them job-ready. This is an experience that I acknowledge as being a Proud Edoofian!🎉

31/08/23, 2:13 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Thank you
31/08/23, 2:15 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Now, Winnie we’ve come to the end of one part of your onboarding of EWYL. So, I want you to go through this conversation quickly- and highlight any areas, questions, or projects that you may have even the slightest concern with- and let’s resolve them before we move on!
31/08/23, 2:21 pm - +263 71 260 6194: So far i have understood everything as it is explained, thank you
31/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: It’s amazing to be your partner in this EWYL journey. Till now, we’ve spoken to each other about our goals for this year, the promise of earning and learning well through this program, we went over 3 of the projects specially curated for Edoofians to get started with earning scholarship credits and their journey of learning relevant skills like communication, networking, and leadership to name a few.
31/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: However, there are a few more skills that the entire EWYL team and myself believe can add immense value to your holistic growth and give you an additional opportunity to earn, while simultaneously interacting with live projects!
31/08/23, 2:23 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *So, are you excited to find out what this is?*
31/08/23, 2:25 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Very excited indeed...
31/08/23, 2:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Edoofa took it upon itself to have Edoofians interact with Live and Real-time projects. This was only possible when we onboarded our future employment partners to give us access to projects for our students!
 Now, as I was mentioning, TEAM EWYL and I want you to learn the skills necessary for the digital workspace environment- which namely included research, content writing, SEO, digital marketing, creative content, influencer marketing, social media engagement, blog writing – just to name a few.
31/08/23, 2:31 pm - +263 71 260 6194: That's great
31/08/23, 2:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *SEO* - Search engine optimization is the process of improving the quality and quantity of website traffic to a website or a web page from search engines. SEO targets unpaid traffic rather than direct traffic or paid traffic.

*Influencer marketing* - Influencer marketing is a form of social media marketing involving endorsements and product placement from influencers, people, and organizations who have a purported expert level of knowledge or social influence in their field.

*Blog writing*- Blogging refers to writing, photography, and other media that are self-published online. Blogging started as an opportunity for individuals to write diary-style entries, but it has since been incorporated into websites for many businesses.
31/08/23, 2:55 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Are we connected, Winnie?
31/08/23, 2:57 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Yes
31/08/23, 2:57 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So, Winnie, since I have your full focus, I’ll share with you how you can also become a part of these projects offered by Edoofa! There are 3 easy steps to bagging a Project-
1. Give your best in your projects that have been discussed and perform well by earning scholarship credits
2. Do not miss your EWYL sessions without informing your mentors or unless it’s an emergency
3. Ask for support, share your challenges and the things you’re good at, like social media, content writing, communication, etc, and make your mentor trust you fully
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - +263 71 260 6194: Understood
31/08/23, 2:58 pm - Ananya Edoofa: There are a few additional things that are required for you to be selected for a project. I want you to share the following with me
1. Instagram Username
2. Facebook Username
3. A smiling photo of yours ✨ 
→ IN case you do not have an Instagram/Facebook account- I want you to create one, and then send it in the next 24-36 hours.
31/08/23, 2:59 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I do not have an Instagram account as well as a Facebook account... I am sure by tomorrow i can send the required information
31/08/23, 3:00 pm - +263 71 260 6194: <Media omitted>
31/08/23, 3:01 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Wow, Winnie I really liked your hair.
31/08/23, 3:02 pm - +263 71 260 6194: I will take that as a compliment... Thank you very much 😁
31/08/23, 3:04 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You are most welcome!
31/08/23, 3:05 pm - Ananya Edoofa: So now we are ready to begin our new journey.

Please ensure that you connect with me on the EWYL Line everyday by saying  'I am a Proud Edoofian'.

It is essential to say this daily as it connects all students, counselors, mentors, and parents associated with Edoofa. Without this, we will not be able to conduct our sessions and may fall behind in terms of earning credits.

"I am a Proud Edoofian" will be considered as your attendance, and we will commence the session only when we receive this message from you.
31/08/23, 3:07 pm - Ananya Edoofa: FOURTH: I want you to drop a message on this EWYL line:

I want to inform you that we won't be having our session today because today is a national holiday in India. We are celebrating Mahatma Gandhi's birthday. Mahatma Gandhi, often called the "Father of the Nation," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through nonviolent civil disobedience. His dedication to truth, nonviolence, and social justice inspires people worldwide.

It's a special day when we remember his life and the significant impact his deeds had on our nation's freedom movement.🇮🇳

I hope all is well with you. I noticed you didn't follow your EWYL Ritual of saying the proud Edoofian on your EWYL Line this time. Due to this, I couldn't share your weekly activity with you, and this might impact your performance in the EWYL program. Therefore, I'm reminding you to include the ritual in your message when you can. This way, I can share our weekly activity with you!
29/10/23, 5:21 pm - +263 77 369 1078: I'm sorry Winie had serious challenges with her phone and she can't download any whatsaap on her gadget. I hope she will be able to get assistance from Huawei after the weekend.

30/10/23, 3:38 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Alright, thank you for informing me.
06/11/23, 12:24 pm - Ananya Edoofa: *Session time has started*

Your session time has already started, and I am waiting for you on your EWYL line. Kindly join!
06/11/23, 1:49 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Good afternoon Ms Ananya. Sorry for failing to notify. Winnie has gone to the rural home to work in the fields as the rain season is setting on. She will be back to town on the 16th of November. Until she comes back to town there is no network at his rural home. Therefore she is out of reach until 16th. I'm sure you understand poor families in Zimbabwe survive by hustling.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: I want you inform you that I'll be away from 10th Oct to 13th Oct, immersed in the vibrant celebrations of Diwali, the festival of lights and triumph of good over evil. Diwali is a time for family, friends, and the warm glow of diyas (traditional lamps). 🪔✨

During this festive break, I won't be available, but fear not! We can catch up on Thursday at 9:30 a.m. once the echoes of fireworks settle down.
09/11/23, 12:16 pm - Ananya Edoofa: You know, Diwali is all about celebrating the triumph of light over darkness and good over evil. It's a time when homes are adorned with vibrant decorations, and the air is filled with the sweet scent of festivities.

Now, here's where it gets exciting—I'd love for you to join in on the cultural blend! Imagine this as a global celebration, bringing together the spirit of Diwali with a touch of your own uniqueness. Embrace the lights, colors, and positive vibes that Diwali brings.

Here's a little something for you: Light a candle, even if it's just one, and let it be a symbol of the light that shines within you. Capture the moment by snapping a photo of your candlelit celebration. Share that photograph with me—it's a wonderful way for us to connect across cultures and celebrate the diversity that makes our mentorship journey so special.

Looking forward to witnessing your Diwali celebration, even from afar! 🪔✨ If you have any questions about the festival or just want to share your experience, feel free to drop a message.

Wishing you a Diwali filled with joy, light, and memorable moments! 🎉

15/11/23, 8:12 am - Ananya Edoofa: Greetings, Winnie!

I hope this message finds you well. Due to some urgent work that requires my attention tomorrow, I will be taking a day off. In light of this, I have decided to reschedule our session originally planned for tomorrow.

The rescheduled session will take place today at 12 PM. I look forward to seeing each of you at the rescheduled time.
15/11/23, 8:22 am - +263 77 369 1078: Greetings Mrs Ananya Winie is likely to travel back from her remote rural home today. So please when she is back she will alert you and you schedule your sessions
15/11/23, 8:52 am - Ananya Edoofa: Alright. @263773691078 

Thank you for informing me.
20/12/23, 1:28 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Good afternoon,@263773691078 

I hope you are doing well. I have observed that you have not been attending your EWYL sessions lately, and it hurts a lot to see that a dedicated student like becoming inconsistent with the sessions. I am sure that when you signed up for the EWYL program, you had aspirations for your life, including plans for earning and financing your education. I am confident that you still want to pursue those goals, right?

Well, I'm here and ready to help you on this journey. It's crucial to attend the sessions and work hard to earn the credits. Don't you think it's not justified to rely solely on your parents' money when you have opportunities to make the most of the resources available to you? Well, I think it's not, and therefore, I want you to make your parents proud and be independent.

As your mentor, I want to understand if you are facing any challenges while attending the sessions. Please tell me if you require any adjustments to your sessions. If you do not share this with me, how can I help you overcome these challenges?
20/12/23, 3:49 pm - +263 77 369 1078: Good afternoon Mentor.
I am not a student but a parent to Winnie. I will check with her if she is attending her sessions.
20/12/23, 4:51 pm - Ananya Edoofa: Kindly excuse me, since there was only your contact number, so I tagged that number. She has not been attending her sessions for quite a long time now, and I would really appreciate it if you could connect with her after reading this.
