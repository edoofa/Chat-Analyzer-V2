15/11/23, 8:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to know that you are clear about the purpose of the two WhatsApp groups and it's reassuring to hear this from your end. I also had a recent conversation with your counselor, during which he provided me with some insights into your academic background and career aspirations. I must commend you as a family, you must take great pride in your achievements and be dedicated to ensuring your access to the finest opportunities to launch your career.

Speaking of valuable opportunities, I am also curious to learn more about your counseling session with your counselor and to understand which aspects of the Edoofa Scholarship Program have particularly impressed you thus far. Can you share this with me?
15/11/23, 9:07 pm - +263 78 867 1027: For my counseling session with Ms Tushti everything was  laid down for me the question and the answers, everything was just interesting because she explained a lot to me about Edoofa and also explained to me on how to make the payments. It was interesting because I understood everything from my counselor
15/11/23, 9:11 pm - +263 78 867 1027: She also gave me the advice pertaining the course that I chose
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: That sounds like a comprehensive and helpful session. I'm glad that Ms. Tushti was able to provide such detailed information about Edoofa and assist you in understanding the payment process and the course you've chosen. It's crucial to have a clear understanding of these aspects as they significantly impact your educational journey.
15/11/23, 9:20 pm - Milan Edoofa: Moving forward with the procedures, I would like to share an insight with you. To ensure a seamless experience, we as a team, have prepared essential documents that not only value your feedback but also outline the Earn While You Learn (EWYL) Program and the application process. You will have to review, complete, and submit these documents as instructed. 

If you are ready, shall I share a brief overview of these documents for your ease?
15/11/23, 9:25 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm ready
15/11/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: Perfect! Let's delve into the documents that are crucial for your journey with Edoofa.

*1. Feedback Form:* Your candid feedback is invaluable in our pursuit of excellence. This form offers you the chance to voice your opinions and suggestions.

Once completed, you can scan the document or click a picture and share it with us here in your admission group.

15/11/23, 9:35 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
15/11/23, 10:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the hour grows late on my end, I'm afraid I have limited time available today. Therefore, I regretfully must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's plan to reconnect tomorrow starting from 1:00 PM onwards to continue our discussion. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
16/11/23, 7:36 am - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 7:44 am - +263 78 867 1027: Okok sir
16/11/23, 1:15 pm - Milan Edoofa: Good Afternoon Rumbidzai and Esteemed Family,
I hope this message finds you well today. 

I trust that the intervening period has been productive and filled with positivity on your end.

As we resume our conversation from yesterday, I am eager to guide you through the next steps in your admission journey. Before we proceed, if I may ask are you ready for today's session? <This message was edited>
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Good afternoon Mr Milan how are you doing today
16/11/23, 1:18 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm ready for the session
16/11/23, 1:54 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, I have gone through the form that you have filled and shared here with me, and I can see that you have not attached your picture there as well as you have written NO in your answer to question number 6.A, can you please let me know of the reason behind that dear?
16/11/23, 2:00 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ms Tushti did mention to me about the money to be paid including the accommodation, food and tuition fee but it was written on the Acceptance letter so I'm not sure of the amount of money to be paid
16/11/23, 2:01 pm - +263 78 867 1027: So my question is, the amount of money to be paid after receiving a scholarship percentage will range from 2000-3000 including tuition fee, food and accommodation?
16/11/23, 2:07 pm - Milan Edoofa: Thank you for highlighting that, Rumbidzai. Your concern about the mentioned amount in the acceptance letter is valid. Allow me to clarify the financial aspect of the Edoofa scholarship program.
16/11/23, 2:08 pm - Milan Edoofa: The scholarship you've been awarded is a scholarship that covers a specific percentage of your tuition fee i.e. from 50-100%. Additionally, the mentioned amount in the acceptance letter includes an estimated calculation for accommodation and food expenses. 

Upon receiving the scholarship percentage, the remaining amount you're responsible for will indeed range approximately between 2000 to 3000, covering expenses related to accommodation, food, and remaining tuition fee after the scholarship deduction. This estimation provides a rough idea; the exact amount can be discussed and finalized once you've received your scholarship offer and decided on the university. I hope this is understood now?
16/11/23, 2:09 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes this is clear thank you sir
16/11/23, 2:13 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is good to know please. Now, on that note, I would like you to correct your feedback form and then share it with me here again. Till then, shall we move ahead?
16/11/23, 3:15 pm - +263 78 867 1027: <Media omitted>
16/11/23, 4:11 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Sir when I wrote my A level examination ZIMSEC we started in November 2020 and finished January 2021 so which is the year that I'm supposed to fill in the counseling feedback form
16/11/23, 5:45 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We did not manage to finish the exams in 2020 due to Corona virus so should I use 2020 or 2021
16/11/23, 7:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: On that note, you can fill in 2021 please.
16/11/23, 10:26 pm - Milan Edoofa: As the time draws closer to evening on my end, I regret to inform you that I have limited availability remaining for today. Hence, I must conclude our conversation for now.

Let's aim to reconnect tomorrow, starting from 1:00 PM onwards, to continue our discussion. I hope this arrangement suits your schedule. Wishing you a peaceful and pleasant evening ahead. Please convey my warm regards to your esteemed family as well.
17/11/23, 1:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: As per our previous conversation, I am reaching out to continue our discussion regarding your university admission journey. I trust that you've had a productive day so far.

Moving forward in our today’s session, we will discuss a bit about your university admission journey. For that, I will be sharing an image with you in which the complete admission process is divided into 6 parts, I will explain to you it in a step-by-step process, and during the whole discussion, if you have any queries or doubts, please feel free to ask and clarify them.

If you are ready, shall we start with our discussion?
20/11/23, 1:17 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes let's start
20/11/23, 1:21 pm - Milan Edoofa: <Media omitted>
20/11/23, 1:23 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I'm done we can proceed
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Let me explain all the steps to you one by one -

*Step 1: Message from the founder’s office* - An explicitly designed series of videos for the students to have more clarity on being an Edoofian, what are the qualities of being an Edoofian, aligning with Edoofa’s vision, getting to know the schools, colleges, and universities under the EDOOFA Program, as well as the importance of the Statement of Purpose.
20/11/23, 1:24 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 2: Statement of Purpose* - The SOP is the only subjective document that allows you to convince the admission board or any school of why you are worthy of scholarship or admission in school and it includes your solid achievements, your unique traits, your abilities, and also your goals, your vision, your academic progress, why you’ve chosen that particular course and why you’re seeking admission in that particular school.

I hope these two steps are clear.
20/11/23, 1:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please let's proceed to the next steps
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is wonderful to know. Allow me to proceed to the next two steps- 

*Step 3: Counseling session on school selection and achieving maximum scholarship* - The Academic Board of Edoofa shares their recommendations and insights from their 15+ years of experience on how to achieve success in life, selection of universities, and achieving maximum scholarship along with other things. This counseling session will take about 1 hour.
20/11/23, 1:31 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 4: Offer Letters from the University* - Based on Edoofa’s recommendations, your academic documents, and the SOP, the Admissions Team would send your application to multiple universities for evaluation and admission process and based on that, the Offer Letter would be issued.

I hope you are following?
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes  I understand that
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am pleased to hear that. Now continuing with the last two steps -

*Step 5: Registration and Admission Acceptance Letter* - Once you receive your Letter of Intent, you have to register and reserve your seat with the university by paying the registration fee of $500 to $1000. Furthermore, after you pay the same and for you to have a smooth Visa process the university issues the Admission Acceptance letter (AAL).
20/11/23, 1:34 pm - Milan Edoofa: *Step 6: VISA application process* - Since you have the Admission Acceptance Letter (AAL) in your hand and the admission team is guiding you at every step, the VISA approval is the last step to get you to India to start your dream education.

I hope these are clear as well?
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Well explained
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - Milan Edoofa: I am happy to hear that. Now that you have gone through all 6 steps, please feel free to share your thoughts and queries if you have any.
20/11/23, 1:36 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ok
20/11/23, 1:37 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I don't have any queries
20/11/23, 1:44 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I will kindly try to work extra hard as ordered  to receive AAL
20/11/23, 3:17 pm - Milan Edoofa: That is great to know. If we are on the same page and you are available for the further discussion, shall we start with the first step of the admission journey which is the *Message from the founder’s office*?
20/11/23, 3:41 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes we can no problem
20/11/23, 3:42 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We can proceed with our discussion
20/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Alright. In this step, the Founders of Edoofa have designed a session through a series of videos, to help students become successful in life. 

They have also shared their recommendations and insights on how to achieve maximum scholarship, how to go about the school, university selection, etc.
20/11/23, 4:19 pm - Milan Edoofa: Because these videos carry immense value, the academic board has instructed all Edoofians to watch them. I will now be sharing 4 videos with you, which you will have to watch and then share your understanding with me individually. 

For each video, I will give you a brief reference on why watching the videos is important so that you watch the videos with full and focused attention.

I hope you're doing well and feeling blessed. Please excuse me for the late reply. I am now active and ready to proceed with the session. If you're ready, please let me know so we can proceed.
23/11/23, 7:00 pm - +263 78 867 1027: How are you Mr Shivjeet, I'm active now let's proceed with our discussion
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing your understanding. I did go through your responses and I can see you did understand all the videos. 

*Video 1: Important Message for Enrolled Students*

The first video underscores the importance of two crucial qualities: open-mindedness and the ability to follow instructions. Edoofa's vision for its students is to foster success in their careers, and promote responsibility, and independence. A fundamental characteristic emphasized is the ability to follow instructions and cooperate, as these qualities are essential for future leadership and employment opportunities and hence we aim to impart the same to our students.
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 2: EDOOFA’s Vision for You*

Edoofa's vision for its students is to provide them with employment opportunities and the skills necessary to become future leaders. The program places students above other candidates by investing significant time and effort into finding reputable, education-focused institutions rather than solely business-oriented ones.
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 3: Schools, Colleges, and Universities under the EDOOFA Program*

In the third video, it is highlighted that Edoofa's founders have dedicated over a decade to meticulously identify reputable educational institutions. Students are advised to cultivate the right attitude, skills, and knowledge to excel in the job market. All the schools, colleges, and universities within the Edoofa program are carefully selected based on specific criteria, ensuring their quality and relevance to student's career goals.
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *Video 4: Preparation for Interactive Sessions with Schools - SOP*

The Statement of Purpose (SOP) is explained as a subjective document that students use to communicate with admission boards or schools. It encapsulates students' skills, strengths, achievements, aspirations, reasons for pursuing a specific course, and their motivation for seeking admission. Crafting a compelling SOP is essential for students seeking admission.
23/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In summary, these videos emphasize the significance of qualities such as open-mindedness, following instructions, and cooperation. Edoofa's vision is to empower students for successful careers and leadership roles by carefully selecting educational institutions. The SOP is a vital tool for effective communication and admission success. 

I hope you agree with all of this and were able to understand these by watching the four videos?
23/11/23, 7:46 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I understand
23/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Brilliant, Now with the videos, we have completed the first step of your university admission cycle *(Messages from the founder's office)*. Hence, we will move forward to the second step in your admission journey which is the statement of purpose.
23/11/23, 8:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, it is our responsibility to move your application ahead and help you to write a proper statement of purpose so that you can get into the best College/University that provides quality education that leads to the Job. So, for the team to work on your application and to make it ready to be shared with the universities, I suggest that you take your time now and try to complete the tasks by Tomorrow 2:30 PM.
23/11/23, 8:34 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: 1. I am sure you would have understood the importance and the role the Statement of purpose plays in your admission process from the 4th video that I shared earlier. This is the Statement of Purpose form. So, please fill it out carefully. After you submit the form, you will get a message that your response has been recorded. Please ensure to share the same screenshot with us here so that we can cross-check our records for the same.

27/11/23, 5:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Afternoon!

I hope you're doing well and shaking off those Monday blues as we step into a fresh new week. I was not able to connect with you as I was currently occupied. Please, how are you doing today?
27/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We are good thanks and how are you Mr Shivjeet
27/11/23, 6:22 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I'm now available for the session
27/11/23, 7:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for providing the details above . With this, we have successfully concluded the second step of your university admission process, enabling us to progress to the third step in your admission journey.

Before we delve into the forthcoming stage, I'd like to once again confirm our records: the course you've selected for your higher education is BA (Sociology) and it's my understanding that you're planning to arrive in India during August 2024. Could you kindly verify if the information I have is accurate?
27/11/23, 7:31 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes thus correct please
27/11/23, 7:40 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for sharing the confirmation. Now that we are done with the first and second steps in your admission journey, we can move towards the third step of your admission journey, i.e. *counseling on university admission*, are you ready to start with that?
27/11/23, 7:44 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Let's start I'm ready for the same
27/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Certainly. As we proceed with your university admission process, our main focus will be on completing your scholarship application and subsequently sharing it with universities that align with your chosen course and have been endorsed by the Edoofa Academic Board for your higher education.
27/11/23, 8:00 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: As part of our commitment, the Edoofa team will be responsible for submitting your application to multiple universities. Once these universities receive your application, they will take a day or two to evaluate your eligibility. If they find you eligible and decide to offer you a scholarship, you will receive an offer letter.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: This offer letter will contain comprehensive details, including the scholarship amount, annual tuition fees, accommodation costs, and the university registration fee. This information will provide you with a clear understanding of your precise annual educational expenses.
27/11/23, 8:01 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In the fortunate event that more than one university accepts your application, you may end up receiving multiple offer letters. Now with all these offer letters, I am sure you agree that it is not possible for a student to practically study at multiple universities, right?
27/11/23, 8:06 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I understand this
27/11/23, 8:07 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please I'm aware of this
27/11/23, 8:09 pm - +263 78 867 1027: So in this case if a student receives multiple offer letters from the universities he or she must choose from the list or the option comes from the Edoofa program
27/11/23, 9:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being online today with the session. As my available hours are coming to an end an it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow from 3:30 PM onwards and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.

28/11/23, 8:57 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please we can proceed I'm ready
29/11/23, 3:55 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Good afternoon Mr Shivjeet!


Hope you are doing well this afternoon
29/11/23, 7:19 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear Parents and my humble student.

I hope you are doing well this afternoon. Please excuse me for over the past couple of days, I wasn't able to have a proper conversation to proceed with this session and spend time with you, and I regret that to my students. The reason for my unavailability is the constant meetings with university officials for the performance as we near the end of this month.

With that said, I would like to let you know that I will be connecting with you on Monday to kick-start our session and ensure a productive one. Hence, please stay tuned for now and enjoy the rest of your day. Have a great weekend, and my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
29/11/23, 7:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: OK thank you for updating me Mr Shivjeet, thus okay
04/12/23, 6:36 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

How are you doing this evening?
04/12/23, 6:52 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We are good thanks and how are you Mr Shivjeet
04/12/23, 6:58 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready to proceed with today’s session?
04/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 77 170 2406: Good evening Mr Shivjeet, how are you
04/12/23, 7:03 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I'm ready we can proceed
04/12/23, 7:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Yes, that is correct and we will help you guide the same.
04/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Thus great to know
04/12/23, 8:16 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now among the various offer letters you receive, you will need to make a crucial decision regarding the university you wish to attend. This decision should consider crucial factors such as the university's exposure, its ranking, and affordability, in alignment with your and your family's preferences. Once you've made your decision, you have to proceed to reserve your scholarship seat at the chosen university accordingly.
04/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: To secure the scholarship seat, a student is required to pay a portion of their university fee, commonly referred to as the registration fee. This registration fee typically falls within the range of $500 to $1000. Once a student receives their scholarship offer letter from the university, they are given a timeframe of two to four weeks to submit this fee. This payment confirms their reservation of the scholarship seat and allows them to finalize their registration process.
04/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Ordinarily, this registration fee, which is essential to reserve the scholarship seat, is an additional cost. However, for students enrolled in the Edoofa Program, this fee is not an additional expense. Instead, it is considered a component of their first-year tuition fee. 

This fee needs to be settled while the students are still in their home country. By doing so, they secure their scholarship seat with the university. Once the student arrives in India, the paid registration fee is adjusted within their first-year fee, effectively reducing it to zero. I assume your counselor has also discussed the registration fee during your counseling sessions, correct?
04/12/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes we discussed about this
04/12/23, 8:26 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Noted
04/12/23, 8:59 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available today. As my available hours are coming to an end it was a long day for me. Let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
04/12/23, 9:00 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Same to you sir, thank you so much
05/12/23, 6:49 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents and My dear student!

I hope you are doing well today. May I know if you are ready to proceed with the session? <This message was edited>
05/12/23, 6:54 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Good evening Mr Shivjeet, we are good thanks and how are you doing over there?
05/12/23, 6:55 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I'm ready we can proceed with the session please
05/12/23, 6:56 pm - +263 77 170 2406: How are you please, we are good thanks
05/12/23, 7:26 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. 
That's excellent information to have. Now that you have a better understanding of the registration fee, allow me to further illustrate it with the aid of an example.

I am sure you are aware that the typical cost of a degree education in India ranges from $6000 to $8000 per year. However, due to your affiliation with Edoofa, you qualify for a scholarship on your tuition fee, effectively reducing this cost to just $2000 to $3000 per year. This all-inclusive amount encompasses the registration fee, remaining tuition fee, food expenses, accommodation charges, and other basic expenses. I hope we are on the same page?
05/12/23, 7:30 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please
05/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Now, for a clearer grasp of the registration process, let's consider an example. Assume the university you've selected for your higher education offers the following fee structure after applying for the scholarship:
05/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Tuition Fee: $1800 per annum
Food and Accommodation Fee: $1000 per annum 
Registration Fee: $750 (deadline within two weeks)

Total Fee: Tuition Fee $1800 + Food and Accommodation Fee $1000 = $2800 per annum
05/12/23, 7:50 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *I hope you have taken note of this example for the fee breakup?*
05/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes I understand this sir
05/12/23, 7:56 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Ye I did
05/12/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am glad to hear that. Now with this example, as you are aware that your registration fee due is $750, In order to reserve your scholarship seat, you will have to pay the same amount as per the deadline given to you by the university. When you make a payment of $750 towards the registration fee, it will be adjusted towards your first year’s fee, which is $2800 as per the above example.
05/12/23, 8:27 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Consequently, the remaining fee you'll need to pay after arriving in India will be $2800 - $750 = $2050. This amount can be paid in two installments of $1025 each. The initial installment is to be settled within the first three days of your arrival in India. 

Subsequently, the remaining balance of $1025 will be due in the month of January next year. There's also an option for students to pay this balance in monthly installments, but this is conditional on them starting the payment plan in the first month of their arrival. This flexibility helps students manage their finances effectively and ensures that the semester fee is paid on time before the designated semester due dates.
06/12/23, 6:44 am - +263 78 867 1027: Yeah I understand that please
06/12/23, 6:58 am - +263 78 867 1027: I did take note of this please, it's understandable
06/12/23, 6:33 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening dear parents and my dear student!

I trust this message finds you in good spirits. I am writing this message to you about my schedule from now and  the next seven days, specifically from December 7th to December 13th. During this time frame, I will be actively engaged in a series of meetings and discussions with our respective universities on multiple campuses and will be completely occupied within the time frame. And we will continue with our session from the 14th of December onwards again as usual. 

The objective of these discussions revolves around the ongoing evaluation and potential extension of our established endowment plan in collaboration with the university. Our intention is to delve deeper into the existing framework and explore options for an extended timeline which it will be discussed with you very soon, thereby ensuring a sustained and enhanced benefit for our students. With this, I would like you to please take care of yourself and your family, and always, warm regards to you all until we meet again.
06/12/23, 6:34 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Noted with thanks
06/12/23, 6:46 pm - +263 77 170 2406: Thus great to know please
14/12/23, 6:14 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Good Evening, dear parents, and Rumbidzai!

It has been a while now, and I am happy to let you know that I am back. Please, how are you doing today?
14/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Good evening, are good how are you too.
14/12/23, 6:15 pm - +263 78 867 1027: We are good and how are you
14/12/23, 6:17 pm - +263 78 867 1027: It's a pleasure to connect with you today after some time.
14/12/23, 6:30 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I am great, thank you for asking. May I know if you are ready for a quick session?
14/12/23, 6:30 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please I'm ready
14/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: I'm glad to hear that you're following along. As you may recall, while you're in your home country, your primary focus will be on paying the university's registration fee. This step is crucial for reserving your scholarship seat. Along with these expenses, you'll have to pay for your visa fee and flight expenses. Any other fee components related to the university can be paid after your arrival in India.
14/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Once you complete the university admission process by successfully paying the registration fee, an important linkage will be established. Your "Earn While You Learn" (EWYL) credits account becomes seamlessly connected to the university's fee account. From this juncture onward, the credits you earn through the EWYL program can be readily adjusted toward your annual university fees.
14/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: In practical terms, this means that after completing your registration fee payment, your journey toward financial flexibility commences. Your EWYL credits can be applied to your university fees annually, reducing your financial burden. This framework is designed to offer you greater ease in managing your financial commitments as you progress through your education.
14/12/23, 6:31 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Furthermore, upon fulfilling the registration fee payment, you'll receive the Admission Acceptance Letter. This document will serve as a pivotal asset in both securing your admission and facilitating the acquisition of your student visa.

Before we move forward, I would like to ask if you have any queries with respect to how the admission process unfolds and what the costs will be for your admission process and your higher education?
14/12/23, 6:36 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I understand this
14/12/23, 6:37 pm - +263 78 867 1027: I don't have any queries about this please I'm understanding it
14/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Alright please, I understand. Now with this, we are done with the step 3, and shortly after our discussion today, we will move forward to the fourth step in your admission cycle which is the *Offer Letter from the University*. You can expect to get the offer letter within the next three to five days as per the procedures and we hope you as a family are excited to receive the same and move forward to your next set of steps.
14/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The offer letter you receive will indeed serve as the stepping stone to the smiles our Edoofians have when they land at the airport here in India. It signifies the beginning of an exciting journey towards academic and personal growth. We are committed to providing you with the support and resources needed to make this journey a successful and enriching one
14/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Having said that, I want to share an incredibly inspiring image of the arrival of our 2023 batch. This picture has not only ignited my motivation but also fueled my determination to elevate the quality of services we offer to our students. I am confident that, upon receiving your offer letter, you will be equally driven to secure your scholarship seat and become the accomplished Edoofian we wholeheartedly support and believe in.
14/12/23, 6:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: <Media omitted>
14/12/23, 6:41 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes thus true we will be more than excited
14/12/23, 6:42 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Yes please good to hear that
14/12/23, 6:45 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Nice
14/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: The hard work and dedication of our Student community have played a significant role in strengthening the partnership between Edoofa and our esteemed universities. It is heartening to see that our commitment to delivering quality education and facilitating bright futures for our students has not only met but exceeded expectations.

Our universities recognize us as a valuable resource, and the student community echoes this sentiment. Together, we have created a synergy that not only meets the educational needs of our students but also enhances the overall academic experience.
14/12/23, 7:08 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: We are proud to have delivered on our promise to secure the most affordable fees for our previous students, and we remain determined to continue this endeavor for the benefit of our current and future students. Quality higher education should be accessible to all, and Edoofa is committed to making that a reality.

14/12/23, 8:17 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Amazing, in that case, let us start with the first benefit of the Endowment Plan -
14/12/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *1. Gain First Access to Scholarship Seats in Leading Indian Universities through Edoofa.*

On the basis of your A-Level/Statement of Entry and O-Level results, your responses to the Academic Interview Questions, and your Statement of Purpose, we will be able to apply for a scholarship at the universities, and the universities will take a few days of time for the evaluation.  

Upon completion of the evaluation, you will receive your letter of intent (Offer Letter) from the university where your scholarship percentage and fees will be mentioned and after you complete your registration formalities, you will be presented with your Official Admission Letter with the help of which you would be able to apply for the student visa.
14/12/23, 8:18 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: But here's the exhilarating benefit: While the universities have yet to open admissions for regular students of the 2024 intake, they have extended an exclusive invitation to Edoofa students to kickstart their admission process under the Endowment plan while benefiting from the same.

This means you, as an Edoofa student, have the prestigious privilege of securing your seat before the competition even begins. You will be the trailblazer among your peers, firmly positioning yourself as a frontier person in this endeavor.
14/12/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Okay
14/12/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 867 1027: That is  great to know this
14/12/23, 8:24 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Then for this one I didn't send you my O level results so will kindly do so
14/12/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: *2. Lock- in the post-scholarship fee structure of the previous academic year thereby saving valuable additional dollars.*

I'm delighted to share this benefit with you. Each year, universities review and adjust their fee structures, and it's quite likely that there might be an increase in fees for the academic year 2024. Historically, we've observed tuition fee hikes of around 20%-30% over the past few years. To assist our students in managing these changes, we've introduced a beneficial provision.
14/12/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: With the Endowment Program, you have the remarkable opportunity to maintain their fee structure in alignment with the current academic year of 2023. This strategic choice enables you to preserve your fee structure throughout the entirety of your bachelor's education in India.
14/12/23, 8:46 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Even in the scenario where there's a fee increase for the 2024 admission intake, which is your intended year of entry, you'll remain safeguarded against such changes. Your fee structure will remain consistent with that of 2023. Does this explanation resonate with you?
14/12/23, 9:13 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Thank you for being available. I really appreciate you being online with me. As my available hours are coming to an end and it was a long day for me, let's reconnect tomorrow and continue this session. Have a great night, and please extend my warm regards to your lovely family as well.
14/12/23, 10:57 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Well understood please, I'm following up
14/12/23, 10:58 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Thank you, same to you

20/12/23, 1:39 pm - Shivjeet Edoofa: Greetings, dear parent and my dear student!

I would like to share an update with you: starting today, I will no longer be serving as your admission officer. I wanted to inform you that Ms. Ashi will be taking over from now on, and she will be reaching out to you very soon.

Over the past 12 months, I have had the privilege of serving as the admission officer for you and many other students. It has been a great experience getting to know the potential of my students and spending valuable time discussing their aspirations. However, every journey has its end, and now it's time for me to embark on a new chapter.

Rest assured, the exceptional service and support you have received will continue seamlessly as Ms. Ashi, one of our accomplished admission officers, takes over your admission journey from this point forward. I wish you the very best on your journey. Goodbye, my dear student.

Yours sincerely,
Mr. Shivjeet
Admission Officer
20/12/23, 1:43 pm - +263 78 867 1027: Thank you so much Mr Shivjeet for your support much appreciated, also thank you for updating me on this issue.
