There are several factors that motivated me to apply for the Edoofa Scholarship program.

1) The unbearable tuition fees in Zimbabwean universities first motivated me to apply for the scholarship program.

2) The Earn as you learn program offered by The Edoofa Scholarship program also motivated me to like and apply for the scholarship program 

3) The quality of education in India also pushed me to apply for the scholarship program and made me have interest to study in India. 


Qsn 2
My understanding of the programme when I was discussing it with Takudzwa was that it is real and not fake. Also I understand there are some students whp are there, so that put confidence in me. I aslo understand that the program have a lot of benefits for example  earn as you learn program which enables students to have scholarship credits and have their own money to sustain themselves when in need

Rhodyn Richmore Makaza is my name and I'm from Manicaland province. I was born in 2001 in Chimanimani district. My father was Josphat and he died in 2011when I was 10 and in grade 3 at Ndima Primary school which is about 3km away from our homestead. He was a carpenter and Swere Ngidi my mother took the burden over her shoulders and sent us, my twin sister Rholyn and I, to school. 
 
We then finished grade seven at Mutsvangwa primary school, 5km close to the Mozambican border, and mom was senting us to school with money got from piece works. We both get 6 units and was pleasing. 

We then went to Ndima Gvt High for the secondary education and there the fees was the challenge. Richman Makaza, my late father's young brother chipped in for the first 2 terms and he had a challenge since he is a driver and he had a family and childrn to take of too. So mother struggled to sent us to school till we finished ordinary level. I want to tahnk Richman for the support he gave us. We passed all the 8 subjects including Hexco to make them 9 with pleasing symbols. We then did A level in 2019 at Mafumise high school in the outskirts of chipinge districts and mother was bearing the burden for two more years. Richman chipped in registering exams snd I appreciated that. 

My mother earn money but selling bananas in fruit markets. Now my twin sister is at Mutare poly doing IT. I gave her the opportunity to go to tetiary education since mom couldn't afford to pay fees for us sinse tge fees are unbearable. So I'm now home. I was looking for this opportunity and I always included it in my prayers. 

I finished A level in 2020 and I got 11 points. I had MATHS,  BUSINESS STUDIES AND ECONOMICS  at A level.

We paid $45 per term
My mother got married when she was form 2. 

So far I will appeal to those who would want to help me funding my education abroad
